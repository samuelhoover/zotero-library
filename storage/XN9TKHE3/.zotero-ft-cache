Abstract. It is argued that polymer solutions can be classified into three broad types which may be characterized in terms of N the total number of (micro) molecules, n the number of polymer chains, 1 the effective length of a micromole-
cule, v the excluded volume per micromolecule and V the total volume. The types
are: (I) dense solutions in which V / N < v , (E) intermediate concentrations in
which L9/5v315Z->3/V5/n> v or (Ll)l@> V/n> v according to the magnitude
of v, i.e. L - 1 ~ 1 0 v - 1 ~ 5gZre7at~er1t0han 1 or less than 1, and (iii) dilute solutions in which V / n < L s ~ 5 v 3 ~ 5 1T- h3e~ 5in.termediate case is discussed in detail and the partial pressure of the molecules is found to be given by

A discussion is given of the way this expression fails as one enters regions (i) and (ui).

1. Introduction

Although a fully realistic theory of polymer solutions will involve considerable

technical complexity in such matters as the precise flexibility of the molecular linkages

and. the molecular forces, and the nature of the interaction of the molecules with those

of the solvent, there remains a core of general functional relationships in, for example,

the equationof state, which can be reduced to problems which are easilyposed, but which

only be resolved by fairly powerful mathematical tools. I n this paper it is hoped to

derive this skeieton theory in which the dependence of the thermodynamic functions

upon the parameters specifying the solution will be demonstrated. Firstly one must

specify the quantities on which the system will depend. These will be as follows: V the

volume of the system, T the temperature, n the number of polymer chains present, which

W d l be assumed to be all of the same length and constructed of m molecules each of

These parameters are sufficient to describe several rCgknes of polymer solutio^ so
these are now enumerated. Firstly, one can have a dense solution and almost eve-y molecule of every chain is in contact with several others. It is clear that the excluded volume .pameter described above is quite inadequate to describe this system, and it will not be attempted in this paper. It is clear from the virial expansion of a dense gas
that this dense state corresponds to having a volume of polymer comparable with be
volume of solvent, i.e. V N Nv. But at lower densities of polymer one can discem mo
rCgimes which are amenableto treatment. One can reach the condition V $ Nv andyet have a rather homogeneous system because of the length of the chains, i.e. as in be sketch in figure 1. In figure 1the system is dilute but the size of a chain greatly exceeds

Figure 1.
Figure 2. the spacing of a chain. Supposing the configuration of a chain to be that of a random
walk, it will, roughly speaking, occupy a region of space of the order of (U)''i'n d~
meter. The mean spacingof chains is (V / B ) ' /s~o,one has the rCgime of figure 1
that (U)'"> (V/n)'I3. This rCgime will be characterized by a mean density
fluctuations. But if the density of chains decreases further the density will becofne increasingly lumpy till the chains separate (it should be remembered mean forces are operating) and figure 2 is a good description of this.

Thisis an intermediate state to that of complete separation when the chains behave
asmolecular balls (figure3). To give criteria for the validity of the different pictures it is
useful to reduce all the physical quantities to lengths. The four basic quantities are &en lo = w1l3, 1, ro = (Y/n)1’3rl, = (U)’a/nd’it;will prove useful to add two derived
5 = ( 1 2 n ~ L / V l ~ ) -an”d~q = (vL/Z)’/~q,3 being the effective volume of the
molecules in one chain.

Figure 3.
< Then the dense rCgime is q N ro. The dilute rCgime of figure 3 is rl r,, with a
furtherclassification accordingto whether lrI2is greater or less than lo3,a criterion which decides ifthe chain follows the random walk or excluded volume laws. The intermediate region will be shown to exist provided that
lo< 14 q < ro < 6 < r l .
Since it is consistent that all these parameters can be experimentally adjusted to this niterion, this is a perfectly feasible rCgime and happens to be amenable to calculation
leadingto a solubleequation of state. A discussion will also be given on how thisrCgime tends, via figure 2, to the dilute rCgime, figure 3, but although the qualitative picture is
clear an exact description does not appear possible.

2. The formulation of the problem

The reason that there is a problem is that, when two chains interact at one point A, there is an enhvlced probability that they will inteiact ai aiiother B, simply because They are chains (figure4). This is quite different from the multiple collisions giving rise in

lessthanthis value because of non-free hinging, which to some extent should be present
inheBoltzmannfactor, for neighbouring links will not be correctlytreated by the pseudopotend, for example they cannot meet with arbitrary relative orientation. Since in he present solutions variation of the total volume of the system cannot effect these linkages, (2.14) will be taken to represent the system truly and g taken to be a constant. Equation (2.6) should strictly be an integration over the coordinates and orientation of eachmolecule in the chain, but it is much more convenient to run it into the continuum. kt this point a transformation used previously in a polymer problem by the author ;awards 1965, 1966) is adopted. It is well known that the exponential of two-body forces can be written as the Gaussian average of a potential associated formally with the fields, i.e.

Thtrick is equivalent to the situation in electrostatics where one can discussthe interacO!n of point charges by having a (Coulomb) potential between them, or by saying they mteractwith an electric field which satisfiesPoisson's equation. The first point of view is that of (2.6). Since one can evaluate (2.7) by completing the square, i.e.

where

clearlythis latter equation is the analogue of Poisson's equation and x1 of the electrostatic
potential. If o(r) is taken to be v8(r) its inverse is V18(r), but thismust be treated with
caution when R,(L') = R,(L") (the equivalent of y = p in the model) and a more refined
o(r) employed near the point. The transformation has now decoupled the chains. he
can now consider each chain moving in a field x, the averaging over x being equivalent to stating that x is caused by the other chain. Having decoupled the chains, it is well
known that the functional average over 6R, is equivalent to a differential equation.
Suppose the chain R, starts at r,(O) and ends at ra(L),then

3. Polymer solutions at intermediate densities Although formulae (2.16) and (2.18) are equivalent, their form suggeststhat theyvd
be useful in different circumstances. In (2.18) the fact that there were n chains
appears in the factor n log I?. The exponent contains only an integrated out form. This
suggests that it is a good starting point when the system itself is rather homogeneous! i.e. as in figure 1. From this point of view one may forget all about chains and just
think of fieldsx. There will be a mean field correspondingto the mean polymer denWt
and then fluctuations about this mean. The mean field must be a constant in space, so writing

If o(r) is treated as a 6 function for large L, one obtains the term
(3.13)
being the first term in the expansion of the logarithm in (3.11). The correct form of (3.11) is then obtained by allowing an improved accuracy in v(r) for single chains, whereupon the pseudo-potential can be successfully used, i.e. (3.11) should be re placed by

where v ( m ) is the true Fourier transform of v(r). In effect the trouble comes from allowingthe chain to interact with itself at apoint, and a precise treatment of the interaction of a (micro) molecule with its nearest neighbours in the chain is already sufficient to make the integral convergent. The self-interaction of the chain is independentof V as one would expect and therefore does not alter the equation of state; so it will be called

(3.21)
can be physically interpreted this way. The nKT represents the pressure of n units, in this case the chains. The &V(M/V)xTis the contribution expected to PV from
!v units when the whole total effective volume is M. Since this term arose from the
smoothed average interactions the fact that the sets of m units were in chains does not deea b e answer which is the same correction as would be expected in an imperfect gas of b e molecules moving independently. The fact that there are chains appears in be 1st term. The length f has the character of a Debye-Huckel radius, and this term represents the fact that, when two molecules of two chains interact, there is an increased probability that two other molecules of these chains interact also since the existence of the chains constrains a high density of molecules to be near any particular molecule. This enhanced probability is modified by the interference of other chains getting in the
way, and 5 representsthat distanceoverwhichan enhancedprobabilitywillbe experienced.
It will be seen that for long enough chains the perfect gas term will not dominate, though it will always do so at the 8 temperature where v = 0. The criterion for the expansion
of log G in x can be obtained by examiniig the contribution of higher terms, and turns
out to be rO[f< 1 where 703 = V/nthe volume per chain. The validity of (3.21) is therefore bounded at the high density end by the condition M[V < 1which is the normal condition fora virial expansion,and by the condition70 < f ,stemming from the necessity to exclude multiple 'collective' collisions. That there are two criteria is a consequence of the presence of two different effects and hence there are three lengths (or whatever dnnension one wishes to express it in) to be compared. To understand how the analysis siven here fails at the low density end one may consider how the behaviour of a single chain is influenced by its neighbours, and this is considered in the next section.
4. The behaviour of a chain in the solution
The formal analysis for a single chain is simple, for cleariy the probability of the chain starting at 7' and ending at 7 at length L is given by
(p(r, r';L ) ) = G(r, r';L; h])exp((n- 1) log F - i [jxv-lx)Sx

which clearly stems from the original definition of v as a pseudo-potential (and is indeed
o(r-r’)in general) and a term resulting from the interference due to the chain natureof

a strong reduction. One can see the origin of this behaviour in this way. Suppose one represents :he p o l p e r by a full line, and the interaction by a dotted line. Theo the interaction of a chain with itself to order, i.e. a single interaction, is as shown in figure 6.

Figure 6.
But other chains will get in the way resulting in a long-range effect building up (figure7)’ The sum of all these effects is the effective potential (4.8). One can understand the that the correction is an attraction by remembering that it is the fluctuations which are
under discussion. The mean interactions have been allowed for in x0, and the effectOf

he other chains is to try to bring the system back to the mean and counter the direct o(f-r’) term. The effect of the other chains is therefore to weaken the self-interaction

tion shows that the self-interaction of the chain can be represented by the difision of a

particle in a (complex) random potential. Now the motion of a particle in a random potential is described by the Boltzmann equation for the Lorentz gas, which suggests that an equation of this form is also appropriate in the present problem. Since the derivationof this equation is standard and it will not be used further in this paper, it will Simply be quoted. Let the mean (G) have Fourier transformg,,(L), then

where the new terms ensure the conservation of probability ( p , ) = 1. This equation for ( p ) has been developed here for the case of 6 large, i.e. a high density of chains, and
so the interaction term in (4.11) is small. When the density of chains decreases the behaviour of a chain becomes more and more dominated by itself, i.e. whereas in a dense solution encounters are nearly always between different chains in a dilute solution they Tenearlyalwaysbetween the same chain. (Thisstatement will not be true for the interachen of a molecule with near neighbours of the same chain and there will always be some
Pm of the interaction term in (2.4)which is not properly accounted for. This must be
+ded by methods analogous to the use of exact scattering cross sections (‘tmatrices’) multiple scatteringproblems. The effectof these inescapablenear-neighbour encoun-
ters will be mainly to alter the available phase space, and to a lesser effect to alter the effectivestep length and very slightly the distribution function, so providing that it is yyed that the various constants appearing in our discussion are not immediately ldenaablewith experimental values, all should go through. This point is of course well

understood in polymer problems and is further noted below.) Consider then the other extreme of an isolated chain. This has been treated elsewhere by the author (Edwards 1965, 1966) and the results will be quoted here. Consider one end of the chain at the
origin and consider adding the last link on to the chain. Suppose for the moment that the chain is Gaussian. It is known that it starts at the origin and of course that it ends at the given end point which will be called the current point. Since it went through &e end point there must be a considerably enhanced probability of finding the chain in
the neighbourhood of the end point, but this enhanced probability will give rise to &e interaction term of (4.11) and be absorbed into changes in entropy per link, effective step length and so on. But it also started at the origin. There is, therefore, an enhanced probability of finding it near the origin, an enhanced probability which will die away the further one gets from the origin. This probability will be

/ ; P ( r , L')dL'
which for a very long Gaussian chain is 3 / d . This term will produce an effective repulsive potential at the origin which is sensibly thought of in those terms. It is not sensible to consider an effective potential around the current point since one would be always at its origin as the chain buildsup, and this term is better thought of as a scattering term. Now a Coulomb potential is well known to have dominant behaviour at large distances so it is clear that the assumption that the chain is, even in its first approximation, Gaussian must be inadequate and a self-consistent argument developed.

But as rl --f r2the two regions of high density coalesce;this process cannot be considered in any sense a perturbation of the separated chains since the whole problem is that of a self-consistent field which is virtually unrelated to the random flight unperturbed form. The calculation of the virial series has been considered by several authors and has been recently reviewed by Stockmayer (1960). The method here has the advantage of
being systematic and allowing full weight to the correlations within the chams, so
that it appears doubtful if the virial coefficients can be obtained without heavy numerid work. A closer study of (5.11)-(5.12) suggests that the coefficienta, will be proportional to v3’5L9’5for long chains but the numerical coefficient will require a calculation comparable with a molecular self-consistent field.

It would appear that between the very dense region (which is as yet functiody intractable) and the very dilute region (which is functionally tractable, but exceedingly hard work) there existsa region which is theoreticallytractable and the author hopesto be able to check the validity of the equation of state suggested here with experimental studies taking place in the polymer chemistry group at Manchester.
