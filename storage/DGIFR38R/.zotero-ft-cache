Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is one of the promising ways to significantly reduce the CO2 emission from power plants. In particular, amongst several separation strategies, adsorption by nano-porous materials is regarded as a potential means to efficiently capture CO2 at the place of its origin in a post-combustion process. The search for promising materials in such a process not only requires the screening of a multitude of materials but also the development of an adequate evaluation metric. Several evaluation criteria have been introduced in the literature concentrating on a single adsorption or material property at a time. Parasitic energy is a new approach for material evaluation to address the energy load imposed on a power plant while applying CCS. In this work, we evaluate over 60 different materials with respect to their parasitic energy, including experimentally realized and hypothetical materials such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), porous polymer networks (PPNs), and zeolites. The results are compared to other proposed evaluation criteria and performance differences are studied regarding the regeneration modes, (i.e. Pressure-Swing (PSA) and Temperature-Swing Adsorption (TSA)) as well as the flue gas composition.
Broader context
The steady increase of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere reveals the imperative need for performing Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) in power plants. One separation technology considered to accomplish this task is CO2 adsorption with solid nanoporous materials. The question we address in this work is how to meaningfully screen and rank the enormous amount of possible materials to identify the most suitable ones. We argue that parasitic energy is a useful metric which predicts the total energy penalty imposed on a power plant by conducting CCS on a material-by-material basis as it combines several thermodynamic properties. This work aims to relate the concept of parasitic energy and its advantages to other criteria that have been used as a metric for carbon capture. It reveals the main source for the electricity loss providing important insights into the energetic costs for power companies and demonstrates how the CO2 concentration inuences the selection of the optimal material. We rank a large set of experimental and hypothetical structures to identify the best material for CCS which could potentially reduce the energy penalty on a power plant compared to the state-of-art technology, amine scrubbing. We anticipate that this metric will be well-suited to conduct high-throughput screenings of large material databases.
1 Introduction
The continuous increase in the world's energy demand has resulted in an increased use of fossil fuels.1–3 The burning of
these fossil fuels has led to a 30% increase of the carbon dioxide concentration in the last 100 years. To reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Socolow and co-workers4 proposed the strategy of wedges in which a wedge represents the implementation of a technology to reduce the carbon emission by 25 billion tonnes over a period of 50 years. To stabilize the emissions at the level of 2006, one needs to implement at least 7 different wedges. In pursuit of this strategy, Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) plays an important role as CCS is one of the few, if not only, viable technologies that can deal with the emission of fossil fuels. Given that more than 80% of our current energy consumption is based on fossil fuels,5 the implementation of new technologies is urgent and CCS is one of the few that can be implemented now. In CCS, carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured from the ue gas of a power plant, compressed in order to transport it as a supercritical uid, and subsequently injected into geological formations.1 However, the energy intensive

separation and subsequent compression as well as the requirement of power plants to build a gas separation unit are the driving factors in the costs of CCS. There are several main strategies to capture carbon from the ue gas of a power plant, two of which are oxy-combustion and post-combustion.1,6,7 In oxy-combustion, oxygen is removed from the air and nearly pure oxygen is fed into the combustion process in a power plant. As the fossil fuel is burned with nearly pure oxygen, the ue gas contains mainly water and CO2. Hence, carbon capture can now be performed by less energy intensive gas cleanup. However, separating oxygen from air is an expensive process, as it requires cryogenic distillation.1,6 The post-combustion strategy is to capture the carbon directly from the ue gas of the power plant. One advantage of the postcombustion carbon capture is that it can be added to an existing power plant more easily.1,6 Fig. 1 gives a process ow sheet of a facility with a post-combustion CCS unit. At present, three different separation technologies are considered for post-combustion: absorption, membranes, and adsorption. Natural gas oen contains more CO2 than is allowed in pipelines which requires the CO2 to be separated. The technology to “sweeten” natural gas has been developed by Bottoms8 in 1930 and involves scrubbing with Mono-Ethanol-Amine (MEA). This technology can be adopted to capture CO2 from ue gases.9,10 Excellent separation performance can be achieved using MEA and other amines but the respective regeneration step is energy intensive. Due to the strong binding of CO2 to the amines, the amine solutions have to be boiled to remove the CO2 and regenerate the solvent. At a maximum amine concentration of about 30%, most of the energy is used to boil the water. Although a large fraction of this heat can be recovered, adding the MEA process and subsequent compression to a power plant reduces its efficiency by as much as 30%.1,6 In
addition, the oxygen in the ue gas causes the amines to degenerate. At present, however, amine scrubbing is the only technology that is sufficiently advanced to be applied in CCS. Finding alternative technologies aimed at mitigating some of the disadvantages of these amine solutions is an active area of research which focuses on membrane and adsorption technologies. Membrane separations are based on differences in the permeability of different components.1,6 The driving force for membrane separation comes from the difference in the components' partial pressures on the two sides of the membrane. As post-combustion carbon capture is an end-ofpipe technology, the pressure of the ue gas is too low for a sufficient pressure gradient. This can be remedied by compressing the ue gases or pulling vacuum which, however, requires a signicant amount of energy due to the large ue gas volumes involved in the separation.11 The ue gas can be compressed or pressurized ve-fold by using 10–20% of the produced energy for compression or pulling vacuum.12 These practical limitations have important consequences for the design of a membrane separation process.12 Hence, nding novel membrane materials is of great interest to the whole scientic community.13–19 Alternatively, CO2 can be captured through adsorption in the pores of solid materials.20–22 This technology takes advantage of the preferential adsorption of CO2 in the pores of adsorbents compared to other ue gas components. Nano-porous materials – like zeolites,23 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs),24 porous polymer networks (PPNs),25 and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)22 – can have large internal surfaces and high selectivities towards CO2 depending on their structure and composition.20 Particularly, MOFs have attracted great attention due to the enormous number of possible combinations of different metals and organic linkers.20,22 To date, over 5000 different MOFs have been synthesized.26 The sparked interest is evident from the number of published articles with MOFs as the main topic which has increased by a factor of seven between 1999 and 2007. Such a large number of materials raises the important practical question which criteria are best suited to evaluate their performance. For most people the answer to this question will be related to the cost increase of electricity caused by implementing CCS. The best material will be the one for which the full life cycle analysis gives the smallest increase in the price of electricity. Many of the materials that we are investigating in this work, however, are in such an early stage of research that we simply do not have any insights into the overall costs of the complete process. It is therefore important to develop a next best criterion that captures some of the key aspects that contribute to the cost of a carbon capture process that uses this material. Comparing the liquid absorption with a solid adsorption process, the important difference to note is the relative simplicity with which a liquid can be transported. As a consequence it is also simple to develop a continuous process which includes full heat integration. This allows us to recover the heat required to regenerate the absorbent. In a solid process, however, heat integration is more difficult to realize which is

The generated steam is transformed into electricity through a steam turbine. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), mercury, and sulfur oxides (SOx) are removed from the flue gas. Low pressure steam from the steam turbine is used to provide the heating in the carbon capture process. The resulting high purity CO2 is compressed to final transportation and storage conditions by a compressor. Flue gas residue, mainly N2, is emitted into the atmosphere.

why one has to ensure the minimization of the energy required to regenerate the adsorbent. Another important CCS contribution which needs to be included in the evaluation of a material is the cost caused by the compression of CO2 for geological storage. Given that energy requirements contribute signicantly to the overall cost of carbon capture, one would never consider a novel adsorbent with energy requirements signicantly higher than the current MEA process. A rst screening would hence be based on the prediction of the total energy penalty imposed on a power plant by applying CCS. This concept of energy penalty or parasitic energy was rst introduced by Rochelle and co-workers in 2009.27 The characteristic of parasitic energy is to express the energy requirement for ue gas separation and subsequent CO2 compression in terms of loss in electricity production. This work concentrates on the performance of porous materials for a post-combustion CCS process in power plants using a Temperature-Pressure-Swing Adsorption (TPSA) process. We compare different materials and criteria that have been proposed to evaluate the potential performance of these materials. In this comparison we look at capturing CO2 from the ue gas of coal and natural gas red power plants, and carbon capture directly from air.
2 Carbon capture process
2.1 Adsorption process
Fig. 2 illustrates the four subsequent steps in an adsorption process. We start with a clean, regenerated bed. During the adsorption step ue gas ows through the bed and the CO2 selectively adsorbs, leaving a N2 rich exhaust stream. Once the bed is saturated the bed needs to be regenerated. This can be done by applying a vacuum and/or by increasing the temperature to conditions where the CO2 desorbs resulting in a CO2 rich stream for subsequent sequestration. The process is called Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) if we use pressure and temperature, respectively. It is also possible to increase both the temperature and change the pressure, called a Temperature-Pressure-Swing Adsorption (TPSA) process. In addition, it should be noted that compression of the CO2 rich stream is required for transportation and sequestration. Several methods to evaluate materials for their CCS performance have been proposed.28–30 These methods typically use adsorption related properties such as the uptake, selectivity, working capacity, breakthrough time, surface area, or porosity as criteria to rank materials.30–36 Most of these criteria aim to maximize the adsorption capacity of a material, or aim to correlate the performance to structural properties like surface area, pore volume, and pore size. As we will show in this work, the difficulty with these single property criteria lies in the assumption that the materials all perform optimally under the conditions for which we compare the performance. Moreover, a CCS process requires CO2 sequestration at high pressures, whereas, for instance, optimization of adsorption capacity or breakthrough time only focuses on the adsorption process but does not consider the regeneration and compression steps. To address these issues, we used parasitic energy as a metric which
also takes into account the optimization of desorption conditions in the design of a separation process. The metric is a measure for the loss of electricity caused by the addition of a CCS process to an existing power plant with respect to a given solid adsorbent. In this context, the best material is the one that minimizes the parasitic energy. This results in a more abstract metric difficult to relate to material properties which is why it is instructive to compare parasitic energy to the more conventional criteria.
2.2 Energetics of carbon capture
In the following we discuss the parasitic energy metric in detail and compute the minimal energy required to carry out a twocomponent gas separation. 2.2.1 Parasitic energy. In our simplied process the total energy required to perform CCS is composed of two parts: the heat required to carry out the separations and the energy spent to compress the captured CO2 up to 150 bar. The former consists of two terms: (1) the energy needed to heat up the adsorber to reach the desorption conditions (sensible heat), and (2) the energy required to undo the adsorption process. For the endothermic process of CO2 desorption we need to supply energy that is equivalent to the heat of adsorption (Dh). The total thermal energy Qthermal per kilogram of captured CO2, mCO2 is hence given by:
Qthermal 1⁄4 CpmsorbentDT
mCO2
þ DhCO2 DsCO2 þ DhN2 DsN2
mCO2
(1)
The rst term corresponds to the sensible heat requirement which drives the process through heating up the bed. It can be calculated using the specic heat capacity Cp of the adsorbent,
Fig. 2 Four steps in a temperature and pressure swing adsorption process. In the first step CO2 adsorption takes place while flue gas pervades the solid adsorbent. N2 enriched gas leaves the bed. To initiate the regeneration process the solid bed is heated up and evacuated in the second step. CO2 is forced to desorb from the surface and CO2 rich gas is exiting the adsorbent. In step three the solid is purged by N2 gas to eliminate the left over CO2 residue. The final step is the preparation for the next adsorption cycle. The adsorbent is cooled down and pressurized until adsorption conditions are reached again.

the total mass of the adsorbent msorbent, and the temperature difference between adsorption and desorption conditions (Tnal  Tue). The second part of the thermal energy represents the energy needed to desorb both gases, CO2 and N2, which consists of the working capacities Dsi multiplied by the heat of adsorption Dhi for each ue gas component. The working capacity is dened as the difference in the amount adsorbed under ue gas conditions (1 atm, 40 C) and le in the material under desorption conditions. Note that we calculate msorbent in eqn (1) as r(1  3)V using the sorbent's density r, a xed void fraction 3 of 0.35, and a xed volume V of 1 m3. The second contribution to the parasitic energy involves the compression of CO2 to transport and storage conditions (150 bar).1 A model of a multi-stage compressor was used to estimate the pumping work to compress our captured gas. A maximum pressure ratio of each stage was set to 2.5 to avoid an extreme temperature increase of the captured gas. Additionally, the gas was cooled to 40 C between each compression cycle. The isentropic efficiency of the pump was assumed to be 85% for gas below the supercritical point and 90% above it. The model is based on data which captures the real uid properties of mixtures with different purities and their changing behavior at the critical point during compression. We obtained the data using NIST REFPROP.37 This database includes the equation of state38 for uid mixtures containing different gas components, like CO2, N2 and others. Additionally, the compression energy mainly depends on the CO2 gas purity and the gas pressure at which desorption takes place. Thus, to make the model practical for screening, we developed a functional representation to estimate the compression work for a range of desorption pressures and CO2 purities. This allowed us to avoid using REFPROP for every single combination of CO2 purity and desorption pressure.39 Note that, in general, two separate pumping contributions are involved in our process. On the one hand, there is the pumping work to evacuate the sorbent to realize the desorption pressure below 1 atm. In addition, we also need pumping work to compress the captured gas from the desorption pressure to 150 bar. In reality, however, both happen in parallel. While compressing captured gas from the desorption pressure (below 1 atm) to storage conditions, the pump also creates a low-pressure which we use in the pressure swing operation to reach the desorption pressure. Hence, we do not have to count both contributions but count only the main pumping cost created by compressing the gas from desorption conditions to 150 bar. Moreover, in our model we assume that steam from the power plant is used as a heat source and that the compressors are driven by the produced electricity directly. As steam is not converted with 100% efficiency into electricity, we need to multiply the heat requirement with the Carnot efficiency hcarnot 1⁄4 1  Tc/Th and the efficiency of a gas turbine (75%):40
Eparasitic 1⁄4 (0.75Qthermalhcarnot) + Wcomp (2)
In this equation, the implicit variable is the desorption condition. The desorption condition determines not only the working capacity but also the CO2 purity for the compression
energy. For example, by changing the desorption temperature one can ensure identical working capacities of two materials. Still, the material with the lower desorption temperature will have a lower parasitic energy due to the cooler steam required. As an alternative one can obtain the same working capacities by changing the desorption pressure; the one with the lowest compression cost would then be the best material. Hence, the optimal desorption conditions are those that minimize this parasitic energy. 2.2.2 Minimum energy. We can use elementary thermodynamics to calculate the minimum energy for separating CO2 from a two-component gas mixture. It is reasonable to approximate ue gas as an ideal gas mixture. We can therefore estimate the minimum energy requirement from the ideal gas entropy of mixing.11 The molar entropy of an ideal gas mixture containing a mole fraction x of CO2 is given by:
sim(x) 1⁄4 R[x ln x + (1  x)ln(1  x)] (3)
where R is the gas constant.1 If we assume that the separation is carried out at a temperature Tsep, the minimal energy required for the separation can be determined using the captured, emitted, and the ue gas entropies via:
W sep
min 1⁄4 TsepDS with
DS 1⁄4 nemsimðxemÞ þ ncapsimxcap
  nfluesimxflue

where ncap and nem are the number of moles of the captured and emitted gases, respectively. The total and compositional mass balances are as follows.
nflue 1⁄4 ncap + nem (5)
xfluenflue 1⁄4 xcapncap + xemnem (6)
In this work, we assume that adsorption takes place under constant coal ue gas conditions, namely 40 C, 1 atm, and 14 : 86 (CO2 : N2), resulting in Wsep

1. Details on the calculation and the assumptions can be found in the ESI.† Next, we need to add the energy required to compress the captured gas to the typical pressure in transport and geological storage. Using a compressor model, as described in Section 2.2.1, results in a minimum compression work of Wcomp

Before we can combine minimal separation and compression work to allow for a reasonable comparison to parasitic energies, we need to convert the minimum separation work to the power plant's electricity output. Assuming heat as the source for the separation energy a maximum thermal efficiency of 40% (ref. 41) can be applied to obtain a total minimal energy requirement of 424.8 kJ kgCO2

convenience but using a low pressure steam turbine would result in a lower theoretical minimum, of course.
2.3 Thermodynamics of adsorption
For the computation of parasitic energy we need to determine several thermodynamic properties of the system. The most important ones are the (mixture) adsorption isotherms from which we can obtain the working capacities and the purity of captured CO2 as a function of desorption conditions. Pure component isotherms for N2 and CO2 were obtained by tting dual- or single-site Langmuir isotherms to experimental adsorption data if available, or to the data from molecular simulation. Langmuir isotherms with N sites are given by
si 1⁄4 N X
j1⁄41
kH; i; j pi
1 þ kH; i; j
ssat; i; j
pi
(7)
with si the loading at partial pressure pi, kH,i,j the Henry coefcient, and ssat,i,j the saturation loading of component i and corresponding adsorption site j. We assume that saturation loadings and heat of adsorption h are temperature independent. Hence, the temperature dependence of the Henry coefficients follows directly from the van't Hoff relation:
ln kH;i;jðT Þ 1⁄4 A  Dhi; j
RT (8)
We used two different models to predict the mixture adsorption based on the known pure component isotherms. The Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST)42 and the Competitive Langmuir Adsorption model were implemented into the parasitic energy metric to identify potential performance differences. The former is employed for almost all parasitic energies presented in this paper. A detailed comparison between these two models can be found in the ESI.† IAST is a commonly used method to predict the behavior of gas mixtures in the adsorbed phase and corresponding loadings can be determined by subsequently applying eqn (7). In contrast mixture isotherms for single site materials on the basis of the Competitive Langmuir model can be estimated by using

(9)
where indices 1 and 2 represent the ue gas components CO2 and N2, respectively. For dual-site adsorption, the stronger site was assumed to exclusively adsorb CO2, while N2 is only competing for the weaker CO2 site. The following equations show the dual-site and single-site approach for CO2 and N2 where indices 1 and 2 indicate the stronger and weaker site, respectively.

Furthermore, in the Competitive Adsorption model the single-site approach assumes equal saturation loadings for both ue gas components. The same applies for the dual-site adsorption, the only difference being that the loading of the weaker CO2 site equates the N2 loading. These assumptions are made for thermodynamic consistency.43 With the pure component isotherms at our disposal, the IAST or Competitive Adsorption model allows us to compute the equilibrium composition in the adsorbent as a function of temperature and pressure, from which we can obtain the working capacities of CO2 and N2 as well as the purities of capture and emission gases. Table 1 lists the specic heat capacities Cp for a selection of MOFs and zeolites. These are needed in eqn (2) but only known for a handful of materials. As can be seen from Table 1, it is important to note that the values of Cp are similar and generally range from Cp 1⁄4 0.761–1.21 J g1 K1. For all materials in this work, we therefore used a mean Cp 1⁄4 0.985 J g1 K1 and discussed resulting uncertainties in the ESI.† It is also assumed that adsorbed gases and temperature do not inuence the heat capacities. For the optimization process in TPSA, we xed the ranges of desorption pressure and temperatures to 0.01 atm < pdes < 3 atm and 333 K < Tdes < 473 K, respectively. As TSA operates under constant pressure conditions, the desorption conditions were set to pdes 1⁄4 1 atm (equals adsorption pressure) and 333 K < Tdes < 473 K. In contrast, PSA is characterized by a constant temperature and desorption conditions were kept at Tdes 1⁄4 333 K and 0.01 atm < pdes < 3 atm.
3 Material selection
We have selected ve different classes of porous materials for performance analysis via parasitic energy that have been reported in the recent literature due to their potential for carbon capture: zeolites,23 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs),36,48,49 cation exchanged zeolites (CEZs),50 porous polymer networks (PPNs),51,52 and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).20–22,34,51–64 MOFs and PPNs, in particular, exhibit improved adsorption properties65,66 and hence, might indicate promising performance in parasitic energy. MOFs stand out due to their nearly innite number of possible structures by varying metals and

framework components. We also include MOFs with an open metal site; the series of M-MOF-74, CuBTC, and CuBTTri,31,35,67–69 which exhibit even higher CO2 uptake capacities. These open metal sites arise from removing coordinated solvent molecules and are known to create preferential adsorption sites for CO2.58,70 In addition, the recent literature62–64 has highlighted two pyrazine based and hexauorosilicate anion bridged isostructural MOFs from the SIFSIX-3-M series as very promising candidates for CO2 removal, particularly for direct air capture. The class of PPNs, on the other hand, attracts attention by its widely open and accessible pores.52 Tetrahedral phenyl-based monomers form a diamondoid network which is suitable to introduce CO2-cohesive extra-framework molecules to increase the CO2 affinity.51,66 In this work, we particularly concentrate on PPN-6 based structures tethered with different polyamines. We also investigated the CCS performance of CEZs to determine the impact of varying the framework type and partially exchanging the containing cation. The two analyzed frameworks count to the Linde type A (NaA) and the Linde type X (NaX). The Nacations in the two framework types were partially exchanged by Mg- and Ca-cations. Additionally, we included a class denoted as hypothetical, containing materials which were theoretically predicted but are not known to be synthesized, yet. Several hypothetical MOF materials based on the familiar material MOF-5 (ref. 71) and hypothetical ZIF structures are part of this class. Fig. 3 shows a representative structure for each class of materials we studied in this work.
4 Carbon capture of flue gas from coal
In subsection 4.1, we calculate and discuss the parasitic energy for TPSA for carbon capture from a coal red power
plant. Subsection 4.2 studies the consequences of separate temperature and pressure swings on parasitic energy and working capacity. We conclude in subsection 4.3 by comparing our results to a selection of other metrics suggested in the literature.
4.1 Parasitic energy in TPSA
Fig. 4 shows the parasitic energy from a coal red power plant using an adsorption process for the materials in Section 3 as a function of their CO2 Henry coefficient (kH,CO2). It is interesting to compare these results with the corresponding parasitic energy of the currently applied MEA technology for coal ue gas which is estimated to be at 1060 kJ kgCO2
1 based on similar assumptions as our model.72 This value is about 300 kJ kgCO2
1 lower than the originally reported one which additionally considers energy losses caused by the equipment.41 In our parasitic energy calculation we also ignore these contributions. We see that there are quite a number of materials that have a parasitic energy below the current technology which is an important and encouraging result. Amongst them are most of the CEZs, open metal sites and both SIFSIX-3-M MOFs as well as the PPN-6 based structures. In the selection of materials in Table 2, Mg-MOF-74 stands out as the one with the lowest parasitic energy (727 kJ kgCO2
1). The amine functionalized MOF mmen-CuBTTri has a comparable parasitic energy of 752 kJ

and the desorption heat have to be considered in a real adsorption case in addition to the actual separation. Comparing the MOF's effective heating requirement (142 kJ kgCO2
1) and the minimal separation energy (67 kJ kgCO2
1, aer applying the thermal efficiency) shows that sensible and desorption heat account for approximately 80 kJ kgCO2
1. Hence, the main energy difference (z220 kJ kgCO2
1) results from the compression work which for both, the theoretical minimum and MgMOF-74, is based on the same model calculations with desorption pressures of 1 atm and 0.1 atm, respectively. A desorption pressure difference of only one order of magnitude thus affects the compression work signicantly. We also compared the parasitic energies of our material selection to an extensive screening of a library of zeolites which consists of experimentally known and theoretically predicted (hypothetical) zeolites.72 The dashed line in Fig. 4 indicates the lowest parasitic energy of all zeolite materials with a given CO2 Henry coefficient. It highlights the existence of an optimal
range of Henry coefficients (104 to 102 mol kg1 Pa1). Lower Henry coefficients result in lower working capacities, and higher coefficients require too much energy in the regeneration step.72 The experimental structures follow the same trends. Most of the ZIFs and hypothetical MOFs populate the low Henry coefficient region, and hence have a relatively high parasitic energy. Materials with a very high Henry coefficient (mainly amine appended PPNs and SIFSIX-3-Cu) still exhibit comparably low parasitic energies, but already are precursors to a steadily increasing trend. The region of optimal Henry coefficients includes CEZs and open metal site MOFs. Materials with parasitic energies of more than 2000 kJ kgCO2
1 mainly include the hypothetical structures, but also some of the MOFs (i.e., UMCM-1, MOF-177), PPNs (i.e., PPN-4 and PPN-6), and ZIF-8. Even though all these structures exhibit high surface areas and porosities they are expected to perform less in CCS due to their low Henry coefficients. Particularly, ZIF-8 prefers the adsorption of N2 over CO2 which is why an extremely high parasitic energy of 20 000 kJ kgCO2
1 is predicted for it. It is interesting to investigate the effect of changes in parasitic energy in the MOF-74 series by varying the metal center. Looking at Mg, Zn, Co, and Ni as metal centers the corresponding MOFs turn out to rank in the order Mg-MOF-74 < Zn-MOF-74 < Co-MOF-74 < Ni-MOF-74. The exceptional performance of Mg-MOF-74 by up to hundreds of kilojoules traces back to its higher density of open metal sites.35 For the PPN-6 family we observed that all functionalized PPN-6 materials perform signicantly better in parasitic energy than bare PPN-6. In the case of sulfonic functional groups, the sulfonic acid graed PPN-6 is outperformed by its lithium salt. Even lower parasitic energies can be obtained by controlling the amine functionalizing of PPN-6 with respect to the number of amine groups and chain length:
PPN-6-CH2TETA < PPN-6-CH2TAEA < PPN-6-CH2DETA.
Comparison of different CEZ structures shows that changing the cation has a large effect on the Henry coefficient, but causes little change in the parasitic energy. In general, the Linde type X materials perform slightly better than the Linde type A structures with NaX leading the ranking. All zeolites in this range and their respective rank are listed in Table 2. It is instructive to see how the separation and compression contribute to the parasitic energy. Fig. 5 shows the fraction the compression energy contributes to the total parasitic energy. For the MEA process the compression costs contribute 32%. This comparably low contribution results mainly from the predominating heating requirement to produce pure CO2 for storage by removing the water content. The required compression work is also lower due to an initial CO2 pressure of 1–2 atm. In comparison, the compression contribution of our best materials ranges between 65 and 85% as CO2 gas from below 1 atm needs to be compressed up to 150 bar. For the materials like ZIF-8 and the hypothetical HMOF-96 with high parasitic energies (>10 000 kJ kgCO2
1), the share of compression work can be as much as 90%. These materials adsorb preferentially N2

which results in higher compression requirements due to low CO2 purities.
4.2 Parasitic energy in PSA vs. TSA
In the previous section we optimized the parasitic energy using a hybrid pressure swing/temperature swing process, i.e. the working capacity of a material can be optimized by changing both the temperature and pressure at which regeneration takes place. One does not always have the possibility to carry out such a hybrid scheme and it is therefore interesting to look at the parasitic energy if only TSA or PSA is applied. Fig. 6 shows the parasitic energy results for capturing CO2 from coal ue gas depending on the Henry coefficient at 300 K using TSA and PSA as regeneration strategies. The respective operating conditions are outlined in subsection 2.3. Fig. 6 suggests that regenerating nano-porous materials using the PSA strategy always leads to lower energy loads compared to TSA. In the latter, the emphasis is placed on optimizing the heating energy which is directly linked to the working capacity. Compression costs, however, are almost steady due to the xed desorption pressure conditions. Unlike TSA, PSA is designed to optimize the compression requirements for a given working capacity due to the xed desorption temperature conditions. For materials with a low Henry coefficient (106 to 104 mol kg1 Pa1) the working capacity is small. This requires one to heat up the entire sorbent to relatively high temperatures to even enable the capture of a small amount of CO2 resulting in very high heating costs in TSA. In a PSA, a small working capacity does not have a dramatic effect on the parasitic energy as the compression cost is the predominating and a very sensitive energy requirement (see subsection 4.1). However, applying PSA does increase the capital costs due to a higher sorbent demand. Table 3 highlights these observations along with the total parasitic energies for materials with low and high Henry
coefficients. The parasitic energies of both regeneration strategies become comparable for materials with a large Henry coefficient while generally tending to lower parasitic energies in PSA. The dotted line in Fig. 6 compares TSA and PSA with the optimal TPSA results. The close agreement with the PSA results shows that the whole process tends to favor the use of PSA. In our metric, the working capacity plays an important role in the TSA's but less in the PSA's parasitic energies. However, a low working capacity inuences the capital costs which mandates a separate look at the working capacity. Fig. 7 shows a high working capacity for the optimal materials in both strategies. Interestingly, in the high Henry coefficient region, TSA exhibits higher worker capacities and higher parasitic energies. This gure also illustrates the limitation of our metric: we may identify a material that is interesting from an operation cost but not from a capital cost point of view. Moreover, our metric does not consider any transport restrictions. For instance, we assume that adsorption and desorption of CO2 happen instantaneously. However, two materials with identical thermodynamic properties will result in identical parasitic energies. If it takes twice as

long to complete a full capturing cycle, the capital costs of the material that takes longer might be twice as high due to the required increase in adsorbers to keep up with the ue gas ux of the power plant.
4.3 Comparison of parasitic energy to other metrics
Bae et al. investigated 25 different materials to evaluate their suitability for capturing CO2 from ue gas in a PSA process.31 In their work, they proposed the optimization of the following adsorbent evaluation criteria to examine and rank the performance of the materials under the regeneration conditions Tads/des 1⁄4 298 K, pads 1⁄4 1 bar, pdes 1⁄4 0.1 bar and a CO2 : N2 gas composition of 90 : 10.  CO2 uptake ðqads

 CO2 heat of adsorption DhCO2 Note that the sorbent selection parameter is a combination of two separate criteria. The rst part expresses the importance of the selectivities during adsorption and desorption.74 The second term represents the fraction of the working capacities.75,76 Both criteria together are used to facilitate the performance assessment and to improve the classication of the materials.31 A recent perspective30 on MOFs for CO2 capture and separation by Zhang et al. also highlighted four of the above mentioned criteria, namely capacity, selectivity, regeneration, and heat of adsorption, as crucial ones to evaluate solid adsorbents for use in the CO2 capture and separation process. As the parasitic energy is a weighted overall property, it is instructive to see how the above criteria contribute to the parasitic energy. Unlike Bae et al., we considered a ue gas
composition of 14 : 86 (CO2 : N2) under adsorption conditions of Tads 1⁄4 313 K and pads 1⁄4 1 atm. For regeneration, the capture gas composition was set to 99 : 1 (CO2 : N2) with desorption conditions (Tdes and pdes) optimized according to the minimal parasitic energy. The same conditions were applied for the calculation of the evaluation criteria. Both, parasitic energy and the proposed evaluation criteria are based on the competitive Langmuir model to avoid limitations of IAST at very high differences in Henry coefficients of adsorbed components. Fig. 8 compares our parasitic energy with different criteria. Fig. 8-a depicts the parasitic energy as a function of the CO2 uptake. Small CO2 uptakes require the entire column to be brought to desorption conditions which causes high parasitic energies with only a small amount of CO2 being removed. We see a monotonic decrease of the parasitic energy towards higher CO2 uptakes. However, for materials with a CO2 uptake higher than 0.7 mol kg1, the parasitic energy does not decrease further. Materials with a very high uptake could be more difficult to regenerate which is why the reduction in parasitic energy with increasing CO2 uptake is compensated by increasing regeneration costs. A similar trend is observed for the CO2 selectivity in Fig. 8-b. Materials with a higher selectivity will have a lower parasitic energy. The higher the selectivity, the lower the compression costs for the captured gas as it will contain less N2. However, if the selectivity increases above 102, the gain in selectivity is compensated by higher regeneration costs. As the working capacity is closely related to the maximum uptake, we observe a similar trend in Fig. 8-c: the parasitic energy decreases with increasing working capacity but above a capacity of (0.7 mol kg1) the parasitic energy does not improve further. Fig. 8-d presents the parasitic energy dependency on material regenerability. Materials with low parasitic energy requirements regenerate worse than materials with high parasitic energies. Materials below the MEA performance line feature regenerabilities of 15–70%, whereas materials above it regenerate beyond 80%. Regenerability is dened as the fraction of working capacity (equivalent to produced amount of CO2) and uptake (actually captured amount of CO2). Materials with only a few, weak or not selective binding sites regenerate easily, i.e. close to 100%, since little CO2 was adsorbed to start with and almost all of it desorbed. In contrast, materials with low parasitic energies rstly exhibit strong or highly selective binding sites and secondly possess a lot of them. Thus, low regenerability denotes that a relatively small amount of CO2 was produced compared to the present binding sites. Clearly, regenerability is not a criterion which can be used in isolation. Fig. 8-e shows the parasitic energy as a function of the sorbent selection parameter. Similar to uptake and working capacity, the results bear resemblance to the selectivity dependence in plot Fig. 8-b. Both criteria yield the same ranking results, merely the sorbent selection parameter axis seems to be stretched compared to selectivity. The sorbent selection parameter can be expressed by the selectivity with a nonconstant exponent. Hence, this criterion magnies selectivity differences between materials.

The last plot in Fig. 8 displays the correlation between parasitic energy and the CO2 heat of adsorption. In general, approaching more negative heat of adsorption values result in lower, more promising parasitic energies. Materials possessing Dh values higher than about 25 kJ mol1 are generally located above the current amine-scrubbing performance line. Whereas
Dh values lower than about 30 kJ mol1 mostly lead to well performing materials. Fig. 8-f, however, also does not highlight any optimum heat of adsorption which would justify optimizing this criterion. Hence, Dh as a single criterion is likewise not suited to determine promising materials but serves as an indicator for low parasitic energies.

Summarizing the results gathered from Fig. 8 yields the following conclusions. Only four of the six presented evaluation criteria are real independent criteria. Applying the criteria individually does give important insights but does not reveal the optimal material. The combination of the proposed evaluation criteria is therefore a necessity as also pointed out by Bae et al.31
5 Carbon capture at low concentrations
The CO2 concentration in the exhaust gases of power plants can be variable. Herein, it is interesting to see how the selection of the optimal material depends on the source of the ue gas. In this section, we look at carbon capture from natural gas and capture directly from air.
5.1 Carbon capture of natural gas
We can also screen the different materials to capture carbon from ue gas of a natural gas red power plant. For a typical gas red power plant the CO2 concentration in ue gas is ca. 4%. Fig. 9 shows the parasitic energy results for natural gas as a function of the CO2 Henry coefficient (kH,CO2) at 300 K. The shape of the curve is similar to the one for ue gas of a coal red power plant which was shown in subsection 4.1. However, the optimal Henry coefficient region is shied to higher values and now at 103 to 101 mol kg1 Pa1 compared to 104 to 102 mol kg1 Pa1 for coal ue gas. Furthermore, Fig. 9 shows that the parasitic energies for ue gas of natural gas are higher compared to results predicted for a coal-red power plant. As the CO2 concentration in ue gas from natural gas is lower compared to ue gas from coal, a stronger interaction with CO2 is needed to reach the same working capacities. However, a stronger CO2 interaction also implies that the regeneration costs will increase. Consequently, the lowest
reached parasitic energies are higher than in the case of coal. For very high Henry coefficient values, though, the materials will be close to saturation, and the working capacity will hence be less sensitive to the initial CO2 concentration in the ue gas. This results in a similar parasitic energy for ue gas from natural gas and coal. In our screening, the best material for natural gas carbon capture is the amine-functionalized PPN-6-CH2TETA with a parasitic energy of 806.53 kJ kgCO2
1. For coal we found MgMOF-74 to be the best performing material. For natural gas, however, this MOF exhibits a parasitic energy of 958.68 kJ
kgCO2
1 which is even higher than the other analyzed aminefunctionalized PPN-6 materials and the zinc centered SIFSIX-3M (PPN-6-CH2TAEA < PPN-6-CH2DETA < SIFSIX-3-Zn < MgMOF-74). A selection of materials with corresponding parasitic energies is shown in Table 4. In general, the parasitic energy results indicate that applying CCS on natural gas based ue gas puts a higher additional energy load per kg captured CO2 on a power plant than coal ue gas. This does not imply that the total energy loss of carbon capture for natural gas is also higher. Natural gas red power plants produce less carbon for the same electricity output.77 Compared to coal, natural gas is known to produce twice as much electricity based on the amount of CO2 produced (1842 kW h per tcoal and 127 kW h per Mcfnatural gas, respectively).78 Based on these values provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration we computed the total energy loss by parasitic energy for both gas compositions (see ESI†). Fig. 10 illustrates the energy loss in terms of electricity caused by applying CCS in coal and natural gas power plants as function of the parasitic energy requirement on a material-by-material basis. Even though we can nd materials for carbon capture from coal red power plants with a lower parasitic energy compared to natural gas ue gas, the overall loss in electric energy for natural gas is smaller (10–20%) compared to coal (20–30%).
5.2 Carbon capture directly from air
Until now, we have studied the parasitic energy of CCS with respect to the capture of CO2 at its place of origin in the power plant. In the following, we instead look into CO2 capture directly from air. We ask whether this could provide a valuable alternative for the power plant to make up for its CO2 emissions by

“re-capturing” the same amount from the atmosphere.79 A CCS unit operated in this manner would also be powered by the heat and electricity from the power plant, of course. Fig. 11 shows the parasitic energy of direct air capture as a function of the Henry coefficient of CO2 at 300 K and compares it to those of coal and natural gas. In this calculation, we assumed an average CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of 400 ppm.79 We see that the optimal materials have the highest Henry coefficients which are consistent with the trend we saw for natural gas. Moreover, the effect of the ue gas composition on the parasitic energy becomes less important for these high Henry coefficients as the results steadily approach the coal and natural gas values. The best performing material for direct air capture is the amine-functionalized PPN-6-CH2DETA with a parasitic energy of 1215 kJ kgCO2
1 which corresponds to an electricity loss of
33% in a coal red power plant. This value is almost twice as high as the result for the corresponding optimal material for coal ue gas capture (727 kJ kgCO2
1, 20% electricity loss). In comparison to natural gas, the series of amine-functionalized PPN-6 materials has inverted the performance order (PPN-6-CH2DETA < PPN-6-CH2TAEA < PPN-6-CH2TETA). An identical behavior is also observed in the series of SIFSIX-3-M. In coal and natural gas separation, SIFSIX-3-Zn outperforms SIFSIX-3-Cu. For direct air capture, however, SIFSIX-3-Cu was identied as the second best performing material within all materials under investigation (1617 kJ kgCO2
1). Thus, SIFSIX-3-Cu is well suited for this kind of separation process as also highlighted by Shekhah et al. While the parasitic energies of the above PPN and SIFSIX-3-M classes are relatively close to each other, the value of Mg-MOF-74, the best performing material for coal ue gas separation, is already an order of magnitude larger (16 MJ kgCO2
1). The selection of materials with corresponding parasitic energies is shown in Table 5. Fig. 11 also shows that the optimal Henry coefficient region is not reached by the materials we have studied. Materials with even higher Henry coefficients might give lower parasitic energies closer to the results of coal and natural gas.
6 Conclusions and outlook
We have predicted the performance for over 60 synthesized and hypothetical nano-porous materials on the basis of experimental and simulated data using the new approach of parasitic energy. Parasitic energy has identied Mg-MOF-74, PPN-6-CH2TETA, and PPN-6-CH2DETA as the most promising materials for CCS in coal, natural gas, and direct air capture, respectively. The low CO2 concentrations in the latter two always result in higher parasitic energies compared to coal. Despite the increased energy requirements, natural gas, however, produces three times more electricity which yields an overall smaller electricity loss. Our work also revealed that implementing different regeneration strategies affects the parasitic energy predictions enormously. All materials exhibit higher parasitic energy values when applying TSA for desorption, while PSA and TPSA result in approximately identical low parasitic energy predictions. Additionally, we compared the concept of parasitic energy to the theoretical minimal energy penalty for simply separating an ideal gas

mixture and also to other proposed evaluation criteria to evaluate their ability to rank materials and to point out prediction differences. The results have shown that parasitic energy is a suitable metric to evaluate materials for CCS without further consideration of additional criteria. Parasitic energy not only includes the energy estimation for the compression process which is completely neglected in other ranking methods and plays a crucial part in the total energy penalty, but also combines several essential thermodynamic properties. Consequently, the parasitic energy model is a well suited metric for high-throughput screening of large databases. Quite remarkably, none of the various experimental structures perform better in parasitic energy than the according prediction by the best zeolite structures (dashed line in Fig. 4). This observation is probably related to the creation and amount of binding sites regardless of the specic material class. The best materials not only exhibit the maximum number of sites best suited for CO2 adsorption, but also a similar minimum number of material atoms needed to create an optimal binding site. The minimum volume required for a single CO2 adsorption is dened by the CO2 molecule and the minimal number of atoms for the binding site. As this volume represents the minimum involved in a CCS process we do not expect materials to perform better than the zeolite line. To give chemists and material scientists guidelines in the pursuit of new, more efficient nano-porous materials for CCS on the basis of parasitic energy, we conclude that selectively improving a particular material property does not ensure a superior performance in terms of energetic costs. Instead, a careful consideration of the interplay between various materials properties (e.g., uptake, selectivity, working capacity, and regeneration) can potentially lead to lower parasitic energies. Note that the working capacity reached in a PSA process is of less importance compared to the selectivity, uptake, and consequently Henry coefficient (see Section 4.2). We anticipate that an additional reduction of the energy cost can be achieved at least for natural gas separation and direct air capture. For coal, we are, however, not expecting any further signicant improvements as pointed out in the previous paragraph. It should be noted, that the approach of parasitic energy only provides the energy requirement which is needed to capture one kilogram of CO2 and does not give information on the total amount of captured CO2. Furthermore, no approximation on the investment costs for the adsorbents or retrotting the facilities is included. It also needs to be mentioned that the shown results represent the material evaluation for CCS on the basis of a two-component ue gas, merely considering CO2 and N2. In reality, power plant ue gas exhibits several additional components, like SOx, NOx, and water in signicant amounts (5–15 vol%).80 Water is known to compete strongly for the CO2 adsorption sites.81–85 This characteristic could modify the current material ranking completely. Hence, further investigations need to be conducted to get a more reliable parasitic energy prediction for real ue gas conditions.
