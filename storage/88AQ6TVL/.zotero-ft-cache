ABSTRACT: The tapered geometry of nanopipettes offers a unique perspective on protein transport through nanopores since both a gradual and fast confinement are possible depending on the translocation direction. The protein capture rate, unfolding, speed of translocation, and clogging probability are studied by toggling the LiCl concentration between 2 and 4 M. Interestingly, the proteins in this study could be transported with or against electrophoresis and offer vastly different attributes of sensing. Herein, a ruleset for studying proteins is developed that prevents irreversible pore clogging and yields upward of >100,000 events/ nanopore. The extended duration of experiments further revealed that the capture rate takes ∼2 h to reach a steady state, emphasizing the importance of reaching equilibrated transport for studying the energetics and kinetics of protein transport (i.e., diffusion vs barrier-limited). Even in the equilibrated transport state, improper lowpass filtering was shown to distort the classification of diffusion-limited vs barrier-limited transport. Finally, electric-field-induced protein unfolding was found to be most prominent in electroosmotic-dominant transport, whereas electrophoretic-dominant events show no evidence of unfolding. Thus, our findings showcase the optimal conditions for protein translocations and the impact on studying protein unfolding, transporting energetics, and acquiring high bandwidth data.
1. INTRODUCTION
Nanopores are a sensor class capable of delivering single molecule-level information at an unprecedented throughput, at a fraction of the cost compared to most contemporary analytical methods, and with prospects as far-reaching as
protein and DNA sequencing.1,2 The application scope of nanopores is vast and spans a range of biomolecules and
bioparticles.3−9 Fast protein translocations often challenge the bandwidth of conventional electronics (typically ≤100 kHz),
leading to attenuated electrical readouts.10 Advancements in electronics have led to more compact high bandwidth instruments that are capable of capturing sub-microsecond
scale events.11−13 However, high open-pore noise precludes the application of such high bandwidth amplifiers with most membrane materials. Optimizing the sensing conditions to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) would pave the way for the widespread adoption of high bandwidth acquisition
approaches.14 A rich blend of approaches to slow down the translocation speed of analytes have been proposed over the
years, including, but not limited to, pressure opposition,15
surface coating and anchoring, and6,16 surface capturing. These are well complemented by efforts for noise reduction through
membrane coatings (e.g., PDMS),17 surface passivation,18 low
noise materials (e.g., quartz),19 and amplifiers (e.g., CMOS
preamplifiers).11 As such, understanding the intricate links of protein translocation characteristics (e.g., SNR, translocation speed) with chemical (e.g., solution and pore surface and membrane chemistry), physical (e.g., pore diameter, sensing
length), and electronic (e.g., bandwidth) conditions are imperative to achieve desirable sensing conditions for proteins. Compared to the work performed with DNA, the protein footprint in nanopipette studies is meager. A major hurdle with proteins is the nonspecific adsorption leading to irreversible pore clogging, which is often more profound than that observed with DNA. However, in some instances, transient interactions based on pore surface−protein affinity play a key role in the detection of events, which is beneficial, unlike irreversible pore clogging, where the interaction of the pore surface and the analyte is detrimental to further operation of
the pore.20 Pore clogging by the analyte is often accepted as part of nanopore experiments, which precludes the operation of pores over longer periods and the collection of large amounts of data (i.e., a few hundred to a few thousand events instead of tens of thousands of events). Circumventing pore clogging is very critical for nanopores to venture into the commercial space since the pore should be open for business rather than prematurely succumbing to analyte clogging. Circumventing pore clogging by the analyte is one aspect that will be discussed in this work. For a molecule to

translocate across a nanopore, it should (i) diffuse from the bulk to the capture zone, (ii) funnel to the pore entrance through drift-dominant transport, and (iii) overcome energetic barriers (e.g., entropic and electrostatic). Thus, the translocation process can either be diffusion-limited or barrierlimited. The former is typically characterized using the classical Smoluchowski theory, while the latter with the van’t Hoff−
Arrhenius law.9,21 The diffusion-limited capture rate is defined
as C = r V

, where r, μ, V, and l are the pore radius,

rate is defined as = | |

V0
represents the
barrier reduction factor due to the applied voltage. Thus, the capture rate and applied voltage share an exponential relationship in the barrier-limited transport regime. Another important aspect of protein translocations (or any other analyte) is the SNR. Proteins are often translocated in the electrophoretic direction, and it is not uncommon to see the use of high salt conditions mainly due to the poor SNR associated with protein translocations under low salt conditions. A negatively charged protein translocating through a negatively charged pore material (e.g., quartz, silicon nitride) has the added advantage of having opposed electrophoretic and electroosmotic forces, which would slow down the translocation speed of the protein. One way to increase the
SNR would be to use a smaller pore. However, this increases the irreversible sticking probability, rendering the pore futile for further use. As shown later, the tapered geometry of nanopipettes provides a solution to this where we observed pipette to bath transport (i.e., forward translocations) being less prone to clogging compared to bath to pipette transport (i.e., backward translocations). The geometry may be preventing/discouraging the cotranslocation of proteins in the forward direction, whereas such constraints are not present in the backward direction (analogous to planar nanopore configuration). Thus, the forward direction permits the use of smaller pores to improve the SNR and, by extension, as shown in the manuscript, allows the maximum available lowpass filter (LPF) of the Axopatch 200B (i.e., 100 kHz) to be used to detect protein translocations (with four different proteins) across a broad range of voltages (i.e., ±300 to ±1000 mV). We used the holo-form of the human serum transferrin (hSTf) as the core model protein in this study. It is a blood glycoprotein protein with a molar mass of ∼80 kDa and a pI of
∼5.1−5.5, which is critical for iron transport.22 The transport properties of hSTf with planar nanopores are well-charac
terized,14,23−25 thus providing a frame of reference when required. In this study, we investigated a wide range of tunable parameters using nanopipettes to showcase the dependence of the transport properties (e.g., SNR, translocation time, and mode of transport (i.e., electroosmosis (EO) or electrophoresis (EP) dominant)) and their implications on protein structure (i.e., voltage-driven unfolding). More broadly, the nanopipette size (i.e., note that nanopipette/pore size hereafter refers to the tip diameter of the nanopipette), solution chemistry, and transport direction were investigated broadly with four proteins. More specifically, 22 different pore diameters spanning ∼9 to ∼30 nm in the EO realm (2 M LiCl), 22

different pore sizes spanning ∼7 to ∼33 nm in the EP realm (4 M LiCl), and 8 different voltages in most instances (±300 to ±1000 mV in ±100 mV increments) were investigated encompassing ∼3 million protein events. The transport direction dependence was investigated using four proteins: hSTf, bovine serum albumin (BSA), ferritin, and hemoglobin. The isoelectric points for BSA, hemoglobin (bovine), and ferritin are reported to be ∼4.5, ∼7.1, and ∼5.4−5.5, respectively. As mentioned previously, the forward direction was found to be more resilient against analyte clogging (often producing >20,000 events/pipette and even >100,000 events/ pipette), while the backward direction more often leads to irreversible clogging. Furthermore, smaller pore sizes (<2× the diameter of proteins) can be used with relative ease in the forward direction, which improves volumetric occlusion by the protein, confinement, and, by extension, SNR enabling high bandwidth recordings crucial to minimize temporal attenuation of electrical readouts. Thus, these findings are broadly beneficial to exploring protein sensing applications.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Nanopipette Fabrication. Quartz capillaries (QF10070-7.5, Sutter Instruments) were first plasma cleaned (Harrick Plasma PDC32G) for 5 min at high power. The nanopipettes were then fabricated using a Sutter P-2000 CO2 laser puller with the following settings: Heat of 630, Fil of 4, Velocity of 61, and Delay of 130. The pull was varied from 125−220 to tune the final tip diameter of the nanopipette (see Figure 1 and SI Figure S1 for the relationship of pull vs pore diameter). The electrolyte of interest is then filled using microfills (World 524 Precision Instrument MicroFil-MF34G-5). The microfill is inserted all the way into the pulled capillary and slowly pulled out as the pipette is filled with the electrolyte. This minimizes the possibility of air bubble formation during the filling process. The nanopipettes pulled using filament-free capillaries are difficult to fill; hence, we used capillaries with the filament for this study. To further ensure proper pore-wetting, a voltage bias (typically 200 or 1000 mV) opposite to that used for translocation experiments is applied until the open-pore current stabilizes. A current−voltage (I−V) curve is then taken, and the nanopipette tip diameter (dp) is estimated using

where G, K, Dp, dp, and L are the open-pore conductance, the conductivity of the electrolyte, the base diameter, the tip diameter, and sensing length, respectively. The dp would often be referred to as the pore diameter in this paper (vide infra), while it explicitly refers to the tip diameter of the nanopipette.
2.2. Biomolecule Preparation. Stock solutions of hSTf were prepared by dissolving the as-supplied product (616397, SigmaAldrich) in 1 mM KHCO3 (P235, Fisher Scientific). It was then added to the electrolyte to a final concentration of ∼600 nM. Hemoglobin (J63838.06, Alfa Aesar) was prepared by dissolving the as-supplied product in water. BSA (B9000S, New England Biolabs) and ferritin (S6272, MP Biomedicals) were used as supplied with appropriate dilutions. All stock solutions except BSA were stored at 4°C (BSA was stored at −20°C). 2.3. Electrolyte Preparation. LiCl (310468, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ultrapure water and buffered with 10 mM tris−EDTA (BP2475, Fisher Scientific). The pH was adjusted by adding concentrated drops of HCl (SA48-1, Fischer Scientific) or KOH (LC192402, LabChem) and measured using an Accumet AB200 pH meter.
2.4. Electrical Measurements. Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices LLC) connected to a Digidata 1550B (Molecular Devices LLC) was used for all measurements. Signals were filtered using the
inbuilt Bessel lowpass filter of the Axopatch 200B (10 or 100 kHz) and acquired at 250 kHz (500 kHz in the case of 100 kHz lowpass filter) using the digitizer. Data were then extracted using the EventPro

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Equilibration of Protein Transport and Bandwidth Limitations. 3.1.1. Relationship between Pull, Pore Conductance, and Inner Capillary Diameter. Nanopipettes were fabricated conveniently through laser pulling, and the relationship between pull and G/K is shown in Figure 1c for quartz capillaries with an internal diameter (ID) of 0.7 mm. Looking at the pull vs G/K plots corresponding to 0.7 mm ID (Figure 1c) and 0.5 mm ID (Figure S1), a given pull produces a smaller pore with a smaller ID capillary. This is in good agreement with the observations of Sun et al., where pores as
small as ∼5 nm were fabricated with 0.3 mm ID capillaries.28 3.1.2. Electroosmosis, Electrophoresis, and SNR. All protein translocation experiments were carried out using the LiCl electrolyte, and the translocations were in the EO direction with 2 M LiCl, whereas they were in the EP direction with 4 M LiCl. Since both the quartz pore surface and the protein (hSTf) are net-negatively charged at the operational pH (∼8), the EO and EP forces would be opposing at any given voltage bias. When hSTf is added to the pipette and a voltage bias is applied to the same side, the sign of the voltage bias that leads to translocations provides insight into the dominant translocation mechanism. For example, when a negative potential is applied, the EP force imparted on the protein is from the pipette to the bath side, while the EO is from the bath to the pipette side. Thus, for translocations to be feasible, EP should dominate EO. On the other hand, when a positive voltage bias is applied, the directions of EP and EO would reverse, and EO should dominate EP for translocations to happen. Since hSTf translocates under a positive bias in 2 M LiCl, EO is dominant over EP, and in 4 M LiCl, since hSTf translocates under a negative bias, EP is dominant over EO.
Analogous to the arguments of Sha et al.,29 the EO flow opposing the translocation direction of a charged particle could effectively decrease the ion concentration inside the nanopore by preventing the ion introduction through the double layer of the charged particle. This could consequently lead to deeper current blockades. Furthermore, looking at the work of Saharia et al., it is clear that the signal magnitude decreases with decreasing salt concentration (in the EP-dominant realm) and then starts to increase as the transport mechanism switches to
the EO direction.23 For EP-dominant translocations, 4 M LiCl was used since it is the ubiquitously reported highest LiCl concentration. For EO-dominant transport, while it is possible to use concentrations lower than 2 M LiCl, open-pore current can become unstable at lower electrolyte conditions. For the model protein hSTf, EO-dominant transport was preferred due to the comparatively poor SNR of EP-dominant transport, especially in larger pores, as shown in Figure 1d (dp ∼ 20 nm). Moreover, the higher SNR associated with the EO transport conditions allows hSTf to be probed over a wide range of pore sizes compared to EP transport conditions.
3.1.3. CR−V and Dynamic Equilibrium of Proteins. The capture rate vs voltage (CR−V) curves provide insight into the transport mechanism with a linear relationship indicating diffusion-limited transport and an exponential relationship
indicating barrier-limited transport (vide supra).21,23 We have observed that proteins could take considerable time (some

times as much as ∼2 h) to reach a dynamic equilibrium where the slope of the CR−V curves (i.e., referred to as sensitivity hereafter) would not change appreciably with each sweep (Figure 2a,b). Nonequilibrated protein runs could severely distort the final output. For example, as seen in Figure 2a, the initial sweep resembles a scenario where events are missed at higher applied voltages due to fast protein translocations. However, further data acquisition shows that this is merely due to the proteins not achieving the before-mentioned dynamic equilibrium within the nanopipette, possibly due to diffusion processes or electrostatic repulsion inside the taper. Thus, rather than relying on a single sweep, in this study, we performed multiple CR−V sweeps until a steady state was reached, and the average of the steady-state condition was then treated as the final sensitivity for a given condition (Figure 2b). Moreover, all subsequent analysis is based on these equilibrated sweeps. During the entire lifetime of the pore, the open-pore current in each voltage was monitored very closely (during each voltage sweep). Experiments were terminated if a significant decrease in the open-pore current
was seen for any of the applied voltages as it could (i) indicate protein adsorption onto the nanopore and (ii) alter EO flow characteristics of the pore. More recently, Saharia et al. observed a continuous increase in CR over time with DNA translocation experiments conducted over several hours using planar silicon nitride
nanopores.30 Albeit the difference in the analyte (protein vs DNA) and the pore geometry (cylindrical vs conical), their observation of CR not reaching a steady-state value agrees strongly with our findings concerning CR with time where we see sensitivity (i.e., the slope of the CR−V curve) taking a considerable time to reach a steady-state value. Since molecules have to diffuse from the bulk into the capture radius before undergoing drift-dominant transport, a dynamic equilibrium may exist in the outer boundary of the capture radius

steady state, the protein concentration in the capture radius is expected to increase over time (due to the supply of proteins from the bulk). Once the above equilibrium reaches a (dynamic) steady state, according to Le Chatelier’s principle, the depletion of proteins in the capture zone will be countered by the supply of proteins from the bulk. It is unlikely that the protein molecules in the bulk would see a significant depletion/change since the initial protein concentration in the bulk is ∼600 nM (∼2 × 1014 molecules) and the highest number of events recorded in this study from a single nanopipette is slightly over 300,000. To rationalize the time taken to reach the dynamic steady-state condition, one could argue that the proteins might be undergoing a conformational change in the electrolyte, and it could be contributing to the significant equilibration time. However, as evident by the data provided in SI Section 2 (Tables S1−S4), it is clear that there is very little change in the ΔI and the Δt characteristics of the pre- and post-equilibrium runs, which could rule out any significant contributions from the dynamic conformational changes of the protein to the equilibration time. Another possibility is that there is an equilibration time associated with the wetting characteristics of the nanopipette. However, we see no significant change in the open-pore current values of the nanopipettes over time, which suggests that the wetting characteristics of the nanopipette do not appreciably change over time. Furthermore, since the capture rate increases with the increasing pore diameter, the stable open-pore current with time rules out any significant change in the tip diameter of the
nanopipette that could cause a change in the sensitivity (i.e., the slope of the CR−V curve) with time. Using the same rationale, the stable open-pore current over time suggests that there is insignificant protein adsorption to the nanopipette (at least in the sensing zone region). The glass surface within the tapered region of the nanopipette, however, is more likely to interact with the proteins in solution since electrophoresis is weaker and Brownian motion dominates (e.g., leading to more protein-glass bumping events). As the taper shrinks from millimeter-scale to nanometer-scale, the surface area-to-volume ratio increases, which could lead to the slow saturation of the glass walls with adsorbed proteins, followed by a slow increase in protein concentration over time, which would lead to capture rate dynamics seen in Figure 2b.
3.1.4. Sensitivity, Pore Size, and Bandwidth Limitations. We then investigated the transport properties and structural implications across a broad range of pore sizes. The sensitivity with dp is shown in Figure 2c. We broadly categorized the pores into four zones�zone 1 (red region), zone 2 (blue region), zone 3 (yellow region), and zone 4 (green region)� based on major breakpoints of sensitivity with dp. Zone 2 is more conventionally anticipated, where sensitivity decreases with decreasing pore size due to the proportional relationship
between capture radius and pore size.31,32 However, counterintuitively, an increase in sensitivity (with decreasing dp) was seen in zone 1. This is thought to be due to the voltagemediated unfolding seen with proteins, which would transform the proteins from their native globular state to a more linear

All experiments were performed at pH ∼ 8 with hSTf as the analyte.

state. An intricate interplay of the hydrodynamic drag forces, structural properties, and EO flow profiles could be responsible for the observed sensitivity pattern in this zone (i.e., zone 1). Pores in zone 1 also produced the highest current drops. This was expected because the volume occlusion with respect to the size of the pore is highest in this region. The electrical readouts from zone 1 were of sufficient SNR to be filtered using the highest available LPF setting of the Axopatch 200B (i.e., 100 kHz), and a representative trace corresponding to +300 to +1000 mV from an ∼9 nm pore is shown in Figure 2d (shown more later in the paper). The ability to reach higher bandwidth settings is important since the bandwidth governs the rise time of the filter and, by extension, whether a signal is attenuated or not. The rise time of the LPF is given by Tr = 0.35/fc, where fc is the cutoff frequency of the LPF, with events faster than 2Tr (i.e., translocation time <2Tr) being attenuated. For the more ubiquitous LPF setting (i.e., 10 kHz), 2Tr is ∼70 μs (the full width half-maximum (FWMH) approach allows to reach calculated durations as low as ∼40 μs with reasonable
errors).23,27,33 For the 100 kHz LP filter (bandwidth only reaches 70 kHz in the resistive-feedback mode of the Axopatch
200B),14 the theoretical 2Tr is ∼10 μs (SI Figure S3). The peak translocation time (i.e., τp, see SI Section 2 under Fitting of Δt Profiles for the definition) corresponding to the events collected in Figure 2d fall above the attenuation limit of the 100 kHz LP filter (Figure 2e). However, upon filtering with the 10 kHz LPF, we see that the τp for all voltages are within the attenuation zone of the filter (Figure 2f). Since there are events faster than τp, we looked at the percentage of events slower than the attenuation threshold (%slower) corresponding to each of the LPF settings and was found to be ∼45.6 and ∼99.1% for 10 and 100 kHz LPF settings, respectively, at 300 mV (for events shown in Figure 2d). The %slower at 1000 mV were ∼6.8 and 99.9%, respectively, for 10 and 100 kHz LPF settings. Thus, higher LPF (made possible by a high SNR) enables the collection of nonattenuated events and thereby a nondistorted evaluation of protein characteristics.
3.1.5. Shape of CR−V, SNR, and Energetics of Transport. As the pore size increases, the analyte confinement would decrease and, by extension, the number of detectable events. This would lead to a drop in sensitivity, which is the case in zones 3 and 4. As the pore size is further increased (zone 4), we see a departure of the CR−V relationship from the linear nature (Figure 3b). A nonlinear CR−V response is indicative of barrier-limited transport (i.e., one that follows van’t Hoff−
Arrhenius formalism).9,34 However, the nonlinearity in the CR−V response is not because of a change in the transport mechanism but rather due to the poor SNR in larger pore sizes, evident through the restoration of the diffusion-limited transport mechanism upon reducing the LPF to 5 kHz (Figure 3c). To ensure that the CR−V pattern seen in Figure 3b is not due to the undercounting of events, we varied the peak detection coefficient (PDC, the standard deviation of the baseline in the analysis window) from 5 (default value) to 4 in 0.5 steps. Decreasing the PDC below 4 could capture noise spikes from the baseline. As seen in Figure 3b, the shape of the CR−V pattern is retained irrespective of the investigated PDC values, which strengthen the notion that the observed deviation from the diffusion-limited transport is mainly due to the poor SNR and not due to undercounting of events. Similarly, PDC was increased from the default value of 5−8 for the 5 kHz filtered trace, as shown in Figure 3c. This was to see if the choice of PDC would impact the nature of the CR−V,
and as seen, with all of the PDC values investigated, the linear relationship between CR and V was maintained. If the transport mechanism is truly barrier-limited, the log of CR with V would be linear. However, as seen in Figure 3d, two distinct linear regions with a breakpoint can be seen. This is further evidence for the transport being not truly barrier-limited and further emphasizes the need to scan a broad voltage range to identify the transport mechanism at play. It is thus vital to assess the influence of noise on the observed CR and identify applied voltages that are hampered by noise. One approach to calculating the noise floor is through the false event rate
approach,10 which was found to be ∼0.03 events/s for the 10 kHz filtered data originating from Figure 3a. However, as shown in Figure S4a, this only classifies the lowest voltage as being hampered by the noise of the measurement. However, looking at the plot of the log of CR with V (Figure 3d), the second linear regime (low voltage) has a higher slope, which could be arising due to false events. Thus, we defined the intersection point of the two linear regimes of the log CR−V curve as the ceiling of the noise floor (see SI Section 4 for more details on the intersection point). Furthermore, the reversal of the CR−V relationship from nonlinear to linear is not limited to larger pores but is also seen with smaller pores filtered using a higher than optimal LPF, as seen in Figure 3f. The linear CR−V relationship is restored upon filtering with a lower LPF setting, as seen in Figure 3g. The need to use a lower LPF setting is further emphasized by Figure 3h, which shows a nonlinear log CR−V plot indicating the transport mechanism to be not barrier-limited (contrary to the nonlinear CR−V curve shown in Figure 3f). These observations further emphasize the underlying relationship between detectable events and the SNR and its implications on the (evaluation of) transport mechanism (other examples are shown in Figure S5). Since the maximum available bandwidth
(Bmax) is proportional to ( I )
VC
2/3
n , where Vn and ∑C are
voltage noise and total capacitance at the amplifier’s input, respectively, and ΔI/Vn is correlated with the SNR, to operate
at a higher bandwidth, a higher ΔI (or lower Vn) is needed.35 This relationship shows the voltage dependence of Bmax, and for low SNR measurements, a higher than optimal LPF could lead to Bmax being lower than the operational bandwidth, leading to a higher false event rate than that predicted by Gaussian distributed noise models. This could be one of the reasons for the change in the slope of log CR−V curves in some instances (Figure 3d,h). As such, when the SNR is sufficient, the CR−V predicted transport mechanism does not depend on the LPF setting, as seen in Figure 3j,k.
3.2. Protein Unfolding Kinetics. We limit the discussion hereafter to pore sizes in zones 1, 2, and 3 (we excluded zone 4 due to an insufficient SNR at 10 kHz LPF). Within this range of pore sizes, proteins are known to undergo voltage-induced unfolding and have been demonstrated widely using planar
nanopores.24,36−38 The understanding of protein unfolding in nanopipettes is meager (i.e., relatively unexplored), and given the tapered geometry of nanopipettes, we sought to explore the behavior of proteins (with hSTf as the model protein) under a wide range of voltages and pore sizes spanning EO- and EPdominant transport regimes. We chose hSTf as the model protein since it has been studied using silicon nitride
nanopores in recent years.24,36,37 We would first discuss the EO-dominant transport. All experiments in this transport regime were carried out using 2 M LiCl (pH ∼ 8). The protein

was always placed in the pipette due to minimal analyte clogging in the pipette to bath translocation configuration (discussed later in the manuscript). We first looked at the ΔI distribution in zone 1 and zone 2. A broad ΔI distribution was observed (e.g., Figure S2b), which is typical for protein translocations. ΔIp showed an Ohmic relationship with the applied voltage for the pores in zone 2 (Figure 4a), which is indicative of the absence of voltage-driven unfolding (vide infra). Similar behavior was seen for pores in zone 3 as well. The time constant (τ0, see SI Section 2 under Time Constant for the definition and reasons for using this parameter) also showed similar behavior with applied voltage, as seen in Figure 4b. Higher τ0 is indicative of a higher slow-moving population, and the decrease in τ0 with increasing voltage reflects well on the increase in translocation speed with increasing voltage. The slope of the ΔIp−V curves for zone 2 and zone 3 pores was plotted with the tip diameter (dp, Figure 4c), which showed a
weak linear relationship (R2 ∼ 0.31). This is expected because if the protein is not unfolding, the ΔIp would be dictated by the
molecular volume of the native state ( = ·

Heff are molecular volume and effective sensing length of the

0.0026 ± 0.004 pA/mV. Using this value and assuming that the native state of hSTf is preserved under these conditions (molecular volume of hSTf ∼ 144 nm3), Heff was found to be ∼285 ± 22 nm. This value was then used to calculate the dp (L = Heff in eq 1) and compared against the tip diameter evaluated from TEM imaging (dp(TEM)): the two quantities for zone 1 pores were found to be within 10%. Unlike pores in zones 2 and 3, the pores in zone 1 exhibited two distinct linear ranges in ΔIp−V curves: a decrease in ΔIp (green region of Figure 4d) followed by a slight increase (purple region of Figure 4d). Since ΔIp is related to Λ, a decrease in ΔIp indicates a decrease in the Λ of the protein, which is indicative of voltage-driven unfolding. The folded protein structure has a higher molecular volume compared to its unfolded counterpart since the former has inner cavities that contribute to the overall effective diameter. Since ΔIp is sensitive to the effective diameter of the protein (i.e., the higher the effective diameter, the higher the ΔIp), when a protein unfolds, a decrease in ΔIp is expected. Since ΔIp increases with increasing voltage for a rigid particle (i.e.,

), the increase in ΔIp (purple region, Figure 4d)
could indicate that the protein has unfolded to a limit governed both by the protein characteristics and the conditions at play. A similar behavior was seen with τ0 as well (Figure 4e). Since ΔI distribution (e.g., Figure S2b) does not show two distinct

populations resembling native and unfolded protein states, the use of the more prevalent two-state model to elucidate the transition between the native and the unfolded state of a protein (i.e., cooperative unfolding) is less conducive for the results observed in this study. On the contrary, multistep folding−unfolding pathways are observed with those that exhibit stable intermediates that are detectable: when unfolding occurs through a multistep process, the activation energy for unfolding is distributed among the intermediate states and would lead to faster unfolding compared to the twostate model. Moreover, this distribution of activation energy from a concentrated two-state model would also lead to
gradual/noncooperative transitioning.40−42 The absence of two distinct populations in ΔI distributions is indicative of such gradual/noncooperative unfolding. With the nanopipette, the translocating proteins are subjected to higher electric fields (in the order of Mega V/m), which would enable the transition of the protein to a higher energy state. Since nanopipettes provide a real-time readout of the proteins translocating through the nanopore, the proteins at such higher energy states become detectable. Our results thus indicate a gradual/noncooperative voltage-induced unfolding and dunfold = 1 (degree of unfolding, see SI Section 2 under Degree of Unfolding for more details) represents the voltage at which voltage-induced unfolding is maximal under the experimental conditions beyond which the protein behavior becomes Ohmic, which is indicative of a voltage-stable translocating structure. Furthermore, the voltage-induced unfolding (with zone 1 pores) is justified by the decrease of ΔIp with increasing voltage up to about ∼700 mV (i.e., non-Ohmic behavior). This decrease of ΔIp with increasing voltage is possible if the molecular volume decreases with increasing voltage, which is the case with unfolding proteins. With pores in zone 2 and beyond, the ΔIp increases with increasing applied voltage in a linear manner (i.e., Ohmic
behavior), indicating the absence of voltage-induced unfolding of the hSTf protein. The dunfold for the pores in zone 1 is shown in Figure 4f and shows how the unfolded population gradually increases with applied voltage (i.e., noncooperative unfolding). Next, we looked at the influence of voltage-induced volumetric characteristics of hSTf on SNR in different zones.
The SNR was defined as SNR = ( I /3 ) + 3 +

2,
which represents the maximum SNR encompassing the broad distribution of proteins (see SI Section 2 under SNR for the definitions and reasons). The SNR3σ increased with increasing applied voltage for pores in zones 2 and 3 (Figure 4g). This is because the increase of ΔIp with voltage outweighs that of σI thanks to the low dielectric noise properties of quartz. Moreover, this property allowed experiments to be conducted at higher voltages, such as ±1000 mV, without having to worry about open-pore noise, which is not a luxury available with silicon nitride pores. The SNR3σ for pores in zone 1 (i.e., those that undergo voltage-drive unfolding) showed a decrease in the SNR3σ with increasing voltage (Figure 4h). This is because, unlike pores in zones 2 and 3, pores in zone 1 induce protein unfolding, which would lead to a decrease in ΔIp with voltage, as seen in Figure 4d. Thus, protein unfolding influences the behavior of ΔIp, τ0, and SNR3σ and could be used as metrics to evaluate whether a protein is undergoing unfolding or not. The SNR3σ at 300 mV is shown for all pores (Figure 4i), and we see that as the pore size decreases, the SNR3σ increases. This is anticipated since the percentage of volumetric occlusion by the analyte increases with the decreasing pore size. This is also evident through the two traces shown in Figure 4i, where the smaller pore showed deeper blockades compared to the larger pore.

driven unfolding and high SNR3σ compared to other pore sizes. Interestingly, unlike in the EOF-dominant cases, ΔIp showed a linear relationship with applied voltage, indicating that the
protein is not unfolding under electrophoretic conditions (Figure 5b). Although EOF and EPF are in opposing directions, the contribution of EOF becomes meager with

increasing electrolyte concentration. We hypothesize that the presence of the two opposing forces could facilitate the voltage-driven unfolding in the EOF-dominant cases, and the negligible contribution of EOF at high electrolyte concentrations may allow the protein to translocate without any detectable unfolding. Furthermore, unlike in the EOFdominant transport mode, the sensitivity (i.e., the slope of the CR−V curve) increased with the increasing pore size in both zone 1 and zone 2 (Figure 5d). This is more anticipated since the capture radius scales proportionally with the pore size. This further strengthens our hypothesis that the increase in sensitivity in zone 1 pores in the EOF-dominant realm is influenced by a change in the protein conformation (i.e., voltage-driven unfolding). The inset of Figure 5d shows the sensitivity of EPF- and EOF-dominant transport conditions for comparable pores. As seen, in larger pores, EPF produces a higher sensitivity and eventually decreases below that produced by EOF-dominant transport. This is attributed to an interplay between the capture radius and protein unfolding, which, as explained earlier, causes opposite trends in sensitivity for the two transport modes. The SNR3σ,300mV (i.e., SNR3σ at 300 mV), like with EO-dominant cases, increased with decreasing pore size due to the increasing volumetric occlusion by the analyte (Figure 5e). However, as seen in Figure 5e, the SNR3σ of EP-dominant events (magenta squares) are of lower magnitude compared to their EO counterparts (black squares). A pure geometric argument taking volumetric occlusion into account would suggest an unfolded protein to produce a lower SNR compared to its globular counterpart. However, since Figure 5e involves two transport mechanisms, concluding solely based on volumetric occlusion and protein structure is challenging since the signal magnitude of proteins changes
with electrolyte chemistry.23 Up to now, the discussion has solely focused on the forward direction (i.e., pipette to bath translocations). However, nanopipettes have been shown to exhibit direction-dependent
transport properties.43 Although such properties have been investigated with DNA, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been explored with proteins. Given the charge heterogeneity of proteins, voltage, pore size, electrolyte chemistry, and transport mechanism-dependent structural changes, it is important to explore the backward transport direction as well (i.e., bath to pipette). A representative current trace corresponding to hSTf translocating (in 4 M LiCl) through an ∼10.4 nm pore electrophoretically in the backward direction is shown in Figure 6a. The ΔIp shows an Ohmic behavior indicating the absence of voltage-drive protein unfolding (Figure 6b). However, we have found that the backward direction often leads to clogging (Figures 6d,e and 7). Although a considerable number of events are collectible through EPF-dominant transport in the backward direction, clogging happens in EOF-dominant cases before a significant amount of data can be collected (Table S5 and Figure 6d,e). To elucidate in the context of the number of events (using EOF transport of hSTf), a pore that eventually clogged irreversibly (forward direction) produced >30,000 events, while the best pore in the backward direction produced a mere ∼4200 events. Similar behavior in the backward direction was observed with BSA (Figure 7a), hemoglobin (Figure 7b), and ferritin (Figure 7c) as well. Of the four proteins, pore clogging with ferritin was more severe, where instantaneous irreversible clogging was observed (Figure 7c, only ∼19 events were
collectible). Upon diluting the ferritin by 10× and increasing the pore size from ∼19 to ∼27 nm, ∼800 events could be collected before irreversibly clogging with the analyte (Figure 7d). Further diluting ferritin (50× diluted) allowed a few more events to be collected (Figure 7e, ∼1100 events using an ∼32 nm pore). Increasing the pore size up to ∼38 nm alleviated analyte clogging (Figure 7f) and permitted a higher ferritin concentration than the clogged cases to be used (4× diluted). An excess of 63,000 events were collected, and the pore remained open. The CR vs V for this larger pore resembled a barrier-limited scenario (Figure S5d), which was due to an insufficient SNR (Figure S5e). A similar concentrationdependent clogging behavior was seen with hemoglobin as well, where ∼2100 and ∼3800 were collected in the backward direction by diluting hemoglobin 5× (620 nM) and 20× (155 nM), respectively. Analyte clogging could originate from a range of reasons, such as cotranslocations (i.e., two proteins entering at the same time), electrostatics (e.g., a positively charged protein adhering to a negative surface), pore corking (e.g., the pore diameter is smaller than the protein diameter). Since the size of the pores used for BSA, hemoglobin, and ferritin are larger than the protein, pore corking from a single protein could be ruled out. Although all of the proteins are netnegatively charged, the charge heterogeneity of proteins could lead to adsorption through positively charged domains (i.e., electrostatics). Another avenue for clogging is cotranslocations. Reducing the concertation of the protein could decrease the probability of cotranslocations. Both cotranslocations and electrostatics-mediated analyte clogging are more prominent in smaller pores and become less severe as the pore size increases. Based on the results in Figures 6 and 7, under similar conditions, the backward transport direction leads to significantly more clogging. Moreover, events as many as ∼600,000 have been collected with apo-ferritin from a single pipette in the forward direction (data not shown), and it is not uncommon to see protein translocations lasting for hours without any clogging issues in the forward transport direction. In the backward transport direction, proteins can arrive at the pore in a multitude of directions or trajectories (i.e., the capture volume is nearly a full sphere rather than a hemisphere). On the contrary, in the forward transport direction, the tapered geometry may lead to some degree of hydrodynamic alignment of the protein along the pore axis, which could contribute to lowering cotranslocations and, by extension, clogging. We speculate that the gradual confinement offered by the taper acts to promote single file ordering of the proteins. Thus, there could be fewer cotranslocations in the forward direction compared to the backward direction, which may lead to a longer pore lifetime. Based on these results, we concluded that protein clogging is primarily influenced by the protein’s placement (i.e., inside the pipette vs the bath) rather than its identity. Thus, regardless of the identity of the proteins studied herein, a consistent trend emerges: proteins are more susceptible to clogging in the backward transport direction where cotranslocations may be prevalent, as opposed to the forward transport direction. The ability and the “know-how” to circumvent pore clogging by the analyte were then used to record translocations at the highest available LPF setting of the Axopatch 200B (i.e., 100 kHz) for all four proteins used in this study (i.e., hSTf, BSA, hemoglobin, and ferritin). The low dielectric noise properties of quartz coupled with the ruleset we have formulated enabled the successful translocation of hSTf (∼9 nm pore), BSA (∼9.2

nm pore), hemoglobin (∼6.4 nm pore), and ferritin (∼15.2 nm pore), as shown in Figure 8. The τp (for 1000 mV) for hSTf, BSA, hemoglobin, and ferritin were found to be ∼13, ∼13 to ∼11, and ∼9 μs, respectively, which is slower than the theoretically predicted attenuation threshold (10 μs) of the 100 kHz LPF (except for ferritin). The nonattenuated population percentages were ∼99.9, 98.0, 99.9, and 82.1% for hSTf, BSA, hemoglobin, and ferritin, respectively (at 1000 mV). A total of 98 653, 62 196, 13 411, and 13 403 events were collected from hSTf, BSA, hemoglobin, and ferritin, respectively. Apart from hSTf (2 M LiCl), all other experiments were done in 4 M LiCl. Although more events
could be collected using larger diameter pores, it comes at the expense of SNR, which is crucial for high bandwidth recordings. Thus, a delicate balance between the protein-topore (in size) should be achieved to minimize pore clogging while maximizing the SNR to collect a considerably large pool of events at higher bandwidths. We intend to expand this ruleset to a host of proteins spanning a wide range of diameters in a future study. To gain a fundamental understanding of a few of the salient experimental observations seen in this study, numerical solving of the Poisson−Nernst−Planck equations and the Navier− Stokes equations was performed. Briefly, an axisymmetric

model was used, and the inner diameters of the nanopipette were roughly based on those obtained by TEM. An insulating boundary is used for the nanopipette walls, while ground and potential boundary conditions are used for the fluidic boundaries on either side of the nanopipette. Electroosmotic flow (EOF) was modeled using an electroosmotic boundary condition for the nanopipette walls where the critical input is the ζ potential. Importantly, the ζ potential of quartz varies with salt concentration, and so the conductivity of the salt was incorporated into the model using this boundary condition. The electrostatics of the system, however, is not influenced by the conductivity of the electrolyte. For all of the numerical models, a fixed value of electrophoretic mobility was used (1 ×
10−8 m2/(V s)), and the ζ potential was varied from −5 to −30 mV. Most of the experiments in this study were performed using 2 M LiCl, which yielded EOF-driven events despite the counteracting electrophoretic forces. EOF-driven events, especially under relatively high molar LiCl (e.g., >1 M LiCl),
have been reported elsewhere23 as well and seem to be the effect that disappears at higher salt concentrations such as 4 M LiCl. Based on the Grahame equation (see the Supporting Information), the ζ potential of the glass surface is most sensitive to electrolyte concentration at low salt (<1 M) and then undergoes a mild and steady decline at higher salt concentrations. Since a relatively meager decrease in ζ potential is expected from 2 to 4 M LiCl, we sought to explore the balance of EOF and EP Drift within this range. The sensitivity of EOF-dominated transport on ζ potential was explored here, and it was found that a ζ potential difference of less than 5 mV could alter the net transport of a protein. For the standard electrophoretic mobility used here, a ζ potential of −10 mV led to a peak EP drift velocity of approximately 70 mm/s and a peak EOF velocity of 50 mm/s, yielding EP dominance at the pore (Figure 9a). However, a ζ potential of −15 mV led to the same EP drift velocity and a higher EOF velocity of 80 mm/s leading to EOF dominance. The sensitivity of EOF to ζ potential is clearly a critical factor in nanopore experiments, including those at high salt conditions, such as 2 M LiCl, which was used in the present study. Since EOF is also a function of the electric field inside the nanopipette, the EOF and EP drift velocities have nearly identical trends but are opposing one another for negatively
charged analytes. This is due to the cations (Li+) being positive, whereas the analyte is negatively charged. The convention used here was that EOF is positive and EP drift velocity is negative to show that they are opposing one another (Figure 9b). As the pore size is increased, both EOF and EP drift velocity decreases inside the pore but increases far away (>200 nm) from the pore. The crossover point is approximately located 150 nm from the nanopipette tip. Therefore, for both EOF and EP-dominant transport, the capture radius increases as the pore increases in diameter and by extension, CR should also, therefore, increase with dp. Since EP drift and EOF counteract each other, the relative net analyte motion (EP + EOF) will directly influence the sensitivity to voltage (a metric that was quantified in the experimental part of this study). Recalling that sensitivity is the slope of the CR versus voltage curve, an analogous relationship is observed considering EP drift, EOF, and net migration at a specified distance (1 μm) from the pore (Figure 9c). The true capture radius (r*) is found using a certain threshold for the migration speed that can overcome diffusion. For illustration
purposes, an arbitrary threshold of 0.25 m/s was set for the purely EP-dominant capture scenario (Figure 9c). It is clear that capture radius increases into the nanopipette tapered region as voltage increases and dp increases; however, the exact relationship (e.g., linear, exponential, etc.) has not been investigated. As the capture radius extends up the tapered region of the nanopipette, the hemispherical surface area increases nonlinearly. Assuming that the hemisphere can be modeled as a flat planar surface, the surface area of a circular plane will extend and rapidly grow as the capture radius increases. The relationship can therefore be written as CR ≈
π(r* tan α)2, where α is the half-cone angle. Since α was observed to increase with increasing pore diameter (Figure 1b), α is also a critical factor that can increase the CR and, therefore, the sensitivity parameter calculated in our experiments. The factors that seem to increase sensitivity include the dp and α, whereas in conditions where EOF and EP drift are counteracting, the sensitivity would be reduced (Figure 9d). This roughly coincides with Figure 5d, wherein EP-dominant transport showed a clear exponential increase in sensitivity for the dp ∼ 7−12.5 nm pore size range, whereas EOF-dominant transport lacked an exponential increase. The location of capture and the dynamics with respect to the applied voltage are observed to be nonlinear within the nanopipette system, and further investigation into the sensitivity parameter could help understand the relative contributions of EP drift and EOF in the future.
4. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this study, we have discussed a detailed framework to minimize pore clogging by the analyte and improve the SNR by focusing on the influence of pore size, electric field, transport direction (i.e., forward and backward), and mechanism (electroosmosis and electrophoresis) both on the translocation process and the conformation of proteins (i.e., folded vs unfolded). Pore clogging by the analyte is a legacy issue with nanopores, which negatively impacts the lifetime of a pore and its ability to collect large amounts of events. Both (i.e., high lifetime and event count) are crucial to translate into the commercial space and for approaches such as machine learning to gain more insight into event signatures. In this study, in the absence of any surface functionalization methods, we have developed a framework to achieve two core goals: minimizing pore clogging and increasing the SNR. To achieve these two goals, a host of factors were tuned and optimized, mainly electrolyte chemistry, pore size, and transport direction. These optimization parameters directly influenced the transport mechanism (2 M LiCl showed electroosmotic events while 4 M LiCl showed electrophoretic events), SNR (smaller pores showed the highest SNR, and with such pores, electroosmotic events showed a higher SNR), sticking probability (forward transport direction was reliant against clogging, while the backward transport direction was more prone to clogging). Thus, the above observations could be condensed as follows.
4.1. Pore Clogging and Transport Direction.
i. Forward transport direction is more resilient against pore clogging, while backward transport direction is more prone to analyte clogging. The ability to access the pore from a multitude of directions promoting cotranslocations was thought to be the reason behind enhanced clogging probability in the backward direction,

while the tapered geometry could be hydrodynamically aligning the analytes with the pore axis and, by extension, lowering the clogging probability in the forward direction. ii. (i) enable recordings at higher voltages, which otherwise (more often) lead to intermittent and thereafter irreversible analyte clogging.
4.2. Transport Direction and SNR.
iii. With forward transport direction, smaller pore sizes lead to high SNR recordings, enabling high bandwidth data acquisition (100 kHz LPF with the Axopatch 200B) to circumvent signal attenuation. The pore size spanned well into small pores that are <2× the size of proteins, where sufficient confinement and the SNR will lead to high bandwidth studies in the future. iv. (iii) is also facilitated by the low dielectric noise properties of quartz. Otherwise, with increasing LPF, the increase in open-pore noise could overwhelm the signal amplitude. v. (iv) Facilitate recordings at higher voltages, which is often challenging with most membrane material due to noisy open-pore currents (prevented by (iii)).
4.3. Electrolyte Chemistry and Transport Properties.
vi. The SNR increase is also governed by the electrolyte chemistry, where for hSTf, 2 M LiCl was seen to showcase a higher SNR compared to 4 M LiCl. vii. (vi) is correlated with the dominant transport direction for hSTf, where 2 M LiCl leads to translocations in the electroosmotic direction while 4 M LiCl leads to translocations in the electrophoretic direction.
This optimization ruleset enabled recording >20,000 events/ pipette very conveniently and often allowed the acquisition of >50,000 events/pipette. We have even demonstrated >100,000 events/pipette, which, if left to run longer, could even achieve >500,000 events/pipette, as was seen with apo-ferritin. To the best of our knowledge, such statistics are not documented with nanopipettes and would pave the way for these sensors to venture into the commercial space. While exploring the optimal conditions to achieve such impressive event statistics, a few more parameters that are often overlooked came under scrutiny:
a. Voltage must be swept until the slope of CR−V (i.e., sensitivity) does not change appreciably with each voltage sweep (i.e., reaching a state of dynamic equilibrium). b. Appropriate LPF must be used to process the data. A higher than optimal LPF could lead to distortion of CR− V curves mainly due to missing events due to a poor SNR.
Both (a) and (b) are often overlooked in literature, perhaps due to their ostensible triviality. However, we see that (a) changes over time and sometimes takes as much as ∼2 h to reach a steady value, and the sensitivity of this steady state is often a few-fold higher than the initially recorded sensitivity value. On the other hand, overlooking (b) could lead to misinterpretation of the energetics of the transport mechanism (i.e., diffusion vs barrier-limited). With appropriate LPF, we found that the transport through all pore sizes was diffusionlimited, and without such optimization, especially with larger pores, the transport seemed to be barrier-limited.
The framework for optimizing translocation enabled the study of the implication of the external parameters on the structure of the core model protein, hSTf. Voltage-induced unfolding was seen with zone 1 pores (with EO-dominant events), whereas the ΔIp−V relationship was Ohmic in other zones, indicating the absence of such unfolding. On the contrary, no voltage-driven unfolding was seen with EPdominant events, even with zone 1 pores. In the EO realm, the EO and EP forces are opposing (for negatively charged protein translocating through a quartz nanopipette), whereas in the EP-dominant realm, due to the high salt (i.e., 4 M LiCl), the opposing EO is meager. We believe that these opposing forces (EO and EP forces) could be responsible for the electric field unfolding, as seen with zone 1 pores. With increasing electrolyte concentration, the EO contribution to the overall transport mechanism becomes meager, and EP starts to play a more dominant role. We see that EO and EP are not merely transport mechanisms: they showcase a correlative impact on the observed SNR, clogging probability, translocating conformation of the protein, and directional-dependent transport properties. Thus, our findings showcased a framework for optimal translocation conditions (e.g., resilience against pore clogging and a high SNR for high bandwidth recordings) for proteins and the implications of the optimization parameters on the translocation properties and the protein structure. We believe that these findings could help improve future nanopore studies and overcome legacy issues associated with the technology.
