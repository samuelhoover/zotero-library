ABSTRACT: We have studied the influence of segmental dipole orientation on the solution properties of polyzwitterions using dynamic and static light scattering of poly(2methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC), n-butylsubstituted choline phosphate polymers (PMBP), and their diblock (PMPC-b-PMBP) copolymers in solutions of different salt concentration. We find that these three structures exhibit dramatically different aggregation behaviors. For the conditions in our study, PMPC is a swollen excluded-volume chain without significant presence of dipolar correlations as evident from the lack of sensitivity to the ionic strength of the solution. In contrast, PMBP self-assembles into finite-sized structures in solution, which are stabilized by electrostatic dipole−dipole interactions. Evidence of these interactions is also present in the diblock polymer, PMPB-b-PMPC, which self-assembles into two distinct, stable aggregates in addition to unaggregated chains. These results contribute to the breadth of understanding of polyzwitterions in solution and provide a platform for future simulation and experimental explorations.
P
olyzwitterions are composed of repeat units having permanent charge pairs, or dipoles (Figure 1). The
dipoles, prescribed by the chemical structure, can be oriented toward the backbone of the polymer chain (as in polysulfobetaine) or away from the backbone (as in poly(2methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC), 1). In general, polyzwitterions exhibit unique solution behavior due
to these dipoles.1−4 Since dipole−dipole interactions are electrostatic in nature, the assembly processes with polyzwitterions can be tuned with experimental variables that affect electrostatics, such as ionic strength. In general, the polyzwitterion behavior depends on the dipole density along the chain, the dipole length, identities of the charges of the
dipole, and the local dielectric properties.5−13
There has been extensive characterization of polyzwitterion solutions, for example, using viscosity, osmometry, turbidity,
light scattering, and phase behavior.14−22 These studies show that in dilute solutions individual chains of polyzwitterions exhibit chain swelling upon an increase in added salt concentration. Such an effect, called antipolyelectrolyte effect due to its reverse trend from uniformly charged polyelectrolyte chains, has attracted significant theoretical modeling and
experimental efforts.23−28 At lower salt concentrations, the dipoles organize in an antiparallel manner; upon addition of salt they unpair due to electrostatic screening, and thus the coils open into swollen conformations. The effect of dipole orientation on the salt responsiveness and association of polyzwitterions in solutions has not yet been studied systematically. The focus of the present Letter is to compare the behavior of two polyzwitterion homopolymers having opposite dipole orientations, as well as the corresponding block copolymer, in which the different dipoles are isolated into separate blocks. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), we have investigated the solution properties of PMPC (1), n-butylsubstituted choline phosphates (PMBP, 2), and a PMPC-b
PMBP diblock copolymer (3),29 each of which was prepared using controlled radical polymerization methods. Indeed, dramatic differences in the aqueous structures were found in these three systems, confirming that dipole directionality and

functionality combine to impact structure formation in dilute solutions. We performed static and dynamic light scattering on three polyzwitterion systems: (a) PMPC, where the segmental dipole is directed away from the polymer chain backbone, (b) PMBP, where the segmental dipole is directed toward the chain backbone, and (c) a diblock polymer composed of PMPC and PMBP. Remarkably, we find that both PMBP and its block copolymer with PMPC self-assemble into aggregates, whereas PMPC itself does not produce aggregates under the experimental conditions of the present study. The solution behaviors of aqueous PMPC (1), with two different chain lengths (PMPC200 and PMPC107, Dp 200 and
107, respectively) were investigated at 20 °C. For PMPC200, the Zimm analysis (see Figure S1) gives the molecular weight
M, Rg, and A2 as 90 000 g/mol, 9.5 nm, and 4 × 10−6 mol cm3/
g2. The corresponding values for PMPC107 are 50 000 g/mol,
7.3 nm, and 4 × 10−6 mol cm3/g2. The weight-averaged molecular weights determined from the Zimm analysis are consistent with the GPC data (75 000 and 42 000 g/mol, respectively, for PMPC200 and PMPC107). In DLS, both of the above samples clearly exhibit only one diffusive mode (Figure S2), yielding a hydrodynamic radius Rh
of 4 ± 0.33 and 5 nm, respectively, for PMPC107 and PMPC200. The shape factor, Rg/Rh, is 1.82 and 1.93 for PMPC107 and PMPC200, respectively. This suggests that the chain conformation is close to a swollen excluded volume chain. In fact, the ratio of Rg for these two polymers, Rg(PMPC200)/ Rg(PMPC107), is found to be equal to the ratio

, showing that the size exponent v for
the radius of gyration is 0.6, as expected for a swollen coil in a good solvent. At 5 g/L in water, we did not observe PMPC aggregation
with increasing NaCl concentration from 4 × 10−6 (corresponding to no added salt, see SI) to 1.5 M. As shown in Figure 2a, Rh is independent of salt concentration. This clearly
suggests an absence of electrostatic effects contributing to the size and shape of PMPC in dilute solutions. In view of the size exponent v being 0.6 and A2 being positive, we conclude that PMPC is an unaggregated swollen excluded volume chain without significant intrachain dipole associations. These results
are consistent with the earlier results of Matsuda et al.22 PMBP (2), with its inverted dipole compared to PMPC, presented distinctly different aqueous solution behavior. Both PMBP164 and PMBP96 (Dp 164 and 96, respectively) form
aggregates at 5 g/L concentration in water at 20 °C regardless
of salt concentration (4 × 10−6 to 1.5 M). In addition to its inverted dipole relative to PMPC, the PMBP zwitterions feature n-butyl groups instead of the methyl groups in PMPC. In principle, this additional hydrophobicity is expected to contribute to the solution structure of PMBP. Also, even for a single chain, intrachain dipole interactions are expected to be enhanced by an effectively lower dielectric constant arising from the presence of the butyl group at every monomer unit. DLS revealed two distinct modes for both PMBP164 and PMBP96. Extreme care was taken in identifying these two modes to be diffusive, as shown in Figure S2 (d−f). The resulting hydrodynamic radii Rh1 and Rh2 for PMBP164 at different salt concentrations are given in Table 1 and Figures 2b
and 2c. Rh1, corresponding to the unaggregated polymer, is 3.7 nm for salt-free conditions, increasing continuously to 5.5 nm as the salt concentration is increased to 1.5 M NaCl, exhibiting “antipolyelectrolyte” behavior. In contrast, Rh2 is about an order of magnitude larger, decreasing from 38 to 32 nm as salt
concentration is increased from 4 × 10−6 to 1.5 M. In terms of percentage, this decrease is milder than the corresponding increase in Rh1 for the same salt concentration range. These results for PMBP164 are consistent with the results found by
Niu et al. for polycarboxybetaine.20 Similar to the two sizes for PMBP164, salt-free solutions of PMBP96 also show two sizes, Rh1 = 2.8 ± 0.5 nm and Rh2 = 33 ± 2 nm. Thus, formation of aggregates is a common feature for both of these molecular weights. The observed salt concentration dependence of Rh1 is consistent with intrachain dipole−dipole interactions. At low salt concentrations (and presumably low local dielectric constant arising from the butyl group), the dipole−dipole interactions are strong. Addition of salt progressively screens the dipole−dipole interactions. As a result the coil radius increases as the salt concentration increases. For the case of aggregates, represented by Rh2, the dipole−dipole interactions are both intrachain and interchain. Since the number of dipolar groups participating in the assembly of aggregates is rather large, a considerable amount of added salt is required to simultaneously screen all dipole pairs. For the range of salt concentration used in the present study, only a weak effect is seen in the size of the aggregate, again
consistent with the conclusions of Niu et al.20

The average radius of gyration Rg2 of the aggregates was obtained from Guinier analysis (Figure S1), and the results at different salt concentrations are included in Table 1. From Rh2 and Rg2, we have determined the shape factor Rg2/Rh2 as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2d. The observed values of Rg2/ Rh2 in the range of 1.18−1.47 are consistent with spherical microgel-like aggregates. Thus, the behavior of PMBP is qualitatively different from that of PMPC. First, PMPC shows only one diffusive mode in DLS (corresponding to unaggregated chains), whereas PMBP shows two distinct diffusive modes (corresponding to unaggregated chains and aggregates). The hydrodynamic radius of PMPC does not depend on the salt concentration. On the other hand, the hydrodynamic radius of PMBP increases with salt concentration. These observations point to a significantly greater role of dipole−dipole correlations for PMPB relative to that of PMPC. This behavior could be attributed to the local lower dielectric constant arising from the butyl group at every repeat unit of PMBP, thus enhancing the strength of the dipole pairs. The dipole pairs, both intrachain and interchain, are also responsible for the aggregate sizes represented by Rh2. The Rh2 depends only weakly on salt concentration, thus the butyl groups may play an additional role in forming aggregates. It appears that this latter effect is weak because Niu et al. have reported observations on polycarboxybetaine, which does not contain any butyl or equivalent group at the side chain end, similar to
ours.20 To investigate the interference by PMPC on the aggregation capacity of PMBP, we have studied the aqueous solutions of diblock copolymer PMPC27-b-PMBP24 (Dp,MPC 27 and Dp,MBP
24) at different NaCl concentrations (4 × 10−6 to 1.5 M) at 20 °C (Figure 3). PMPC, being a swollen coil, might be expected to reduce PMBP aggregate size in a diblock copolymer form. Alternatively, the occurrence of interblock complexation would lead to even larger aggregates. Such complexation among the opposite dipoles of PMPC and PMBP may be envisaged as either head-to-tail or antiparallel configurations, as depicted in Figure 3a. Independent of the details of dipole correlations, we anticipated that the PMPC-block-PMBP copolymers would form a population of aggregates of certain average size in a mixture with unaggregated chains. Unexpectedly, DLS experiments performed on the zwitterionic diblock copolymer samples gave clear evidence of three diffusive modes (relative weights of these modes are given in SI). The corresponding hydrodynamic radii for these three modes, Rh1, Rh2, and Rh3, are given in Figure 3c−e. The values of Rh1, Rh2, and Rh3 are about 3, 11, and 55 nm, respectively. The smallest size is attributable to unaggregated diblock chains. The value of Rh1 is smaller than the values of unaggregated PMPC and PMBP due to the lower molecular weight of the diblock copolymer. The dependence of Rh1 on salt concentration shows a nonmonotonic behavior. It is seen from Figure 3c that Rh1 first decreases as the salt concentration increases, but then it increases again when the salt concentration is increased further. The other two sizes must correspond to different aggregates. It was surprising to observe the two different populations of aggregates, each exhibiting nonmonotonic dependence on salt concentration. As the salt concentration increases, the size first decreases and then increases as evident in Figure 3d and 3e. We note that Zimm plots and Guinier plots for this diblock copolymer system are not reliable due to the occurrence of three modes. While dipole
interactions are crucial for the formation of self-assembled aggregates, it is unclear at this stage how these result in two kinds of aggregates. The role of segmental dipolar orientations on the selfassembly of polyzwitterions is investigated for the first time using DLS. For our experimental conditions, the solution properties of PMPC, PMBP, and PMPC-b-PMBP are clearly different. While we see no evidence for the influence of dipolar interactions on the structure of PMPC in solutions of varied NaCl concentrations, dipole−dipole interactions lead to larger aggregate-like structures for PMBP and PMPC-b-PMBP. The origin for the presence of these interactions in PMBP solutions and their absence in PMPC solutions is unclear but is likely due to internal factors such as the presence of hydrophobic groups on the phosphate ion of PMBP. The formation of two distinct aggregate size scales in PMPC-b-PMBP solutions was unexpected and requires further investigation using simulations in conjunction with experiments. The solution properties of these dipole-rich macromolecules depend crucially on the ability of the dipoles to orient and the local dielectric properties of the associations.

Polymer Synthesis. PMPC (1) and PMBP (2) homopolymers and PMPC-b-PMBP (3) diblock copolymers were prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) according to our previous
paper.29 Homopolymerizations were conducted using copper(I) bromide as catalyst, 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) as ligand, and ethyl αbromoisobutyrate (EBiB) as initiator in a [CuBr]:[bpy]:[EBiB] 1:2:1 molar ratio to give polymers 1 and 2. PMPC-b-PMBP (3) was prepared by chain extension of PMPC macroinitiator 1 with MBP monomers. All of the polymers were purified by precipitation in diethyl ether, followed by dialysis in deionized (DI) water. Lyophilization gave the polymer products as white solids. Theoretical molecular weights and number-average degrees of polymerizations (Dp) of the PMPC and PMBP homopolymers were estimated from
monomer conversion, which was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Dp of the extended MBP chain in PMPC-b-PMBP was estimated
using the molar ratio of MPC and MBP in the final product by 1H
NMR,29 which is also consistent with the result calculated by MBP monomer conversion. Molecular weights and polydispersities (PDIs) were estimated by GPC with refractive index detection, employing 1,1,1-trifluoroethanol (TFE, with 0.02 M sodium trifluoroacetate) as the mobile phase.

Here η is the viscosity of the solution, and kBT is the Boltzmann constant times absolute temperature. To characterize the radius of gyration, Rg, second virial coefficient, A2, and the weight-averaged molecular weight, Mw, of soluble
zwitterions in solution, we used the Zimm analysis.36 Four concentrations were prepared for each sample of PMPC of value 10, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 g/L. For each sample, intensity was time averaged for 50 s. For more details see SI. The radius of gyration of the larger PMBP structures in solutions
was determined using the Guinier plot.37 For bimodal solutions the intensity contribution from the larger structures can be obtained from both CONTIN and multiple exponential fits. Similar analysis has been
used in our previous publications.35,38
