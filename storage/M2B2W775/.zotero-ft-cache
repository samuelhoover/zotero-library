The Flory-Huggins interaction parameter,  ̄, for a series of critical binary blends of polyisobutylene and deuterated polybutadiene was measured by small-angle neutron scattering.  ̄ was determined by fitting the scattering intensity profiles single-phase blends to the well-established random-phase approximation. Our experiments, which covered a wide range of chain lengths, suggest that  ̄ depends on both blend composition and the ratio of the homopolymer chain lengths.
Introduction
The Flory-Huggins theory continues to be the starting point for quantifying the interactions between chemically dissimilar polymer chains.1,2 In this theory, the free energy per unit volume for mixing two polymers labeled “1” and “2”, ∆Gm, is
where φ1 is the volume fraction of component 1 in the mixture, V is a reference volume which we set equal to 0.1 nm3, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Ni is the number of repeat units per chain of type i (i ) 1, 2), where each repeat unit is assumed to have a volume equal to V. We compute Ni using
where Nˆ i is the number of chemical repeat units in chain i and Vi is the volume of each chemical repeat unit. The volume fraction of component 1 at the critical point is given by
For blends that are in perfect agreement with the FloryHuggins theory,  ̄ should be independent of φ1 and Ni. In many systems, however, this is not the case.3-12 It is generally assumed that  ̄ depends on blend composition but is independent of component molecular weight, i.e.,  ̄(φ1).3-12 This implies that a quantitative understanding of polymer blend thermodynamics will require more sophisticated theories that go beyond the oneparameter Flory-Huggins theory. There is, however, no consensus on how to improve upon the Flory-Huggins theory. Measurements of  ̄ for a chosen pair of polymers are typically made using one set of polymers, i.e., for a particular value of
N1 and N2.13 There are relatively few cases where polymer blend thermodynamics are studied as a function of component molecular weight (e.g., ref 3). In this study we examine a series of blends composed of polymers with Ni ranging from about 200 to 3600. We use small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements from single-phase blends to determine  ̄, as first suggested by de Gennes.14 The SANS technique works best when the blend is at the critical composition, because small changes in  ̄ near the critical point result in large changes in the scattering profile. We thus report data obtained from critical blends, calculated using eq 3 for our polymer pairs.
Experimental Section
Component 1 in the polymer blends was polyisobutylene (PIB), and component 2 was deuterated polybutadiene (dPBD) with 63% 1,2-addition. Deuterated polybutadiene was synthesized via anionic polymerization using techniques described in ref 15. The CdC double bonds were saturated under high pressure using deuterium gas. Polyisobutylene was synthesized via cationic polymerization, also described in ref 15. The polymers used in this study are listed in Table 1. Binary blends were prepared according to the methods described in ref 15. The compositions of the blends studied in this paper are listed in Table 2. Blends are labeled B[x], where x denotes the value of the ratio N1/N2 of the polymers used to make each blend. SANS measurements were made on beamline NG7 at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, MD. The raw data were corrected for detector sensitivity, background, empty cell, incoherent scattering, and scattering due to inhomogeneous deuteration using standard methods;16 then they were converted to absolute coherent scattering intensity, I, versus magnitude of the scattering vector, q (q ) 4πsin(θ/2)/λ, where θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of the incident beam).
Results and Discussion
The random-phase approximation (RPA) gives the following expression for the coherent SANS profile, I(q).14

Our procedure for extracting  ̄ from SANS is outlined in ref 16. In Figure 1 we show typical RPA fits through the SANS data obtained from selected blends at 383 K with  ̄ and R as the only adjustable parameters. R is given by R ) l1(T)/l1,std ) l2(T)/l2,std, where li,std are the nominal values for the statistical segment lengths established in the literature;15 l1,std and l2,std are 0.58 and 0.75 nm, respectively. The R values for all of the blends
in the temperature range of 302-474 K were between 0.89 and 1.02. It is evident from Figure 1 that the RPA fits capture all aspects of the SANS profiles. In parts a and b of Figure 2, we show the dependence of  ̄ on φ1 and N1/N2, respectively. Since the blends are at the critical composition, φ1 and N1/N2 are related by eq 3. We use (2φ1 - 1) as the abscissa in Figure 2a for convenience as this quantity is zero when N1/N2 ) 1. For the case of blends with N1/N2 ≈ 1, we see excellent agreement between the  ̄ parameters measured from the different blends. The values of  ̄ obtained from blends B[1.19] and B[0.92] differ by about 10% (which is the typical experimental uncertainty in  ̄ determined by SANS) in spite of the large difference in N1; N1 is 227 for B[1.19] and 1031 for B[0.92]. The N1/N2 ≈ 1 data seem to imply that the thermodynamics of PIB/dPBD blends are in good agreement with the Flory-Huggins theory. However, the  ̄ parameters measured from blends with N1/N2 values that are

significantly different from unity show departures from the values obtained when N1/N2 ≈ 1. Values obtained from blends with N1/N2 < 1.0 are systematically smaller than those obtained from N1/N2 > 1.0. These general observations hold for all of the temperatures that were examined (Figure 2). The lines in Figure 2 are least-squares linear fits through the data, and the results of the fits are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. The data in Figure 2 thus suggest that  ̄ may, in fact, be a function of two variables, φ1 and N1/N2. The dependence on φ1 is similar to that reported in polystyrene/polyvinylmethyl ether blends,3 where it has been argued that compressibility effects are responsible for the linear composition dependence.12 It is conceivable that similar effects are responsible for the composition dependence of  ̄ in PIB/dPBD blends. The theoretical work in ref 12 also suggests that compressibility effects cause the measured  ̄ to depend on molecular weight. It is clear that further experimental work, wherein both φ1 and N1/N2 are varied independently, is needed to establish the variables that affect the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter. Finally, it is worth noting that the compositions of the critical blends studied here were calculated on the assumption that  ̄ is independent of φ1, N1, and N2. The proximity of the blends to the true critical composition will have to be reevaluated after all of the variables that affect  ̄ have been identified.
