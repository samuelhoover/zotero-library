Available online 23 June 2016 Sandcastle worms, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes), live along the western coast of North America. Individual worms build tubular shells under seawater by gluing together sandgrains and biomineral particles with a multipart, rapid-set, self-initiating adhesive. The glue comprises distinct sets of condensed, oppositely charged polyelectrolytic components—polyphosphates, polysulfates, and polyamines—that are separately granulated and stored at high concentration in distinct cell types. The pre-organized adhesive modules are secreted separately and intact, but rapidly fuse with minimal mixing and expand into a crack-penetrating complex fluid. Within 30 s of secretion into seawater, the fluid adhesive transitions (sets) into a porous solid adhesive joint. The nano- and microporous structure of the foamy solid adhesive contributes to the strength and toughness of the adhesive joint through several mechanisms. A curing agent (catechol oxidase), co-packaged into both types of adhesive granules, covalently cross-links the adhesive and becomes a structural component of the final adhesive joint. The overall effectiveness of the granulated sandcastle glue is more a product of the cellular sorting and packaging mechanisms, the transition from fluid to solid following secretion, and its final biphasic porous structure as it is of its composition or any particular amino acid modification. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction
Reef-building sandcastle worms, and related Sabellariidae polycheates,1 use underwater glue on a massive scale to geoengineer the world's coastlines. Glued together sabellariid reefs can extend continuously for hundreds of kilometers parallel to temperate shorelines worldwide (Fig. 1A) [1,2]. The intertidal structures resist wave erosion
of the beach, filter and trap sediments, and shelter a rich fauna within the vicinity of the reef [3,4]. Compaction of dead reefs extends the beach's foundation seaward and provides a hard base for new colonies [1]. The reefs are glued together one grain of sand at a time. Individual worms meticulously construct tubular shells around their bodies with a secreted bioadhesive and sandgrains or shell fragments captured with ciliated tentacles from the turbulent water column (Fig. 1B,C) [5]. In addition to holding the reef together, the glue contains settlement cues that induce planktonic conspecific larva to attach, undergo metamorphosis, and initiate the construction of new tubes on existing tubes, thus enlarging the honeycomb-like sandcastle reefs [6]. The sandcastle worm glue is distinguished from other marine adhesives by the high charge density of its polyelectrolytic components, and

by the segregation of positive and negative charges into separate macromolecules. These observations led to the suggestion that the phenomenon of complex coacervation—the spontaneous associative separation of oppositely charged macromolecules into two liquid phases—may play a role in the formation of the adhesive [7]. Complex coacervation has a long history in the field of cell biology. Famously, the spontaneous concentration of primordial organic macromolecules into coacervate protocells was proposed as an intermediate step in the abiotic origin of living cells [8]. In contemporary cell biology, complex coacervation is experiencing a renaissance as a result of the recognition that liquid–liquid phase separation creates transient, phase-defined compartments within the cytoplasm [9]. Several examples of abrupt phase transitions of cellular macromolecules, which create switch-like reorganization of the cytoplasm in response to external stimuli, have been recently reported [10–13]. Regulated secretion is another cellular process in which the complex coacervation phenomenon may play a fundamental role. Electrostatic condensation of polyelectrolytic macromolecules into dense fluid
granules is a perfect mechanism for packaging and storing large quantities of charged macromolecules, including bioadhesives, that are destined to be secreted in a fluid state in response to a specific signal. Distinct from complex coacervation for sub-cellular compartmentalization, complex coacervation in the regulated secretory system occurs in a membrane delimited compartment, within which energetic processes control the pH, ion species, ion concentrations, and water content to promote condensation of macromolecules into secretory granules. Secreted biomacromolecules, therefore, are co-adapted both for their extracellular function and for storage within and transit through the regulated secretory pathway, which means they must have suitable physicochemical characteristics for reversible condensation into granules. The primary focus of this review is the natural sandcastle worm adhesive system. We begin with the morphology of the adhesive gland, then describe the packaging of the bioadhesive precursors into multiple types of granules, the application of the granulated adhesive to the substrate, the events of the first few seconds after delivery, and the set and cure mechanisms that lead to the final structure of the solid foam

adhesive. We discuss the role of coacervation in adhesive packaging, phase transitions during the setting reactions, changes in glue morphology during these processes, and the enzyme-catalyzed curing mechanism. Biomimetic adhesives inspired by the sandcastle worm are not a major focus. For recent and comprehensive reviews of other natural adhesives see reference [47] and references therein.
2. Adhesive gland morphology
The gland tissue that produces the sandcastle glue is clustered within the coelomic cavity of the first three parathoracic segments (Fig. 2A,B). As first described by Vovelle [14], the gland comprises two major cell types that produce either “homogeneous” or “heterogeneous” secretory granules, which are visually distinguished by their morphology and differential staining [15,16]. Heterogeneous granules have a mottled appearance due to the presence of sub-granules and stain darker blue with toluidine blue (TB) than homogeneous granules, which appear uniform (Fig. 2C).
Each secretory cell is packed with hundreds or thousands of adhesive granules stored for rapid delivery on demand. The secretory cells are connected to the building organ by long axon-like cellular extensions through which the secretory granules are transported in single file to the surface of the building organ (Fig. 2D,E). The heterogeneous and homogeneous granules, parked just below the surface around the entire circumference of the building organ, remain intact and separated from one another. Each secretory cell delivers its granulated contents directly to the surface of the building organ—the separate and distinct adhesive parts are not mixed within the adhesive gland or building organ [15,17].
3. Adhesive components and packaging
Sandcastle glue is made of oppositely charged macromolecules distributed in unique pairs between the two types of secretory granules (Table 1) [18]. The glue proteins Pc1, 2, 4, 5 are polycations enriched in lysine (K), histidine (H), glycine (G), and tyrosine residues [19]. The tyrosine residues of Pc1 and Pc2 are post-translationally hydroxylated to form dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) [20]. Pc2 and Pc5 are located only in the homogeneous granules along with sulfated polyanions that may counterbalance their charge [21]. Pc1 and 4 are located only in the heterogeneous granules along with polyanionic Pc3A, Pc3B, and Mg2+ ions. Both granules contain catechol oxidase that catalyzes cross-linking of DOPA side chains [21]. Homologs of the Phragmatopoma californica bioadhesive proteins have been identified in Sabellaria alveolata, a tube-building sabellariid found along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe [16]. The extremely phosphorylated Pc3 proteins are the most unusual components of the sandcastle worm glue compared to other characterized underwater adhesives. Pc3B consists entirely of 6- to 12-residue phosphoserine (pS) blocks separated by single Y residues (Fig. 3A).

Pc3A has an N-terminal pS-rich block and a C-terminal block of roughly equal size enriched in K and arginine (R) residues (Fig. 3B) [7,19,22]. Quantitative energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of sectioned adhesive glands revealed that phosphorus, and therefore the Pc3A and Pc3B proteins, occur exclusively in the sub-granules of the heterogeneous granules, co-localized with approximately 0.5 Mg2+ ions per phosphate group (Fig. 3 C,D) [23]. Only background levels of Ca were detected in the heterogeneous granules and sub-granules. The pH of the adhesive granules has not been measured and the pKa2 of the phosphate groups is unknown, which makes a precise accounting of charge balance impossible. Nevertheless, if the phosphates are monoanionic, the concentration of Mg2+ ions are sufficient to balance the negative charges on the phosphates. The R-rich cationic block of Pc3A would also contribute to phosphate charge neutralization within the heterogeneous sub-granules. The high concentration of Mg2+ also implies the presence of a Mg2+ ion transporter responsible for concentrating Mg2+ within the heterogeneous granules. The form, fluid or solid, of the condensed polyphosphates in the heterogeneous sub-granules within the adhesive gland has not been determined experimentally. However, synthetic methacrylates copolymers that mimic Pc3B (Fig. 4A) with ~ 70 mol% phosphate side chains (pPEMA70) form clear homogeneous coacervates when mixed with Mg2+ ions at pH 8.4 and temperatures less than 20 °C (Fig. 4B,C) [24]. Coacervation of pPEMA and Mg2+ is not affected by salinity; coacervate volume is constant in NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 3.0 M (not shown). A complete description of the simple coacervation of synthetic pPEMA with Mg2+ will be reported elsewhere since the primary topic of this paper is the natural adhesive. The demonstration that Mg2+/ pPEMA forms clear homogeneous fluid coacervates (Fig. 4C) at the temperature and salinity of the ocean provides empirical evidence that it is physicochemically possible that the heterogenous sub-granules of Mg2+ and Pc3A/B are stored as fluid coacervates within the secretory pathway, and are in a fluid state at the time of secretion.
4. Adhesive delivery
The sightless animals depend on the so-called building organ, a dexterous pair of opposed finger-like appendages just below the mouth, for constructing their tubular shells (Fig. 5A). Suspended sandgrains and shell fragments are collected by ciliated tentacles from the water column and transported to the building organ for evaluation. Mineral particles of suitable size (~ 0.5 mm), shape, and surface chemistry are pinched within the building organ “fingers”, carefully positioned onto the end of the tube, and held in place to minimize gaps. Minutes dabs of glue are then applied from the building organ into the narrow gap where particles are in contact. The glue emanates from microscopic pores in the ciliated surface distributed around the entire circumference of the building organ (Fig. 5B,C). The pores frequently occur in close pairs, tempting speculation that one pore is the exit point of a
homogeneous cell and the other pore the exit for a heterogeneous cell. Secretion of the two granule types in close proximity to one another would insure uniform distribution within the glue of the separated adhesive parts, with minimal mixing, during application to the substrate [17,23]. When worms rebuild their tubes in the laboratory with spherical glass beads, the glue is applied only where the beads are in contact and at all contact points (Fig. 6A). The supplemental video (Video S1) reveals how this is accomplished. The worms simultaneously apply two separate aliquots of glue into the two contact sites between three glass beads. The glue is applied from the side of the contact site and wicks into the narrow gap between the beads forming a concave capillary bridge (Fig. 10A). Adhesion of the fluid to the glass surface in seawater is evident from the much less than 90° contact angles of the adhesive with the bead surface. The capillary bridge that forms between the particles provides an immediate attractive normal force between the beads. The capillary force has two components: a Laplace pressure difference across the interface between glue and seawater and the interfacial tension that minimizes the interfacial area [25,26]. From the concave surface of the glue joints, the Laplace pressure is lower in the glue phase than in surrounding aqueous phase, which contributes to the normal attractive force. The fluid bridge, however, would contribute little to the compressive or shear moduli of the joint. When worms were electrically stimulated to secrete adhesive, the granules were intact when they exited through the surface of the building organ (Fig. 6) [15,23]. Soon thereafter the granules rupture and the contents fuse with little mixing into a lumpy crack-penetrating fluid [23]. What triggers rupture of the granules after secretion? To investigate, intact granules isolated from dissected adhesive gland tissue in modified Ringer's buffer (430 mM NaCl,10 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 50 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Tris, pH 6.5) were surface immobilized in a microscope flow chamber. Solution conditions were then changed to determine if environmental changes caused granule rupture. In seawater, the granules remained intact and their diameter was unchanged. Therefore, differences in pH, ionic strength, or ionic composition between the interior of the adhesive granules and seawater alone do not trigger granule swelling or rupture (Fig. 7A,B). Likewise, the granules did not swell and rupture in low ionic strength distilled water (Fig. 7C,D). However, in the anionic detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), the granules ruptured and internal vacuoles appeared as the granules rapidly swelled into foamy spheres with roughly two-fold greater diameter than the intact granules (Fig. 7E,F). The swelling was limited as though the swelling forces were balanced by a cross-linked network in the adhesive matrix. Hence, each granule appeared to be a pre-organized, preassembled foamy module of the final adhesive that swelled to a fixed extent. This is consistent with the occasional appearance of what appear to be individual granules separated from the main adhesive mass, but which have the porous structure of the bulk adhesive (Fig. 10B, white arrow).

Addition of ATP to the flow chamber had a pronounced affect on the granule morphology that was distinct from the effect of SDS. The granules swelled until they ruptured, and appeared to lose their contents as they shrank back to less than the original diameter (Fig. 8A–C). Within 60 s, the granules appeared to be collapsed, empty shells. The granule response was specific to ATP since GTP had no affect on the granules (Fig. 8D–F). The volume and morphological response to ATP suggests there is an ATPase present in the granules membranes. A likely candidate is a vacuolar H+-ATPase, a group of highly conserved and widely distributed transmembrane enzymes that hydrolyze ATP to pump protons across membranes in eukaryotic cells, including secretory vesicle membranes [27]. The transmembrane H+ gradients generated by H+
ATPases, in turn, power transmembrane anti-porters that concentrate components into membrane compartments [28]. The high concentration of Mg2+ ions associated with the Pc3A/B coacervates may be transported across the secretory vesicle membranes and concentrated within the secretory granule power a H+/Mg2+ anti-porter. When a high concentration of ATP was added to isolated granules (Fig. 8A–C), the H+-ATPase may have over-acidified the interior of the granules, thus dissolving the coacervated contents, increasing the osmotic pressure within the granules, causing them to burst and release the dissolved contents. Addition of ATP to isolated granules caused them to rupture, but this is not likely the natural mechanism that ruptures and fuses the granules

moments after they are secreted into seawater. Rupture is also not caused by changes in solution conditions, such as pH, upon exposure to seawater (Fig. 7A,B). Instead, the granules may be ruptured mechanically by beating of the dense clusters of unique paddle-ended cilia on the surface of the building organ in immediate proximity to the exit pores (Fig. 5D) [15,23]. The worms also apply a back and forth twisting motion while the adhesive is being injected into the gaps of new particles, which may also contribute to mechanical rupture of the granules [17]. Experimentally, when isolated granules were gently sheared between two glass coverslips in seawater, then examined by SEM, the granules were ruptured, had a foamy appearance, and were fused with other granules while largely maintaining their individual integrity (Fig. 9A,B). In other words, there was little mixing of the granule contents; each granule was a preformed adhesive module fused into the final bulk adhesive. Mechanical rupture of the granules appears to be a plausible mechanism of forming the liquid adhesive immediately after intact granules are secreted. The investigation of bioadhesives in isolated intact granules is a promising experimental approach that allows adhesive proteins and other adhesive components to be studied as packaged with their natural counterparts in their natural form, rather than in isolation. Although the results presented here are preliminary, they demonstrate that adhesive packaging is an energetic cellular process; a transmembrane ATPase controls the environment inside the adhesive packages, such as pH and secondarily ion content. This cellular control is likely critical to concentrating the adhesives into granules and controlling their state of matter, such as in the form of fluid coacervates. Understanding the mechanistic details of adhesive packaging and unpackaging is crucial to understanding the sandcastle worm adhesive system, and any natural adhesive system for that matter.
5. Setting and toughening mechanisms
Capillary forces can provide an immediate attractive normal force, but to efficiently create a bond that bears shear and compressive loads between mineral particles the crack-penetrating liquid adhesive must quickly solidify and harden after application. In a laboratory aquarium,

worms gluing sand grains, glass beads, or bone chips to their tubes slightly wiggled the particles as they were held in place with the building organ as adhesive was applied. The particles were consistently released by the building organ in less than 30 s. From these observations, we inferred that the initial solidification, or set, was sufficient in less than 30 s for the particles to be self-supporting in the worm's turbulent environment [17]. The transition of the sandcastle glue from a complex fluid to a porous solid–liquid foam with a surface skin and mostly closed cell architecture is triggered by seawater. This is not as simple as the well-known phase inversion processes used to make porous membranes or filaments whereby polymers or polyelectrolytes in a good solvent are cast or printed into a coagulation bath of poor solvent [29–31]. Looking closely, the closed cells of the glue originate almost entirely from the Mg2+/polyphosphate sub-granules of the heterogeneous adhesive packets (Fig. 10E,F), an observation also reported by Vovelle [14]. The cells are bounded by chemically distinct, well-defined shells and are embedded in a continuous
nanoparticulate, nanoporous matrix [17]. Super-resolution microscopy [32] of resin embedded and thin sectioned glue using fluorescent antipS antibodies revealed that the polyphosphorylated Pc3/B proteins are highly concentrated in the distinct walls of the cells. It appears that during the phase transition to a solid adhesive, the coacervated Mg2+/ polyphosphate in the heterogeneous sub-granules swells and becomes the solid walls of fluid-filled hollow cells [21]. The cells, with an average diameter of 2 μm, are several fold larger in diameter than the subgranules [17]. The disposition of the phospholipids from granule membranes in the final adhesive is unknown. The seawater induced phase transition is driven by a substantial pH differential between the regulated secretory system (pH b6) and the ocean (pH N 8) as well as changes in ionic composition. In the subgranules, the polyphosphates are complexed with Mg2+ only (Fig. 3D), whereas the final adhesive contains both Mg2+ and Ca2+ in a 4:1 M ratio [33]. Both the increase in pH and exchange of Mg2+ with Ca2+ would contribute to insolubilization of the polyphosphates [34]. Granule

rupture is accompanied by limited swelling, which may be driven by Donnan osmotic pressure that arises from an increase in the internal fixed charge density of the adhesive at the higher pH of seawater. In particular, the phosphates may transition from mono- to dianionic if the internal and external pH differential spans pKa2. Granule swelling may be limited by a cross-linked network in the matrix around the cells. The osmotic pressure would contribute substantially to the compressive and shear moduli of the set glue, and would also pre-stress the walls around the closed cells and the matrix network, further strengthening the joint [35]. During strain, restricted movement of water through the permeable nanoporous matrix may provide a viscous energy dispersive mechanism that further toughens the joint [36]. In other words, the sandcastle glue is an adhesive structure, not simply an adhesive material [17]. The sandcastle glue structure, toughening mechanisms, and the phase inversion mechanisms that give rise to them can be built into synthetic underwater adhesives [37]. As an example, we have recently copied the environmentally triggered coacervate phase transitions of the sandcastle glue to create waterborne in situ setting liquid embolic agents [38]. Such agents are widely used in the clinic for minimally invasive control of blood flow. Applications include treatment of arteriovenous malformations, pre-surgical devascularization of tumors, and traumatic hemorrhage control, to name a few [39,40]. Shear thinning, low viscosity complex coacervates were prepared in hypertonic saline to allow delivery through long, narrow gauge, transarterial catheters. The fluid complex coacervates adhere strongly to blood vessel walls, which allows precise placement of the embolic agent. As they equilibrate toward physiological ionic strength, the embolic coacervates transition into ionic gels as the electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes become less shielded by counter ions. The adherent gels occlude the blood vessel and block the flow of blood [38]. The transition from fluid to gel is accompanied by the formation of a discontinuous porous phase (Fig. 11). As described earlier for the fluidfilled multiphasic structure of the natural sandcastle glue (Fig. 10D), the phase inversion mechanism and the resulting porous structure of the in situ setting embolic coacervates may contribute osmotic prestressing and hydraulic toughening mechanisms to the set adhesive. A more complete description of the ionic strength induced phase inversion of the embolic coacervates, their final structure, and material properties will be presented elsewhere.
6. Curing mechanism
The sandcastle glue turns reddish brown, indicative of quinonic cross-linking, over the course of a few hours after secretion [17]. Covalent cross-linking, or curing, of the adhesive provides additional strength to the joint. Covalent curing is catalyzed by a catechol oxidase enzyme that is co-packaged into both the homogeneous and heterogeneous granules [21]. Catechol oxidases are type 3 copper proteins with binuclear Cu active sites that catalyze oxidation of diphenols [41]. The Cu concentration in the sandcastle glue is 0.7 ppm, which is many orders of magnitude higher than the Cu concentration in natural seawater [42]. Therefore, the Cu is most likely present in the adhesive before secretion in the active site of the catechol oxidase. If so, the high Cu content suggests that catechol oxidase is a major protein constituent of the adhesive joints. The ratio of Cu to P is approximately 1:2000, which corresponds to a ratio of catechol oxidase to Pc3A/B on the order of 1:10, estimating that on average Pc3A/B have approximately 100 phosphate groups and catechol oxidase has two copper atoms. The high concentration of enzyme co-packaged within both types of micron-sized packets ensures rapid and homogeneous cross-linking of the modular, multipart adhesive without the need for the enzyme to diffuse through or be mixed into the adhesive. The enzyme remains embedded and active within the glue long after the glue has fully cured [21]. As a major constituent of the glue, the catechol oxidase enzyme is likely also an integral structural element of the glue. We have theorized that complex coacervation may also play a role in the regulation of the catechol oxidase enzyme [18]. The pro-enzyme contains a 74 amino acid pro-peptide, which is unstructured and polyampholytic; 31 of 74 residues are charged at neutral pH. It is possible that the enzyme is electrostatically inactivated before secretion by association of the propeptide with the other polyelectrolytic components in the secretory granules. The highly charged propeptide could also play a role in electrostatically condensing the latent catechol oxidase into the granulated adhesive. Upon granule lysis in seawater, the enzyme may be activated by exchange and rearrangement of electrostatic associations. There are numerous examples of latent plant catechol oxidases that are activated by anionic detergents that bind specific sites of the enzyme [43]. These precedents provide empirical evidence that electrostatic interactions can reversibly switch enzymes on and off.
7. Summary
Sandcastle worms construct reefs under turbulent seawater by joining irregularly shaped particles into external tubular structures. The nature of the process requires a waterborne fluid adhesive, denser than seawater, that will penetrate the narrow spaces between closely opposed particles while not dissolving into the ocean. The fluid adhesive provides an immediate capillary force between the particles, but must rapidly transition into a solid state to resist shear and compressive forces in the turbulent environment. To accomplish this feat, the sandcastle glue is granulated under energetic cellular control into two types of pre-formed, pre-organized adhesive modules. During secretion, the granules rupture and fuse into a crack-penetrating fluid adhesive. Seawater is a poor solvent for the adhesive, which leads to rapid hardening of the coacervate from the outside inward through microphase separation and insolubilization of the adhesive components into a solid–liquid foam. Co-packaged latent catechol oxidase provides a built-in selfinitiated covalent curing mechanism. The undersea glue of the sandcastle worm has inspired the design of wet field medical adhesives [34,37,38, 44–47]. Additional characterization of the environmentally triggered setting mechanisms and multiphasic structure of the sandcastle glue will provide additional insights into the design and manufacture of novel underwater setting nano- and micro-structured adhesives, paints, and membranes.
