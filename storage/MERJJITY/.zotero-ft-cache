Advances in synthetic chemistry have led to greater control over the sequence of polymeric materials, and the ability to create patterns whose complexity is reminiscent of that of biological macromolecules. In random copolymers synthesized via statistical copolymerization, the sequence follows a first-order Markov chain process governed by the underlying reactivity ratios. In this work, theory and simulations are combined to study the role of sequence in the complex coacervation of oppositely charged random (co) polyelectrolytes, i.e. copolymers comprising cationic/anionic and neutral monomers. It is found that charged monomers enhance the proclivity towards complex coacervation, and enhance the coacervates' stability upon addition of salt. This result is general, and holds for both good and poor solvents, despite the different (“closed” and “open”) shapes of the respective coacervation binodals. For high charge blockiness, simulations reveal the formation of microphase separated coacervates consisting of domains rich in ionic or neutral monomers. The transition from homogeneous to locally segregated coacervates leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the density on charge blockiness. Our results provide a comprehensive framework to understand and interpret the effects of sequence on complex coacervation, and for rational design of coacervate-based materials.

Design, System, Application
Polyelectrolyte complex coacervates are macroscopic polymer-rich phases that form in the solutions of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes as the result of their coulombic attractions. In addition to the practical applications such as emulsifiers, viscosity modifiers, and underwater adhesive, complex coacervates are also considered as a simple model of membraneless organelles existing within the living cells. Our work utilizes both theory and coarse-grained simulations to understand how liquid–liquid phase separation into polyelectrolyte complex coacervate and highly diluted supernatant can be controlled at the molecular level, through the primary sequence of ionic and neutral monomers in the polyelectrolytes. We consider the particular case of random polyelectrolytes that can be synthesized via statistical copolymerization of neutral and ionic (co)monomers and demonstrate how the synthesis conditions can be varied to tune the monomer sequences and, therefore, coacervate internal structure and stability. Our computational and theoretical results provide a comprehensive framework to guide the molecular design of coacervate-based materials with desired properties via engineering the primary sequence of polyelectrolytes.

Sequence plays a key role in determining the physical properties of synthetic or biological macromolecular materials.1,2 In folded proteins, the amino acid residue types (one out of 20) and their linear sequence serve to determine the conformation and functionality of a molecule. In

intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), a subclass of proteins that lack the ability to form secondary and higher-ordered structures, it is also the sequence of charged monomers that determines the phase behavior in solution,3 and the formation and structure of membraneless organelles.4,5 Recent studies with synthetic materials have established that sequence can be utilized to tune the behavior of polymer systems, including single-chain heteropolymers and their microphase-separated melts, or solutions of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes or polyampholytes.2,6–11 The physical principles that encode a particular type of behavior into the sequence of a polyelectrolyte are not fully understood and, when fully unveiled, there should be opportunities to generalize their application for design of broader classes of materials.

Paper
In this work, we rely on theory and simulations to develop a general framework for design of sequence in oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PEs). The sequence of charged and neutral monomers in PEs affects the magnitude of charge correlations and the resulting electrostatic attraction between polyanions and polycations. Therefore, the macroscopic phase separation into a polymer-poor supernatant and a polymer-rich PE complex coacervate depends on sequence. This system is analogous to solutions of IDPs (which are biopolyampholytes), where the driving force for the liquid–liquid separation are Coulombic interactions between oppositely charged monomers. For IDPs, phase separation is also referred to as self-coacervation, because oppositely charged monomers belong to the same chains that constitute the polymer-rich phase. In contrast, PE complex coacervates comprise two types of chains, polyanions and polycations. As discussed here and in the literature, given the similarity in the formation mechanism of complex and self-coacervates, the sequence specificity that is observed in the phase behavior of IDP solutions5 also arises in PE complex coacervation.7,12
Recent theoretical and simulation studies have considered the similarities between sequence-dependent coacervation in PEs7,12 and IDPs.10,13–16 It is worth pointing out that even simple models of IDPs, which represent polyampholytes as chains of identical positively and negatively charged monomers,10,13–16 have been very successful in revealing the role of primary sequence on coacervation.17,18 One of the key findings of past work has been that, for a fixed total length and composition of a polyampholyte, increasing the length of the charged blocks of positively and negatively charged monomers leads to a greater propensity for coacervation – an effect that is universal for different types of sequences.10,13–16 Similar conclusions have been drawn in ref. 7 and 12 for complex coacervation between oppositely charged polypeptides consisting of alternating blocks of neutral and charged monomers. The longer the block length τ, the denser the resulting polyelectrolyte complex coacervate, and the higher its salt resistance.7 Ref. 7 and 12 are devoted to complex coacervation between sequence-monodisperse polyanions and polycations, and it is of interest to point out the extent to which their conclusions hold for ensembles of PEs having different sequence realizations governed by statistical laws, i.e. for sequence-polydisperse complex coacervation.
In this work, we examine sequence-dependent complex coacervation in statistical PEs. We build on a theoretical framework proposed in our earlier work,19 and we use simulations to validate the general predictions of that framework. Statistical PEs, which are also referred to as random correlated (co)PEs, can be synthesized via chain copolymerization of (i) neutral and charged monomers20,21 or (ii) two neutral monomers followed by post-polymerization functionalization to provide ionization of one of them, e.g., using “click” chemistry approaches.17,22,23 Charged and neutral monomers are denoted by ± and 0, respectively. For low conversion, when compositional drift is negligible,24,25 the statistics of these PEs (e.g. polycations) follows a firstorder Markov process with a transition matrix given by

described in sections II and III. Section VI discusses our results. The first part is focused on the sequence-dependent behavior of homogeneous coacervates, including the effect of the sequence asymmetry between polyanions and polycations (λ+ ≠ λ−) and the role of the solvent quality. We also outline how experiments could be designed to study the predicted effects. The second part, subsection IV.2, is devoted to the formation of inhomogeneous coacervates, and the analysis of their internal microphase separated structure. Section V provides a summary of our main findings.
II Theoretical framework

We consider a solution of long flexible oppositely charged

PEs containing N+ = N− = N ≫ 1 statistical segments, each of length a. The fraction of charged monomers in the

polyanions and polycations is denoted by f+ and f−, and their primary sequences are Markov processes with the nontrivial

eigenvalues of the transition matrices P± equal to λ±.
We start with a salt-free solution, and use a random phase approximation formalism (RPA)39–42 to find the free energy

III Computer simulations

The traditional Kremer–Grest model51 is used to represent random coPEs in implicit solvent. Specifically, PE chains are represented by spherical interaction sites or beads connected by springs. Salt is modeled by individual charged beads. The solvent is included implicitly for computational efficiency. As a result, the solvent conditions are controlled by the non-bonded interactions between monomers. In our simulation, we examine two solvent conditions: good (athermal) solvent and poor solvent. The system contains an equal number of polyanions and polycations with chain length N = 100. Both polyanions and polycations consist of charged and neutral monomers, and the monomer sequence is assigned by a Markov process based on the Markov transition matrix P± for given λ± and f± values. To ensure the electroneutrality of the system, we generate the chains according to the Markov process and retain only those whose fraction of charged monomers is exactly equal to the predetermined f± (this restriction

where ε describes the strength of interaction, rc is the cutoff radius, and σi is the bead diameter. Here i = + is positively charged, − is negatively charged, and n is neutral.
To take into account that neutral beads lack hydration
shells, the neutral beads in our simulation have a smaller radius than the charged beads.7 Specifically, σ+ = σ− = 4σn = σ, where the mixing rule for LJ potentials between neutral and charged beads is of the Lorentz–Berthelot form.7 For good
solvent conditions, the LJ potential for non-bonded beads is truncated at the minimum rc = 21/6σi (i = +, −, n) with ε = kBT. Namely, all beads repel each other. For poor solvent conditions, monomer–salt and salt–salt interactions are also truncated at the minimum rc = 21/6σi (i = +, −) with ε = kBT, while non-bonded monomer–monomer interactions are given by a full LJ potential with rc = 2.5σi (i = +, −, n) and ε = 0.2kBT. Thus, polymer chains can collapse in the absence of
Coulomb interactions.

where the system is maintained at osmotic pressure p = 0 through a Berendsen barostat46,54 and constant temperature is maintained by coupling the system to a Langevin heat bath with damping parameter Γ = 1.0 m/τLJ. Small and large systems containing 50 and 1900 chains, respectively, are considered. The resulting coacervate densities for small and large systems are very close. Simulations of large systems are performed to calculate the structure factor of the coacervates, S(q), and extend the range of the available wave vectors to lower q values. Equilibrium is ascertained by monitoring the convergence of coacervate density and the decay of end-toend vector autocorrelation function as a function of simulation time.46,54 The results and uncertainties are measured after equilibrium by a block average analysis. Visualization of simulations is carried out with the OVITO visualisation package.55
As salt ions are added, the equilibrium between supernatant and coacervate phases is established by using a hybrid MC/MD Gibbs ensemble simulation.56 To further simplify the simulation, we assume there is a negligible amount of polymer in the supernatant phase, which is strictly valid when the salt concentration is not too close to the critical salt concentration.57,58 To simulate two phases, we use two boxes where one box contains salt beads to represent the supernatant phase and another box that contains polymer and salt beads to represent the coacervate phase. The simulation of the two phases consists of randomly choosing one of three events: (i) an MD run with Langevin thermostat to relax the system; (ii) a volume exchange move between two boxes; (iii) a particle transfer move, where a pair of oppositely charged salt beads is transferred from one box to another. The acceptance criteria for (ii) and (iii) correspond to the traditional NVT Gibbs ensemble simulation method.59 A more detailed description of this method can be found in ref. 56. The combined volume of the two boxes in the simulation ranges from 54 000σ3 to 120 000σ3, thereby ensuring that each phase has enough volume. The total number of copolymer chains in the coacervate phase is set to 50. The initial polymer configuration is generated by a self-avoiding random walk.

For the same initial average polymer and salt concentrations, two independent simulations are conducted with the same combined volume, total number of particles, and same monomer sequence, but different initial box volumes for the supernatant and coacervate phases. One run starts with an initial coacervate density larger than the equilibrium density, while another run starts with initial coacervate density smaller than the equilibrium density. The agreement between the results from these two runs serves to establish the selfconsistency of our Gibbs ensemble simulations.
VI Results and discussion
VI.1 Homogeneous coacervate
We first consider the role of primary sequences of charged and neutral monomers on the solution phase behavior. We start with the simplest case, namely that of fully symmetric coacervates. Fig. 1 shows binodals for a solution of polyanions and polycations with equal average content of ionic monomers, f+ = f−, and identical charge statistics, λ+ = λ−. Theory and simulations demonstrate that the higher the λ value, the wider the region of complex coacervation. Increasing the patchiness of charges results in stronger Coulomb attractions, as seen from our theory, eqn (12) and (15). We attribute this to the stronger charge correlations, i.e., to the higher cooperativity of interactions between opposite charges. The latter causes higher densities of salt-free coacervates and higher salt resistance for increasing λ.
In contrast to Fig. 1, which shows the characteristic solution phase behavior of oppositely charged hydrophilic PEs (i.e., under Θ and good solvent conditions), Fig. 2 represents coacervation binodals for their hydrophobic counterparts. In poor solvents, complex coacervation cannot be suppressed by the addition of salt because of the shortrange non-electrostatic (hydrophobic) attractions. This “open” shape of the coacervation binodals is anticipated by theory,47 and has been observed experimentally in solutions of synthetic polyelectrolytes with aliphatic backbones, namely poly(acrylic acid) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride).48 The addition of salt leads to decreasing

coacervate density, but not to complete dissolution. At high salt concentrations, when Coulomb interactions are strongly screened by salt, coacervate density ϕ approaches the density ϕn of the polymer-rich phase in the corresponding solution of neutral polymers. The values of ϕn found theoretically and in simulations are shown in Fig. 2 with dashed lines.
In the context of the role of sequence, the coacervate branch of the binodals shifts to the right as λ increases. Note that the charge blockiness has a noticeable effect on the coacervate density even at high salt concentrations, despite ϕ tends to ϕn for any charge statistics as cs increases. This is another manifestation of the stronger charge correlations within the coacervate at high λ. Higher salt concentrations are required to fully screen Coulomb attractions between clusters of opposite charge, which exist at high λ and can be effectively viewed as multivalent ions, as compared to attractions between single charges (univalent ions) that are distributed in an almost equidistant manner along the polyelectrolytes at λ ≈ −1. For high λ values, ϕ approaches ϕn very slowly because the charge clusters are sufficiently large and their concentration is high as compared to the Θ solvent case due to hydrophobic interactions.

The effects of the charge statistics observed for sequence

symmetric coacervates, λ+ = λ− = λ, is evident because the

charge clustering increases simultaneously in polyanions and

polycations as λ increases. The more interesting case of

sequence-asymmetric coacervates is shown in Fig. 3. Here the

sum λ+ + λ− = p++ + p00 + p−− + p00 − 2 is fixed (to 0.6), and an increase in λ+ is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in λ−. Both theoretical and simulation binodals demonstrate

that a high sequence asymmetry facilitates associative phase

separation. This result is rationalized by eqn (18), which

defines the effective measure of the charge blockiness Λ in

sequence asymmetric (and charge symmetric, f+ = f−) coacervates with unequal λ+ and λ−. Eqn (18) suggests that

the sequence-asymmetric coacervate remains stable in the

same region as its sequence-symmetric counterpart with the

effective λeff given by

At a fixed sum λ+ + λ−, the value of λ+ λ− is the highest, and hence λeff is the lowest for the sequence-symmetric system with λ+ = λ−; these binodals are shown with purple curves in Fig. 3. As the sequence asymmetry given by λ+ − λ− increases,

the two-phase envelope shifts to higher cs values, and the coacervation region broadens.
In experimental studies of complex coacervation for statistical PEs, the simultaneous change of λ+ and λ− can be challenging because it requires precise control of the polymerization process for both polyanions and polycations. From a practical standpoint, the simplest way could be to tune charge statistics in one of the PEs (e.g. polyanion) while keeping the other PE (polycation) unchanged. For instance, the latter can be a homopolycation, while the former can be obtained via statistical copolymerization of neutral and anionic monomers. It is known that the relative reactivity of comonomers can be slightly modified by adjusting the temperature60 or dielectric constant of the solvent.61 If copolymerization is conducted in an aqueous medium, the primary sequences of heteropolyanion can be controlled through changing the ionic strength (i.e., the salt concentration) during synthesis.61 In a salt-free solution, p−− can be expected to be low owing to the repulsion of the negatively charged end unit of the growing chain and the negatively charged monomer. If f− is close to 1/2, one can expect λ− values close to −1, and corresponding to almost alternating statistics of charges for copolymerization in saltfree conditions. However, statistical copolymerization in the presence of salt screening Coulomb repulsions between negatively charged monomers should yield statistics of charges that are much closer to ideally random, λ ≈ 0 (assuming neutral and charged monomers have similar chemistry except for the presence of ionic groups). To achieve even blockier systems, λ > 0, we hypothesize that further adjustments in solvent quality can be made by adding miscible, monomer-selective cosolvents. Recent experimental works62 have demonstrated the non-trivial effects that solvent mixtures and salt combinations can have on modulating salt resistance on oppositely charged PE assemblies, so it is reasonable to anticipate that analogous effects can be induced to affect the pairwise reactivity ratios of charged and neutral monomers. This, however, remains an open-ended question that needs to be explored with experimental kinetics

and characterization of statistical PEs under different salinity and dielectric constant conditions.
Fig. 4 shows the shift of the complex coacervation binodals for charge-asymmetric coacervation, f+ = 2f−, due to the increasing blockiness of the polyanion from λ− = −1 to λ− = 0 for fixed statistics of the polycations. These results correspond to the experimental system containing homopolycations with f+ = 1 and copolyanions with f− = 1/2 and controlled charge statistics. A noticeable shift of the coacervation binodals makes one consider the possibility of the experimental realization of this system, although the difference between the binodals in Fig. 4 is lower than that in Fig. 1 (blue and green curve, λ = −1 and λ = 0), when the blockiness of polyanions and polycations changes simultaneously.
Our preliminary experimental studies indicate that an important challenge is to synthesize heteropolyanions that would not only differ in λ− values but also have very close compositions f− and lengths N−. Since the latter factors strongly affect the position of the binodals,23,48,58,63–65 precise control of f− and N− values is required to isolate and reveal the role of charge blockiness.
VI.2 Inhomogeneous coacervate
The theoretical analysis of Section II suggests that, for sequence- and charge-density-symmetric coacervates, their salt-free densities should increase monotonically with charge patchiness λ. However, the RPA based considerations a priori assume a homogeneous coacervate structure that can be violated at very high λ values, when blocks of charged and neutral monomers are sufficiently long. To overcome this theoretical limitation, we use simulations and consider the coacervate properties in the entire range of λ values, including λ very close to 1. The charge fractions are fixed at f+ = f− = 0.5.
Fig. 5 shows that the coacervate density increases with increasing charge blockiness until λ* ≈ 0.7 and goes down above this threshold (dependencies of the coacervate density

on λ for other sizes of the neutral monomer can be found in ESI,† Fig. S3). Combining this simulation result with the theoretical prediction for the density of homogeneous coacervates, one can conclude that the formation of intracoacervate inhomogeneities is the reason for the nonmonotonous behavior of ϕ(λ). It can be seen in Fig. 6 that, as λ increases, local compositional fluctuations within the coacervate become stronger. Above a certain threshold, domains enriched with charged (blue and red) and neutral (white) monomers appear. The longer the neutral/charged blocks in the PEs, the larger the domains.
Segregation of the coacervate interior into domains enriched with neutral monomers (index “n”) and ionic monomers (index “i”) is driven by their effective incompatibility. Interactions between neutral and neutral/ ionic monomers are purely repulsive, while those between ionic monomers have an additional attractive part due to charge correlations. Each positively charged monomer has more (not belonging to the same chain) neighbors of the opposite charge rather than even charge. Segregation between neutral and ionic monomers can be considered using the corresponding Flory–Huggins parameter

with E being the energy of the corresponding pairwise interactions. In dense systems of opposite charges, Coulomb interactions are screened at distances comparable to the monomer size and become effectively short-range. The above qualitative explanation in terms of χni therefore becomes applicable. Owing to the negative, correlation-induced attractive contribution to Eii, neutral and ionic monomers are effectively immiscible, χni > 0. As high Bjerrum lengths lB lead to stronger Coulomb attractions, χni is an increasing function of lB. We note that ionic domains are charge-balanced and electroneutral because there is no driving force for local segregation between anionic and cations monomers (in contrast to the microphase separation induced by the incompatibility of polyanions and polycations where neighboring domains carry opposite charge47,66–69). The growth of the domains is limited by the lengths of the neutral and charged blocks and their connectivity with each other.
The effective FH parameter χni introduced above facilitates comparison of our system to a melt of random correlated AB copolymers where both A and B monomers are neutral. In the absence of solvent, our coacervate is similar to a melt of statistical copolymers composed of incompatible A and B monomers with fA = fB = 1/2. Mean-field theory predicts that, in the limit of long chains N → ∞, the spinodal of the homogeneous state of the melt is given by26,27,70

and microphase separation is expected above the spinodal.26,27 Eqn (27) demonstrates that the instability of the homogeneous phase can be triggered by either the increasing incompatibility between A and B monomers or the increasing blockiness of like monomers. The latter is consistent with our observations of intra-coacervate (micro) segregation that happens as λ exceeds the threshold value λ* ≈ 0.7. However, the presence of a solvent that is nonuniformly distributed within the microstructured coacervate makes the behavior of our system more complicated as compared to that of a random AB-copolymer melt.

Fig. 7 Partial radial distribution functions g+−(r) of oppositely charged monomers in salt-free coacervates for different λ values from computer simulations. The simulation parameters are given by f+ = f− = 0.5, N = 102, lB/σ = 1.68, and solvent is good for polymer chains. The dashed line indicates g+−(r) = 1.
One can also see that, for symmetric ideally random copolymers with λ = 0 and Λ = 1, the resulting critical value χAB = 2 coincides with that for the mixture of simple lowmolecular weight A and B liquids and is N-independent. In other words, much higher incompatibilities are required to induce microphase separation in random copolymers as compared to regular copolymers (e.g. diblock copolymers where χcArB ∝ 1/N) because any sequence disorder hinders spatial ordering.71,72
The partial radial distribution function (RDF) for oppositely charged monomers g+−(r) shown in Fig. 7 provides a better understanding of the internal structure of the inhomogeneous coacervate. One can see that g+−(r) increases

with increasing sequence correlations, both at λ < λ* when the coacervate is homogeneous and at λ > λ* when it becomes microphase separated. In the latter case, at λ = 0.85 and λ = 0.9, the long tail of the RDF, i.e., g+−(r) values substantially exceeding unity even at r/σ ≥ 3, is indicative of the increasing size of the ionic domains. This effect is also seen in the simulation configuration of Fig. 6. The values of g+−(r) and hence the density of the ionic domains keep growing even at λ > λ*, when the average coacervate density decreases. Therefore, microphase separation within the coacervate is accompanied by the simultaneous uptake of solvent from the supernatant and its nonuniform distribution between ionic and neutral domains with a preference for the latter.
To reveal the internal structure of the inhomogeneous coacervate, we calculate the structure factors Stot(q) and Sm(q) corresponding to the total density of all monomers

ϕtot(r) = ϕn(r) + ϕi(r)

(28)

and to the difference between the densities of neutral and ionic monomers

m(r) = ϕn(r) − ϕi(r)

(29)

Note that m(r) is used to describe the segregation between the ionic and neutral monomers within the coacervate. It is analogous to the order parameter m(r) = ϕA(r) − ϕB(r) defining the local composition and associated with the microphase

separation transition (MST) in the melt of random AB copolymers:27,30 m(r) is zero in the homogeneous melt and nonzero in the spatially structured state.
Fig. 8a shows the dependence of the structure factor Stot(q) of all monomers on λ. At λ < λ* the structure factor is almost independent of the charge blockiness. Above the threshold λ* the values of the structure factor in the low q range increase, signalling the strengthening of the large-scale density fluctuations, i.e., the development of the density inhomogeneities as the result of the MST. This upturn suggests an increase in the osmotic compressibility of the coacervate proportional to Stot(q → 0), and is consistent with the formation of the swollen neutral and dense ionic domains seen in Fig. 6.
All structure factors Stot(q) exhibit a peak at q ≈ 2π/σ due to the covalent connectivity of the monomers, while in the range of lower q, their monotonically decreasing behavior can be approximated by the Ornstein–Zernike (OZ) dependence

This approximation is physically based to the structural
similarity between homogeneous coacervates and semidilute solutions of neutral polymers46,50,73,74 that are well-known to exhibit OZ-type structure factors.75–77 Thus, the fit S(q)−to1t ≈ c1q2 + c2pisﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃuﬃﬃsﬃﬃeﬃ d in order to estimate the correlation length ξtot ¼ c1=c2. One can see in Fig. 8a that this fit is reasonable not only below but also above the threshold λ*. At λ > λ* the deviation of Stot(q) from the OZ functional form given by eqn (30) is seen in the range of small q only, q2 < 0.2. This mismatch is caused
by the MST accompanied by the emergence of the
microdomain structure, i.e., large-scale density inhomogeneities. In this case, the resulting value of ξtot can be considered as the correlation length averaged over
all the domains. One can expect that the local correlation

These results are obtained via fitting the structure factors Stot(q) and

Sm(q) found in simulations and shown in Zernike function: S−1(q) = c1q2 + c2 and ξ

length (mesh size) is slightly lower in dense ionic

domains and slightly higher in swollen neutral domains.

The red curve in Fig. 9 demonstrates that the resulting ξtot obtained from the OZ fit of Stot(q) is almost independent of λ. In the range of −1 < λ < λ*, this may be attributed to the

compensation of the two simultaneous but opposite effects.

The increasing coacervate density shown in Fig. 5 should lead

to the decrease in its average mesh size, while the increasing

fluctuations in ϕtot(r) seen in Fig. 6 result in the growth of ξ. At λ > λ*, when the average density decreases and density

fluctuations continue growing, ξtot slightly increases. We

emphasize that both the changes in the coacervate density and

ξtot are moderate in the entire range of blockiness. In this respect, a comparison between the almost unchanged ξtot and the compositional correlation length ξm that strongly increases with λ is insightful, and it is performed in what follows.

The structure factor Sm(q) shown in Fig. 8c characterizes

compositional

fluctuations

and

compositional

inhomogeneities within the coacervate. As compared to

Stot(q), Sm(q) grows much stronger in the range of low q at increasing λ, thereby confirming that the segregation between

ionic and neutral monomers is the driving force for the MST

while moderate undulations of the total polymer density

ϕtot(r) is the secondary effect caused by the preferential

partitioning of the solvent to the neutral domains. The

compositional difference between neutral and ionic domains

is much higher than their density difference.

For (co)PEs with λ = −1, the Sm(q) behavior in the high-q range is special. The peapkﬃﬃﬃ due to monomer connectivity is shifted to approximately 2 lower values in comparison with

that for more blocky counterparts because the even (ionic or

neutral) monomers in alternating chains are separated from

each opthﬃﬃeﬃ r by two, rather than one covalent bond, and the factor 2 (rather than 2) is due to the chain flexibility. Since

alternating sequences entirely prohibit the segregation

between ionic and neutral monomers at large lengths, r ≫

2σ, Sm(q) tends to zero at low q more rapidly for λ = −1.

Fig. 8c shows that the low-q values of Sm(q) increase at increasing λ, in accordance with the coacervate snapshots

shown in Fig. 6 and demonstrating the increasing

heterogeneity above the threshold value λ* that can be

tentatively identified with the MST. One can speculate that,

at λ = 0.9, Sm(q) exhibits a peak, albeit low and wide. The

broad shape of the peak and the absence of higher-order

reflections (other peaks) imply a lack of long-range order in

the domain spacing within the inhomogeneous coacervate

(cf. microphase separated, lamellar coacervates for regular

copolymers with Sm(q) that demonstrate high and narrow main and satellite peaks, Fig. S5 in ESI†). Thus, on the

basis of the Sm(q) shape, one can suggest that the
coacervate has a microphase-separated disordered, microemulsion structure.78–82 Unfortunately, our simulation

data for λ > λ* are noisy is the range of low q due to the

limited size of the simulation box, and we are unable to see

the peaks for other curves, λ = 0.8 and λ = 0.85, although

they are expected for microemulsions.

Paper

These results are also consistent with those observed in simulations29,30 of microemulsion-like structures for melts of random AB copolymers. Using the Ginzburg criterion, it has been shown that the fluctuation-dominated region near the MST in these systems is wide29,30 and, in contrast to the case of regular copolymers, does not diminish at increasing chain length N. In this respect, random copolymers again resemble more low-molecular weight liquids rather than diblock copolymers, see eqn (27). We emphasize that the lack of the domain long-range order in coacervates is due to random, non-regular statistics of n and i monomers in PEs. For regular multiblock PEs composed of alternating charged and neutral blocks of (sufficiently high) average length comparable with Λ, both our simulations (Fig. S4 and S5 in ESI†) and SCFT calculations by Sing indicate the lamellar ordering of the domains.38 This resembles the formation of super-crystalline lattices in melts of regular multiblock copolymers,83 with AB diblock copolymer melts being the simplest example, and the lack of the translational order in melts of statistical copolymers,30 at least for equal incompatibilities χAB and the average block lengths.72
An important difference between the coacervates considered here and AB random copolymer melts, however, is that coacervates contain some solvent that redistributes between the domains through the course of microphase separation. The solvent is preferentially absorbed by the domains rich in neutral monomers and can be considered as selective.84–86 We believe that the strong swelling of the neutral domains due to the good solvent quality for polymer chains is the main reason for the decreasing coacervate density at high λ.
To quantitatively confirm the increase in the domain size of the inhomogeneous coacervate at increasing λ, Sm(q) structure factors were also fitted with the OZ function. Another option could have been to fit them with the microemulsion structure factor, S(q)−m1 ≈ c0q4 + c1q2 + c2 (see Fig. S8 and Table S1 in ESI†),79 but we neither observe the compositional structure factor decaying according to Porod's law Sm(q) ∝ q−4 at high q (see Fig. S9 in ESI†) nor do we have accurate data in the vicinity of the peak and for low q values (see Fig. 8c). The latter should be attributed to the finite size of the box and limited time scales accessible in our simulations.
However, even the ξm obtained via a simple OZ fit, shown in Fig. 9 (blue line), is a monotonically increasing function that rapidly grows in the vicinity of λ*. For λ = −1, Sm(q) does not follow the OZ expression because of the reasons discussed above (see also Fig. S7 in ESI†), and the corresponding ξm value is not included. At λ > λ* the characteristic domain size ξm describing the segregation between neutral and ionic monomers is much larger than the coacervate mesh size ξtot. These results support the idea that the coacervate phase evolves from a homogeneous to inhomogeneous microemulsion state as the charge blockiness λ increases.
Although the considerations presented here were devoted to the case of good solvent, the formation of inhomogeneous coacervates under Θ and poor solvent conditions is also

anticipated. The decreasing solvent quality and resulting increasing density of the homogeneous coacervates is expected to lead to a lower threshold blockiness λ* provoking the MST. However, the density inhomogeneities within the coacervate should be lower because the domains rich in neutral monomers will swell less as than in a good solvent.
V Conclusions
By integrating computer simulations and a theoretical framework based on the random phase approximation (RPA), it has been possible to rationalize the effects of monomer sequence on the phase behavior of complex coacervates formed from random (co)polyelectrolytes. The monomer sequence of these chains is controlled by a first-order Markov process, and can be experimentally achieved by means of statistical copolymerization. Using molecular dynamics and Gibbs ensemble simulations, we have confirmed our theoretical predictions for the role of charge blockiness in polyelectrolyte complex coacervation. High charge clustering is shown to facilitate coacervation, i.e., to extend the twophase region of the phase diagram and to improve coacervate salt resistance. The radial distribution functions of oppositely charged monomers within the coacervate are obtained in simulations to demonstrate at the microscopic level that the increasing coacervate density at increasing λ should be attributed to the stronger charge correlations.
While the theoretical framework is (rigorously) applicable to polyelectrolytes carrying small fraction of charged groups only, f ≪ 1, simulations demonstrate that the principal theoretical findings also hold for the highly charged systems with f ∼ 1 that are often studied in experiments. The role of the charge blockiness is shown to be similar for good and poor solvent conditions. The main difference between these cases is that, in a good solvent, coacervate binodals have a “closed” shape, while binodals in poor solvent conditions are “open”. These results are consistent with earlier experimental findings.
We also considered the complex coacervation of PEs with equal linear charge densities, f+ = f−, but unequal charge clustering, λ+ ≠ λ−. For a fixed sum of the correlation parameters, λ+ + λ− = const, the increasing sequence asymmetry, i.e., the increasing difference between λ− and λ+, leads to a higher propensity for coacervation. Theory and simulations have been further generalized to charge-densityasymmetric coacervates, f+ ≠ f−, in order to demonstrate that varying λ for only one of the polyelectrolytes is sufficient to tune the coacervation envelope. This result suggests that the most straightforward experimental way to test our predictions would be to consider coacervation in fully charged homopolycations (f+ = 1) and partially charged (co)polyanions (e.g., f− = 1/2), with the charge blockiness λ− controlled through the conditions of the respective statistical copolymerization.
Computer simulations were also aimed at characterizing the complex coacervation of highly blocky (co)polyelectrolytes with λ close to unity. The theoretical framework proposed here, which predicts a monotonous growth of the coacervate

density at increasing λ, can not be applied in this range of parameters because it assumes a homogeneous internal structure of the coacervate. Indeed, simulations reveal that, above a threshold value λ*, the density of the polymer-rich phase goes down with increasing blockiness. This is due to the formation of inhomogeneous, microphase-separated coacervates that consist of dense domains rich in ionic monomers and more swollen domains rich in neutral monomers. Analysis of the structure factors demonstrates the absence of long-range order within the locally segregated coacervate. Its disordered microemulsion-like structure resembles that of a melt of neutral random AB copolymers.
The results presented here provide a comprehensive computational and theoretical framework to guide molecular design efforts and experiments aimed at tuning the structure and properties of coacervate-based materials through control of monomer sequences. A prospective way to test the effects of charge blockiness in statistical (co)polyelectrolytes and their complex coacervation has been proposed, along with suggestions to address the expected challenges associated with maintaining the precise lengths N and the average charge density f for a series of polyions with different sequence statistics λ. Given the vast experimental state space of multicomponent statistical (co)polyelectrolytes, the proposed theory- and simulation-driven predictive capabilities should be of use.
