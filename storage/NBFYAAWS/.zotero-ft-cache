A brief guideline for studies of phase-separated biomolecular condensates

Cells are exquisitely compartmentalized to achieve precise spatiotemporal regulation of myriad processes and pathways. Phase separation offers one way to achieve territorial organization in the cellular context, via the creation of membrane-less organelles (MLOs). MLOs formed through phase separation are associated with numerous critical biological functions. Although hundreds of publications on related topics are produced each year, robust criteria for the determination of biologically meaningful phase separation are yet to be well established. Here we present some principles and propose a few guidelines for phase-separation studies in biology. Specifically, we provide an in-depth experiment pipeline for phase-separation studies, including mechanisms of the molecular driving forces, ways to correlate in vivo and in vitro observations, and strategies to relate the phase-separation phenomenon to biological functions. We also intend to contribute to streamlining the aforementioned diagnostic criteria by further stressing a few common caveats in the field.
Eukaryotic cells are extensively compartmentalized for the efficient organization of materials, biochemical reactions and information flow via various membrane-enclosed organelles as well as numerous membrane-less organelles (MLOs)1. The latter, also referred to as biomolecular condensates, fulfill various cellular functions. It has recently been revealed that biomolecular condensates are formed in part through a process called phase separation, predominantly liquidliquid phase separation (LLPS), in cells1,2. Phase-separated condensates sometimes transition to solid-like forms (liquid–solid phase separation) in physiological or pathological scenarios3,4. Phase separation is a well-understood physiochemical phenomenon in disciplines such as polymer chemistry and soft-matter physics, and indicates the generation of multiple distinct phases out of homogeneous solutions. It is now clear to biologists that phase separation leads to the concentration of specific biological macromolecules and is a major driving force for the formation of cellular MLOs. With a growing appreciation of the importance of phase separation in biology, there are many situations in which researchers may want to experimentally study the phase-separation properties of a system.
A clear grasp of phase-separation properties will help biologists to better understand the functions and mechanisms of action of MLOs. Sophisticated and systematic experimental evidence, combining both in vivo and in vitro results, is required. When accumulating the necessary evidence, many principles should be noted and several caveats should be taken into account. In this Perspective we briefly introduce aspects that investigators should consider in the design of objective and comprehensive experiments. A general scheme is shown in Fig. 1. Specifically, we have established a proper experimental design to validate a phase-separation phenomenon or characterize a phase-separating biomacromolecular system, and we have explained the molecular features of constituents within condensates. Moreover, we have emphasized that studies of MLOs have to be closely related to their biological functions. We also point out some caveats that are often encountered and provide strategies to avoid them in future studies. Note that we focus mainly on protein phase separation, as proteins are the major components of biomolecular condensates. Other biological macromolecules, such as DNA, RNA or even lipids and glycogen5, are extensively involved in this process but are beyond the scope of this Perspective.

determined by the threshold concentration for phase separation and their absolute concentration within condensates. For clients, inclusion is mainly determined by the effective affinities of direct or indirect interactions with the scaffolds. As an example, Rab3 interacting molecule (RIM) and RIM-binding proteins (BPs) are essential for mediating the formation of condensates at presynaptic active zones via LLPS. Simultaneous knockout of RIM and RIM-BP abolishes the dense structure in the active zone8. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which are unable to phase-separate on their own, can be enriched in condensates by direct interaction with RIM and RIM-BP9. Owing to
Distinguish scaffolds and clients
Biomolecular condensates typically contain hundreds or more molecular components, but only a small number of them are essential for structural integrity6. These molecules are called scaffolds, form condensates through multivalent interactions, and are indispensable for driving phase separation. Other components favorably partition into condensates via direct or indirect association with scaffolds. These components are referred to as clients7. Both scaffolds and clients are enriched within condensates versus the surroundings. For scaffolds, the degree of enrichment is largely

A general guideline for studies of phase-separated biomolecular condensates
Fig. 1 | A general guideline for studies of phase-separated molecular condensates. There are two major scenarios for the initiation of a phase-separation-related project. The first is hypothesis-driven: researchers perceive it as biologically meaningful if their proteins of interest (POIs) form condensates in cells. The second is observation-based: an MLO is observed, often during the imaging of fluorescently tagged proteins in cells. After studying the functions of an MLO and testing its dynamic properties, we identify the major components of the MLO and tentatively distinguish scaffolds from clients. From this effort we obtain a list of potential scaffolds as our POIs. Subsequently, both scenarios converge on a common step—to identify the multivalency of the POIs. For POIs without LCDs, the multivalency may come from interactions between the structural domains of several POIs. For POIs with LCDs, their multivalency may come from interactions at the amino-acid level, which can
be largely clarified by sequence analysis. Next, we can purify POIs to perform various phase-separation experiments in vitro. Phase diagram analysis is of great value, and the dynamic properties of phase-separated condensates should be measured using fusion assays and FRAP. Some associated biochemical experiments are required, such as perturbation of the phase-separation process using reagents and mutant proteins, assessing client recruitment and monitoring other biochemical activities. In parallel, we should observe the endogenous morphology and localization of MLOs in cells. Manipulation of condensates by light or genetics can help to determine whether phase separation is critical for a specific biological function. Rescue by grafting, that is, replacing the phase-separating domains with ones that are evolutionarily distant but with similar phase-separation capacity, is highly encouraged.

their distinct architectural roles and hence modes of regulation, it is important to determine whether a component within a condensate is a scaffold or a client. It is worth noting that although clients may be dispensable for the structural integrity of biomolecular condensates, some clients may function in regulating the condensates. The client valency determines client recruitment into condensates, and thus the droplet properties10. Accordingly, the function and contribution of clients cannot be ignored.
Understand the molecular mechanisms of phase separation
While studying functional MLOs, a vital step is to understand the molecular driving forces underlying phase separation. In this section we demonstrate a few major driving forces for scaffolds to phase-separate spontaneously (Fig. 2).
Multivalent tandem structured domains drive phase separation. It has long been appreciated that proteins are modular, meaning that evolutionarily conserved regions of proteins often autonomously fold into discrete domains, and large proteins are often composed of multiple domains. Perplexingly, some proteins are composed of multiple copies of the same type of domain. The topology of repeating domains within one molecule or one complex is referred to as multivalency. Often, multivalent domains are involved in protein–ligand interactions, where the ligands can be protein domains, peptide motifs, RNA motifs, DNA motifs, sugar residues within polysaccharides or lipid moieties. The ligands themselves are frequently multivalent11. For example, multivalent RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) can each bind multiple short and degenerate RNA motifs within a reasonably long RNA oligo. Multivalent interactions between binding partners may increase the overall mutual affinity via additivity. It has been established that the additivity of multivalent interactions can achieve an apparent affinity stronger than that of avidin and biotin12. However, nature must have designed such multivalent interactions to conduct more specific missions. Indeed, multivalent interactions have been shown to lead to phase separation and the formation of biomolecular condensates in test tubes and in cells13. Theories of multivalency-driven phase separation are well
established in the field of polymer chemistry14–16. Mechanistically, the multivalency of an individual molecule allows its simultaneous dynamic engagement with multiple binding partners. Multivalency of the latter further enables the formation of dynamic interacting networks, a process sometimes coupled with phase separation (Fig. 2). Interestingly, modular multivalent proteins often only undergo phase separation in the presence of their multivalent binding partners. Examples include N-WASP/Nck13, PTBP1/RNA oligos17, PSD95/SynGAP18, p62/polyUb19 and SPOP/Daxx20.
Low-complexity domains are another major driving force for phase separation. Another major driving force for biological phase separation arises from certain less solidly structured regions of proteins. These proteins or domains are termed ‘intrinsically disordered regions’ based on their lack of known structure or ‘low-complexity domains’ (LCDs) based on their biased amino-acid distribution, often containing repeated segments. The two groups overlap substantially21. Such sequences are quite prevalent, but have long been underrepresented among structured proteins in the Protein Data Bank22, so investigations into their functions and molecular mechanisms used to be quite limited. In recent years, many of these proteins were found to have a strong tendency to undergo self-assembly, both in vitro and in vivo23,24, and are thus considered a major contributor to LLPS or liquid–solid phase separation. The phase separation of proteins with LCDs is related to essential biological functions such as transcription regulation25, cell division26 and differentiation27. The mechanism by which LCDs trigger phase separation is controversial. Because of their special sequence identity, it was proposed that the overall amino-acid composition directs interactions and is important in driving the assembly process. For example, positively charged residues and aromatic/hydrophobic residues are prevalent and typically cluster within LCDs. They form cation–π interactions, the electrostatic interaction between a cation and a polarizable π-electron cloud. However, another point of view suggests that there is a defined structural basis underlying LCD-driven phase separation (Fig. 2). A few pieces of evidence have been presented to support this theory. (1) Computational assessments have indicated that a statistically significant proportion of LCDs have a high propensity to form secondary structures22,28. (2) Single amino-acid substitutions along the sequence have different effects on the phase-separation capability, so there could be structured core and peripheral disordered regions that perform distinct roles in driving phase separation3,29. (3) The structure of LCDs, although impractical to resolve in their in-cell state, can be solved in their in vitro configuration. These LCD sequences can form cross-β structures in vitro while adopting an amyloid fibril state. Mutations that disrupt the cross-β structures can also inhibit phase separation30,31. (4) Besides side-chain interactions, the main-chain hydrogen bonding also contributes to labile cross-β interactions, promoting self-assembly and phase separation of LCDs32. (5) Footprinting results show that the in vitro-solved structure has great overlap and close correlation with the in vivo state, thereby supporting the structure-driven phase separation theory29,33. Further investigations are needed to determine which of the above theories is closest to reality. New techniques in structural biology, with higher resolution and superior capability to capture transient or dynamic states, will help us get to the real state more confidently. Also, with the assistance of cellular imaging techniques, such as cryo-electron tomography, the state of cellular proteins will be described more precisely.
Interplay between tandem structured domains and LCDs. Although multivalent structured domains and LCDs can each independently drive phase separation, in many cases the two contribute together. For example, numerous transcription and splicing factors, including most heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, harbor tandem

Fig. 2 | A schematic diagram showing the constituents of phase-separated condensates. Phase separation is driven by multivalent interactions. The multivalency can originate from tandem repeats or oligomerization of structural domains; from charge–charge, dipole–dipole, cation–π or cross-β interactions of low-complexity sequences; or from the cooperation of structural domains and low-complexity sequences.

RRMs, along with LCDs34. The interplay between the tandem folded domain and the low-complexity region can modify the dependence of phase behavior35. There is also a strong connection between the two in the cellular context. It has been demonstrated that scaffolding proteins form a specific and robust meshwork through multivalent interactions, supporting the structure of the postsynaptic density and the presynaptic active zone9,36. Meanwhile, abundant proteins with LCDs are also reported to phase-separate locally in synapses. Synapsin 1, a synaptic vesicle protein, undergoes phase separation via its C-terminal proline-rich LCD37. In addition, synapsin 1 interacts with structured SH3-domain-containing scaffolding proteins and generates valence-dependent droplets. This indicates that tandem structured domains and low-complexity regions can cooperatively regulate the clustering of synaptic vesicles at the presynapse. Mechanistically, the homotypic or heterotypic interactions of LCDs are also multivalent in nature, similar to the tandemly repeated structured domains. So, both forces can be intermingled to form the final condensates (Fig. 2).
Predict phase-separation potential
Scientists have developed sophisticated computational tools to predict the phase-separation potentials of specific proteins21. For example, SEG partitions globular and non-globular regions and helps to identify low-complexity regions within target proteins38. LARKS (low-complexity aromatic-rich kinked segments) focuses on the potential of a sequence to form an amyloid-like structure39. PhaSePred built machine learning models by integrating multimodal features to screen self-assembling and partner-dependent phase-separation proteins separately40. Investigators can also refer to databases that curate protein entries with the potential to undergo phase separation41,42. As stated above, there are two major types of scaffold: proteins containing LCDs and proteins harboring multivalent tandem structured domains. However, most sequence-based prediction tools tend to recognize LCD-specific features. These algorithms largely ignore phase separation of proteins with low LCD content, especially proteins with multivalent folded domains. Although these tools and resources can help researchers determine whether their systems of interest potentially undergo phase separation, it is advisable to look into phase separation after experimental observation of MLOs and/ or scientific reasoning, invoking a phase-separation mechanism that enables advanced understanding of a biological phenomenon.
Carry out detailed phase-diagram analysis
A phase diagram is used to describe the physical state of a protein or other molecules under a series of different conditions. The boundary between the states represents a critical condition, such as component concentrations, when two aqueous phases start to separate in a switch-like manner. The critical concentration for a phase-separating system varies with environmental properties such as temperature, ion concentration, pH and pressure. Crowding reagents are used to mimic cellular environments with macromolecular crowding, but there are potential pitfalls that should be noted (Box 1). Furthermore, although most phase diagrams depict the phase-separating behavior of isolated molecules in vitro, it is very valuable to construct phase diagrams in vivo by observing the condensates in the presence of a range of environmental conditions (temperature, salt concentrations, pressure, pH and so on)43. The nature of a specific molecule should be considered as well as its cellular behavior, to obtain a full-scale characterization from the phase diagram.
Dissect the valency dependence of phase separation
As we explained above, multivalency underlies phase separation. Therefore, the dependence of phase separation on valency should be well demonstrated. Decreasing or increasing the number of repeated elements should substantially impact the phase diagram (Fig. 1). Identifying mutants that disrupt multivalency and quantifying how (much)
each mutant interferes with the condensation process can reveal basic information about how and why the protein domains are organized in the way they are. There is a misunderstanding in the field that the presence of LCDs is an essential condition for phase separation. In fact, more than 4,000 human proteins contain LCDs longer than 30 amino acids44. Among them, only a fraction actually possess phase-separation potential. Sequences with specific amino-acid compositions are more likely to undergo phase separation than others. As an example, in heat-stressed cells, the phase-separation property of Pub1 is determined by its folded RRM domains, and its LCD acts as a modifier45. Therefore, while carrying out phase-separation studies, it is critical to notice that LCDs are not essential for phase separation.
Correlate cellular observations with in vitro reconstitution
A phase-separation-related project might start from observation of a cellular condensate, or identification of a protein with a high potential to undergo phase separation. However, to eventually arrive at the conclusion that phase separation plays a role in related biological functions, both cellular observations and in vitro reconstitution experiments should be performed (Fig. 1). The capture of cellular condensates might suggest that the target molecule is related to phase separation in some way, but in vitro reconstitution experiments reveal more about the mechanism of how the condensate is formed. On the other hand, in vitro results alone are insufficient, as they lack actual biological or physiological relevance. Phase separation is a highly concentration and condition-dependent process. Many in vitro experiments are carried out at concentrations way beyond physiological ones. Therefore, the actual physiological states should be considered when evaluating a biologically relevant phase separation. Moreover, prediction software is mainly sequence-based and does not take physiological concentrations into consideration. Actual experiments must be done to verify the physiological relevance. For in vivo experiments, numerous cellular imaging experiments are performed in an overexpression setting. Therefore, immunostaining of the protein itself or imaging of an endogenously tagged protein helps nail down phase-separation phenomena at the physiological level. Also, the expression levels of endogenous proteins are dynamically controlled and constantly changing. Consequently, it is important to combine in vitro experiments with in vivo observations to arrive at concrete conclusions.
Box 1
Potential artifacts due to crowding reagents
Crowding reagents such as poly(ethylene glycol), dextran and Ficoll are sometimes used to demonstrate that a system is capable of undergoing LLPS in vitro. There have been extensive investigations into the physiochemical principles of the effects of crowding reagents on phase separation of macromolecules94. The underlying rationale for using these reagents is to mimic the crowded environment in cells. Although crowding reagents are highly effective in promoting LLPS in general, the legitimacy of the in vivo mimicking effect is less certain, as crowding reagents-induced LLPS says little about their biological significance. The field of biomolecular condensates pursues physiologically relevant phase separation. Accordingly, we should be cautious of rushing the interpretation of phase-separation phenomena that can only happen in the presence of crowding reagents.

Moreover, although some technologies can be used to study condensates both in vitro and in cells, the same measurements of the same components are sometimes inconsistent in these two settings. For example, the recovery rate may differ in fluorescence recovery after bleaching (FRAP) experiments on the same components in vivo and in vitro. The compositions of intracellular condensates are much more complex, making the biophysical properties distinct from those in in vitro-reconstituted droplets. Some cellular condensates are anisotropic in structure. Stress granules (SGs), for example, have a rigid core structure surrounded by a liquid-like shell, but the in vitro-reconstituted droplets do not have such subcompartmentalized structures46. Also, the in vitro environment in a test tube is quite static, whereas intracellular molecules are constantly moving or trafficking. The dynamic intracellular environment, with its constant flux of molecules, undoubtedly modulates the local environment and the properties of condensates therein.
Be cautious in interpreting imaging results
Optical imaging is often used for characterizing a phase-separating system, but caution should be exercised to avoid false positives. Puncta observed in an immunostaining experiment do not directly equate to phase-separated condensates. First, not all antibodies are of high enough quality and specificity to produce trustworthy immunofluorescence results. Also, many punctum-like objects observed in cells—such as autophagosomes and lysosomes—are not membrane-less. If a novel condensate is observed, we suggest first determining its relationship with known cellular organelles, such as nuclear paraspeckles, cytoplasmic P-bodies, autophagosomes, lysosomes and so on. If possible, electron microscopy should be employed to investigate whether the condensate is membrane-bound or not. Moreover, diffraction-limited fluorescence imaging can obscure the true underlying structure47. Note that the critical concentration is not equal to the concentration at which droplets are detectable. Phase separation occurs far below the point when droplets are visible48. However, due to the resolution limit of confocal microscopy, the smallest droplets that can be observed are hundreds of nanometers or larger in diameter. The diffraction of fluorescent probes themselves often leads to the inaccurate definition of condensates, especially when they are small in size. The changes to protein properties by the fusion of fluorescent tags should also be considered (Box 2). Combinatorial strategies are encouraged to facilitate imaging results. A turbidity assay at 600 nm can be used to monitor the kinetics of phase separation. A sedimentation assay can be used to pellet the droplets and quantitatively examine phase-separating proteins, along with the accompanying components49.
Analyze molecular diffusion and exchange
In 2009, P-granules in Caenorhabditis elegans were reported to have liquid-like properties2. Many studies have subsequently demonstrated that LLPS occurs in many pathways through the formation of MLOs in vivo. Molecules diffuse in and out of MLOs and exchange with the surrounding environment. Nevertheless, MLOs could be more than liquid-like. MLOs possess a continuum of dynamicity, ranging from liquid to solid, or even amyloid-like. Less dynamic biomolecular condensates have been described, such as centrosomes, nuclear pores and functional amyloid-like bodies50. The pericentriolar material (PCM) is a gel-like scaffold in the proximity of the centriole. The in vitro-reconstituted SPD-5 condensate that mimics the mitotic PCM is stable in solution and does not fuse or recover upon photobleaching51. Velo1, the protein that maintains the structure of Balbiani bodies, has amyloid-like properties and forms a stable matrix. Its amyloid-like self-assembly can cluster mitochondria in vitro52. However, the properties of these stable condensates can alter, and the condensates may either disassemble or enter liquid-like states. Likewise, liquid-to-solid phase transition of proteins is not uncommon and could play key roles in several different biological processes4,53.
Multiple techniques are available to detect the dynamics of condensates. The fusion of droplets is a strong indication of liquidity. The fusion procedure should be monitored whenever possible, and the fusion speed should be quantified. FRAP and fluorescence loss in photobleaching are non-invasive techniques that are frequently used to explore the dynamic properties of condensates, both in vivo and in vitro54. Atomic force microscopy can be used to measure the elasticities of condensates55. The motions of genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles are used to measure the viscosity of condensates56. More new techniques that evaluate material properties need to be applied in phase-separation studies.
Analyze the size and morphology of MLOs
Cellular phase-separated MLOs have a number of characteristic biophysical properties. A detailed description of these properties is encouraged. Among them, the size and morphology of condensates, though diverse, are important factors that help to identify and characterize phase-separated systems. The diameters of MLOs in cells generally range from a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers. The size of the condensates determines the specific surface area, which further affects the molecular exchange rate and other dynamic properties of the MLOs. Surface tension largely determines size and morphology, and thus acts as a critical regulatory factor of liquid-like condensates. For example, the recruitment of MEG-3 and RNAs changes the surface tension and controls the size distribution of guanyl-specific endoribonuclease granules (PGL granules). In this regard, MEG-3 and RNAs act as interfacial stabilizers of LLPS due to a Pickering effect53,57. Perfect liquid droplets are expected to be spherical. However, within the complex cellular environment, condensates can be shaped by surrounding structures and regulatory molecules. For example, the addition of target mRNA changes the morphology of TIS11B condensates from spherical to mesh-like58. Moreover, the shape of condensates can undergo time-dependent changes. For example, over time, spherical droplets formed by several RNA-binding proteins go
Box 2
Fluorescent tags might alter protein phase-separation properties
Fluorescent tags are stable, sensitive and powerful tools in phase-separation studies, both in vitro and in vivo. As well as green fluorescent protein and mCherry, other smaller genetically encoded fusion protein tags can be used, such as the tetracysteine tag that couples with the FlAsH/ReAsH fluorophores. Their advantages or disadvantages have been extensively discussed95. It should be remembered that when fluorescent tags are fused to target proteins or RNAs, there is a risk that the tags might influence the overall molecular properties (such as solubility, structural folding and proteolytic degradation) and the cellular location of the tagged molecule. In phase-separation studies, in particular, protein solubility influences the critical concentration, so using a tag that changes the solubility eventually alters the phase-separation property. In some cases, the fusion proteins might misfold and mislocalize in cells. Therefore, when using a tag, it is imperative to carefully consider the influence of the tag on the properties of the target protein.

through morphological changes into fiber-like structures17,59. Research is ongoing to uncover more factors that regulate the size and morphology of MLOs.
Study the spatiotemporal distribution of condensates
MLOs must have precise geographical locations to carry out their biological functions (Fig. 3). The spatiotemporal distributions of MLOs are affected by the location of their components, directed by their interacting molecules, and limited by their tethered cell structures. MLOs form when the scaffold proteins are above critical concentrations, and the locations of these MLOs are largely decided by interacting proteins. We can take the protein SMN (survival of motor neuron) as an example. The binding of its Tudor domain to ligands carrying dimethylarginine is sufficient for condensate formation. The location of dimethylarginine determines whether the two nuclear MLOs—gems and Cajal bodies—are separated or attached to one another60. Similarly, the formation of cytoplasm-located PGL granules is driven by the interaction of PGL, LAF-1 and RNA, whereas their asymmetrical distribution is regulated by the local concentration of MEG-357. Furthermore, the crosstalk between MLOs and cellular-membrane systems is of profound importance for determining the location of MLOs. Certain condensates
emerge proximal to other organelles or on membranes. For example, phosphorylated nephrin, a transmembrane protein located on cell membranes, induces phase separation at the cell periphery to form domains that move through actomyosin contraction61. Moreover, MLOs might travel along the cytoskeleton or tether to other organelles. In highly polarized cells such as neurons, membrane-less RNP granules tether to lysosomes during long-distance transport. In this cellular process, annexin A11 (ANXA11) acts as a molecular adaptor between SGs and lysosomes62. Notably, MLOs are highly dynamic and might change their temporal distribution to accompany different biological events. For example, during mitosis, the dual-specificity kinase DYRK3 acts as a central dissolvase to disassemble several MLOs61. These MLOs reappear as mitosis is completed. Such chronological assembly/disassembly of MLOs could be monitored to dissect the roles of MLOs in the timing of related biological activities. In summary, the spatiotemporal features of MLOs are tightly connected with their functions. When evaluating whether a protein might phase-separate in vivo, it is critical to compare the location of the observed puncta to when and where the cellular biological function is actually performed.
Identify the components of MLOs
Phase-separated cellular condensates are dynamic and lack phospholipid membranes, making them hard to isolate with classic biochemical strategies. However, to gain comprehensive insights into how these condensates are formed and achieve their biological functions, analyzing their compositions is obligatory. Methods to isolate phase-separated condensates include centrifugation, proximal labeling63, sorting64 and so on. Large-scale genetic screens are also helpful for understanding key regulators, which are usually also components of granules65. Furthermore, in vitro reconstitution of phase-separated granules is helpful for understanding their compositional specificity. Commonly used approaches include liquid-droplet pelleting66 and hydrogel trapping3. As yet, none of the currently available strategies perfectly reflect dynamic compositional changes, so new techniques are needed.
Study biological functions of phase-separated MLOs
MLOs mediate many cellular pathways and function in numerous physiological and pathological circumstances, which have already been extensively reviewed67. As the studies of MLOs have to reflect their biological functions, here we provide a distinct categorization of them, based on the different functions they perform.
Constitutive condensates perform housekeeping functions. Some MLOs largely exist throughout the entire lifetime of cells. For example, cytoplasmic P-bodies are responsible for translational repression and mRNA degradation68, and the nucleolus facilitates ribosome biogenesis and protein quality control. The nucleolus, the most prominent dense structure observed in the eukaryotic nucleus, is a multiphase condensate with a fibrillarin ‘core’ surrounded by a nucleophosmin-rich liquid ‘shell’. These components provide substrate specificity (for example, the RNA-binding domains of fibrillarin) and recruit their partners to form the two mutually incompatible liquid phases69. The constitutive MLOs typically play very basic housekeeping roles.
MLOs respond to intracellular or external signals. Many MLOs are dynamic phase-separated condensates that only form at the right time and at the right location under the control of cellular signals. In these processes, localized signals trigger the recruitment of scaffolds so that their local concentrations are elevated beyond the critical concentrations required for phase separation. Many cellular physiological responses depend on signal-induced regulation of a phase-separation system. One well-characterized signal-controlled phase-separation system is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,

Fig. 4 | Signal-controlled dynamic condensates. a, Phase separationdependent signaling in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Left: in the absence of Wnt ligands, the degradosome is formed through LLPS driven by multivalent interactions between the scaffold proteins axin and APC (adenomatous polyposis coli protein). The degradosome enhances the phosphorylation of β-catenin and triggers its proteasomal degradation. Right: when Wnt binds the transmembrane Frizzled receptor and the LRP5/6 coreceptor, Dishevelled and axin together condense into the signalosome at the plasma membrane. Unphosphorylated β-catenin is then released and translocates into the nucleus, where it induces target gene expression. TFs, transcription factors. b, LLPS in p62-dependent autophagic degradation. Misfolded proteins are ubiquitinated and recognized by the polymerized form of p62 to generate a p62 body. The p62 body concentrates the cargo–receptor complex for autophagic uptake. c, Phase separation at the synapse. At the presynaptic bouton, phase
separation of synapsin maintains the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs). Similarly, the postsynaptic density (PSD) is organized mainly by LLPS of PSD95, SynGAP and other scaffold proteins. The function of the PSD is to concentrate neurotransmitter receptors and downstream signaling molecules. In addition, the synaptic cleft also assembles distinct nanodomains. AZ, active zone; PSD, postsynaptic density; SV, synaptic vesicle. d, Regulation of phase separation by cysteine oxidation. In the tomato shoot apical meristem (SAM, boxed region), TMF is specifically expressed at the boundary where H2O2 is locally enriched. The cysteine residues of the TMF transcription factor can form intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds to concatenate TMF molecules and drive LLPS upon developmental redox signaling. This oxidation-mediated TMF condensate binds and sequesters the promoter of the ANANTHA gene (AN in the figure), repressing its expression and delaying flower differentiation.

in which Wnt triggers the LLPS of Dishevelled into the signalosome to induce translocation of β-catenin and the expression of downstream genes70,71 (Fig. 4a). Other examples include the assembly of p62 bodies in autophagy activation19 (Fig. 4b) and downstream signaling of the T-cell and B-cell receptors in immunology72, as well as the formation of pre- and postsynaptic condensates in neuronal synaptic sites9,18 (Fig. 4c). Environmental cues can also change the phase-separation status. One way is by altering the post-translational modification state of condensate component proteins. For example, upon developmental H2O2 oxidation, the cysteine residues of the terminating flower (TMF) transcription factor can form disulfide bonds to increase multivalent interactions between LCDs and between TMF and its target promoters. The oxidation-mediated TMF condensate represses ANANTHA expression for precise regulation of flowering time73 (Fig. 4d).
Cells adapt to stress conditions through phase separation. Certain cellular condensates act as an adaptative mechanism for responding to increased duration under unfavorable conditions. The SGs quickly form and dissociate in response to cellular stresses such as altered temperature, cellular redox, pH and osmotic status. For example, polyadenylate binding protein (Pab1), a key component of SGs, is a temperature-sensitive protein whose thermally responsive self-assembly rate is 160-fold higher than typical biological processes, making it a thermal sensor74,75 (Fig. 5a). Similarly, upon cold shock, cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) is upregulated, methylated and then translocated to the cytoplasmic SGs76 (Fig. 5b). H2O2 and arsenite induce hyperoxidation. The methionine-rich LCDs of yeast Pbp1 and TDP43 could be oxidized to inhibit self-association33,77. Melting the Pbp1 LLPS droplets activates TORC1 and mediates autophagy, clearing the oxidatively damaged cellular components78,79 (Fig. 5c).

Fig. 5 | Schematic diagrams of condensates regulated in response to
environmental stresses. a,b, Temperature stress-regulated phase separation. In a, heat-stress-triggered phase separation of Pab1. Under physiological thermal conditions, Pab1 binds to mRNA. Upon heat stress, Pab1 proteins undergo phase separation, and the bound mRNAs are released. In b, CIRBP localizes in the nucleus. In response to cold stress, it translocates to the cytoplasm and acts as an RNA chaperone to stabilize and protect mRNAs. c, Oxidative stress regulates Pbp1 phase separation. The C-terminal methionine-rich LCD of Pbp1 undergoes phase separation. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidize methionine to methionine sulfoxide and impair the phase separation of Pbp1. TORC1 proteins sequestrated in Pbp1 condensates are then released, which triggers TORC1mediated autophagy to clear the oxidatively damaged cellular components.
d, Formation of the hypoxia-induced glycolytic body. During hypoxic stress, glycolysis enzymes are concentrated into glycolytic bodies to enhance the rate of glucose consumption. e, pH-triggered phase transition in the cytoplasm. In budding yeast, when cells are deprived of energy during dormancy, the lower intracellular pH results in widespread packing of proteins into macromolecular assemblies. The cytoplasm transits from a fluid state to a protective solid state. f, Osmotic stress-induced condensation of YAP. YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that normally binds to enhancers of target genes in the nucleus. Upon hyperosmotic shock, YAP forms condensates at super-enhancer regions and sequestrates the transcription factors TEAD1, TAZ and other co-activators to activate downstream gene expression.

On the other hand, acute hypoxia causes redox imbalance and the condensation of glycolytic enzymes that switches the metabolic pathway to efficiently produce energy via glycolysis80 (Fig. 5d). In budding yeast, a drop in cytosolic pH promotes an overall transition of the cytoplasm from a liquid to a glass-like state. This shifts the cell into a dormant state of cell-cycle arrest and reduced metabolic activity81 (Fig. 5e). Also, an acute change of the extracellular ion/salt concentration causes osmotic stress, which disrupts the intracellular electrostatic balance and leads to cell swelling or shrinkage. For example, RAD23B can undergo phase separation with ubiquitin chains in vitro via a multivalent interaction, and can form hyperosmotic stress-responsive puncta in cells82. Moreover, the osmotic stress-responsive multivalent interactions of LLPS-driving proteins83, including the mechanosensing transcription factors YAP/TAZ84 and the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase ASK3 (ref. 85), can compensate for cell-volume changes86 (Fig. 5f). Notably, although many environmental stresses can lead to phase separation and the formation of cellular condensates, these SGs may be drastically different in their components, properties and so on.
Connect phase separation to biological functions
How do we prove that phase separation is sufficient and necessary for fulfilling certain biological functions? This is a frequently asked question, and indeed it is a critical one for the whole field. To make such a connection for specific proteins, mutants are employed that destroy the phase-separation ability of a component while theoretically maintaining its other native properties. Small molecules, such as 1,6-hexanediol, are frequently used to melt phase-separated condensates, but related experiments have to be designed carefully (Box 3). Disturbance of the original biological function may thus originate from a phase-separation defect. A molecular grafting experiment can demonstrate this point. In other words, to test whether a critical
function of a protein is due to its phase-separation capability, we can replace its phase-separation domain with an orthogonal one, but with similar phase-separation properties, and see whether the function is maintained87. Sequences from different species are often used to avoid local interactions88,89. For example, the prion-like domain in FCA (flowering control locus A) from Arabidopsis thaliana can be used to replace potential phase-separating sequences in mammalian studies90. Besides grafting, an alternate approach is to use a light-inducible condensate system, termed ‘Optogranule’. Target proteins are fused with light-sensitive proteins, such as Cry2, iLID and SspB, the oligomerization of which can be induced by light at a specific wavelength. Such engineered condensates can be used to control phase separation and evaluate their performance in specified biological functions91,92.
Concluding remarks
In this Perspective we have aimed to set up a few rules to help biologists with the understanding and subsequent study of phase separation. However, there are far more mysteries behind phase separation and the formation of MLOs. ‘Phase-separated condensates’ and ‘aggregation’ are a perplexing pair of concepts. Molecules in phase-separated condensates are in a more homogeneous and reversible state, whereas aggregates represent a more amorphous, heterogeneous and less reversible state. In addition, phase separation is not the only mechanism that drives the formation of MLOs, and the role of phase separation in relation to various biological functions remains highly controversial. For example, the role that LLPS plays in transcription activation is under extensive debate47,93 and warrants further investigation. In summary, we propose that phase separation represents a large group of phenomena for clustering of macromolecules in cells, but is definitely not universal or exclusive. More mechanistic investigations are urgently required to explain experimental results and precisely define concepts in this field. Moreover, future studies of phase separation should proceed from cells to the tissue or organism level. Understanding the role of phase separation in higher and more complex physiological functions, including in vivo studies in multicellular organisms, is a challenging but urgent future direction. A more panoramic view might be required to develop cures for diseases originating from abnormal phase separation, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and so on.

Box 3
Experiments using 1,6-hexanediol must be designed carefully
1,6-Hexanediol (1,6-HD), an aliphatic alcohol, is widely used to study the physical properties of membrane-less organelles. 1,6-HD was originally noticed for its ability to melt the nuclear pore and later RNA granules96,97. Since then, 1,6-HD has been widely used as an inhibitor and indicator of phase separation, even though the mechanism by which it disrupts condensates is not thoroughly understood. A few aliphatic alcohols, including 1,6-HD, 2,5-hexanediol and 1,5-pentanediol, were tested for their ability to melt MLOs, LCD fibers and liquid-like droplets. 1,6-HD turned out to be the most potent one. It is suggested that 1,6-HD interferes with the weak hydrophobic protein–protein or protein–RNA interactions that are required for these condensates to form98. Here we raise a significant concern about the limitations and cellular effects of 1,6-HD when it is applied to phase-separation studies. Improper treatment with 1,6-HD may trigger apoptosis or non-apoptotic cell death99,100. We recommend sufficient controls and careful usage of 1,6-HD in cellular phase-separation research. The cell state should be closely monitored during the experiments. Other aliphatic alcohols, such as 2,5-hexanediol and/or 1,5-pentanediol, should be included as controls, to avoid cell death due to an overly high concentration or extra long-term treatment.
