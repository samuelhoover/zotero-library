Numerical simulations of the surface morphological evolution of uniaxially stressed elastic crystalline solids have demonstrated that in addition to Asaro-Tiller/Grinfeld (surface cracking) instabilities, long-wavelength perturbations from the planar surface morphology can trigger a tip-splitting instability that causes formation of a pattern of secondary ripples, which cannot be explained by linear stability theory. In this study, we develop a weakly nonlinear stability theory, which can explain the occurrence of such secondary rippling instabilities and predict the number of secondary ripples that form on the surface as a function of perturbation wavelength. The theory shows that this type of surface pattern formation arises entirely due to the competition between surface energy and elastic strain energy, regardless of surface diffusional anisotropy or the action of externally applied fields. The origin of secondary rippling is explained through nonlinear terms included in the analysis which generate sub-harmonic ripples in the surface morphology with wave numbers that are multiples of the original surface perturbation wave number. Based on the weakly nonlinear theory, we have developed simple analytical expressions that predict the critical wavelength for the onset of secondary rippling, the increase in the number of secondary ripples with increasing perturbation wavelength, and how the onset of the secondary rippling instability and the rippled surface pattern are affected by surface diffusional anisotropy and the action of an applied electric field. The conclusions of the theory are validated by systematic comparisons with results of self-consistent dynamical simulations of surface morphological evolution. CV 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

I. INTRODUCTION
The surface morphological response of stressed elastic solids1–3 is a fundamental surface physics problem that also has major technological importance. In modern electronic and nanofabrication technologies, solid materials involved are stressed due to the thermomechanical conditions of processing or device operation and they may undergo instabilities and evolve morphologically under such conditions that promote surface diffusional transport. Understanding the underlying morphological dynamics is very important in developing strategies to stabilize surface morphology or to control surface patterns that may form after such stressinduced instabilities. An example of such a surface morphological response in a stressed elastic solid is the Asaro-Tiller/Grinfeld (ATG) instability. This problem was first addressed by Asaro and Tiller,4,5 who developed a two-dimensional model and recognized that the instability was caused by the competition between the elastic strain energy and the surface energy. Grinfeld6,7 later formulated this problem on the basis of thermodynamic stability arguments and studied this instability in various solid configurations. A large number of experimental8–16 and theoretical17–24 studies have been conducted in order to characterize and understand fundamentally surface morphological instabilities in stressed elastic solids. In
earlier studies, we focused on the stabilization of the surface morphology of stressed elastic crystalline solids using externally applied fields, such as electric fields and thermal gradients, and accounting for surface diffusional anisotropy.25–29 We developed a linear stability theory (LST), validated it by comparing its predictions with results of self-consistent dynamical simulations according to a fully nonlinear model, and established based on the theoretical predictions strategies for stabilizing the planar surface morphology by using properly directed and sufficiently strong external fields.25–29 Although LST is successful in predicting the onset of the ATG instability, as well as the critical strength of the external fields required for the complete stabilization of the planar surface of the stressed elastic solid, it cannot explain complex nonlinear dynamical phenomena observed in the dynamical simulations, such as the formation of a pattern of secondary surface ripples for long-wavelength surface perturbations.25,30,31 This tip-splitting instability, which leads to formation of shorter-wavelength ripples, is different from the ATG instability and has been reported in continuum mechanical theoretical and simulation studies.18,22 However, the origin of the secondary rippling instability has not been investigated and the surface morphological dynamics after the instability is triggered and has not been characterized or explored systematically. Our numerical simulation studies of the secondary rippling instability30,31 characterized the resulting surface patterns and examined the effects of surface

diffusional anisotropy, application of electric fields, and initial surface perturbation wavelength and amplitude. Nevertheless, an analytical theory of secondary rippling that elucidates the origin of the instability and can guide simulation and experimental studies for additional insights into the nature and character of the instability is still lacking. The purpose of this article is to develop an analytical theory for the secondary rippling instability on the surface of a stressed elastic solid that can capture the rippled surface pattern formation and predict the critical wavelength of the initial perturbation for the onset of secondary rippling, as well as the final number of ripples formed per original perturbation wavelength. In Section II, we conduct a weakly nonlinear stability analysis, based on regular perturbation theory, and obtain an analytical expression for the evolving surface morphology that is accurate up to second order. The asymptotically derived height function reveals the excitation of the second sub-harmonic or, in other words, secondary ripple formation, starting with a long-wavelength planewave perturbation of the surface morphology. We derive a simple analytical relation for the number of ripples formed on the surface as a function of the initial perturbation wavelength and examine how this relation is affected by surface diffusional anisotropy and electric field action. In Section III, we assess and validate our theoretical findings by comparing the theoretical predictions with the results of systematic protocols of self-consistent dynamical simulations based on the fully nonlinear model of surface morphological response. The major conclusions of our study are summarized in Section IV.
II. SURFACE EVOLUTION MODEL AND WEAKLY NONLINEAR STABILITY THEORY
We analyze the driven morphological evolution of the planar surface of a strained bulk solid based on a fully nonlinear continuum model of surface mass transport. We consider a two-dimensional semi-infinite elastic body with a traction-free surface. At a later stage in the analysis, we will take this solid material to be single-crystalline and electrically conducting; these further specifications will be required in order to account for the effects of surface diffusional anisotropy and surface electromigration due to the action of an externally applied electric field, respectively. The elastic body is subject to a uniaxially applied tensile stress of magnitude r1, directed along the x-axis of a Cartesian frame of reference, and extends infinitely in the y-direction as shown in Fig. 1. The surface atomic flux, Js 1⁄4 Jss^, can be expressed by a Nernst-Einstein equation as
Js 1⁄4  Dsds
XkBT
@l
@s : (1)
In Eq. (1), Ds is the surface atomic diffusivity, ds/X is the number of surface atoms per unit area, X is the atomic volume, kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, T is the temperature, l is the chemical potential of a surface atom, and s is the arc length along the surface with s^ being the corresponding unit tangent vector in a two-dimensional (2D) representation assuming no variations in the surface morphology along z.
Assuming further that the solid material responds to stress according to isotropic linear elasticity, we can express the chemical potential l as17
lðxÞ 1⁄4 l0 þ cXjðxÞ þ X
2M r2
ssðxÞ; (2)
where l0 is the chemical potential for a perfectly planar unstressed surface, c is the isotropic surface free energy per unit area,32,33 j is the local surface curvature, the elastic modulus M 1⁄4 4lL (kL þ lL)/(kL þ 2lL), where kL and lL are the material’s first and second Lame parameters, respectively,26–28 and rss is the local stress component tangential to the surface. The assumption of linear elasticity is very satisfactory because strains that are sufficiently high to induce nonlinear elastic response are far removed from the low-strain range of interest here. We parameterize the surface morphology using the height function, y 1⁄4 hðx; tÞ, with hðx; tÞ 1⁄4 0 corresponding to the planar surface morphology. The local curvature is expressed as j 1⁄4 (@2h/@x2)/[1 þ (@h/@x)2]3/2. The evolution of the surface height, i.e., morphology, is governed by the continuity equation for mass conservation1

with a low-amplitude plane-wave perturbation, hðx; 0Þ 1⁄4 D0 exp ðikxÞ with D0  1, and perform weakly nonlinear stability analysis based on regular perturbation theory, where an identified small parameter, e, is used for asymptotic expansion of the height function. From LST used in our previous studies,25,30,31 we know that for a lowamplitude shape perturbation, the strained planar surface is stable for perturbation wave numbers k > 2 (for isotropic surface diffusion in the absence of an applied electric field) and unstable for long-wavelength perturbation, k < 2, due to the ATG instability; the ATG instability can be inhibited by applying an external electric field stronger than a critical value predicted by LST.25,30,31 In simulation studies,30,31 we have also observed a secondary rippling instability, i.e., formation of secondary ripples in the surface morphology triggered by a tip splitting instability, for surface perturbations with wavelengths longer than a critical value, i.e., for wave numbers k < kc,r < 2, where kc,r is the critical wave number for secondary rippling instability. For plane-wave surface perturbations with such wave numbers, k < kc,r, we observed secondary ripple formation which ultimately leads to surface cracking due to the ATG instability; kc,r has not been predicted analytically but only estimated numerically.30,31 Even under the application of an external electric field with strength weaker than that required for surface stabilization against the ATG instability, we observed secondary ripple formation that triggered an ATG instability for long-wavelength perturbations which would otherwise lead to stable morphological response according to LST. Numerical studies30,31 have shown that in all of the above cases, kc,r < 1 with kc,r being close to 1 in the absence of an external field. Our weakly nonlinear theory aims at predicting analytically the onset of the secondary rippling instability. Therefore, we will focus on an initial shape perturbation with k 1⁄4 O(1) and identify the small parameter e  D0, i.e., the amplitude of the initial surface perturbation made dimensionless with the length scale l. The surface morphological response will be characterized by an amplitude DðtÞ (to leading order, giving the full morphology h if multiplied by a bounded function of k) that we will not monitor in the theory when it becomes higher than O(e). Consequently, in our analysis, h, @h=@x, @2h=@x2, @3h=@x3, and @4h=@x4 will be of O(e). We can then represent the height function h by an asymptotic expansion in e as
h 1⁄4 hð0Þ þ ehð1Þ þ e2hð2Þ þ Oðe3Þ: (5)
In the power series of Eq. (5), hð0Þ 1⁄4 0 corresponds to the base state of the planar surface morphology. While in linear stability analysis, we are only interested in the evolution of the O(e) term, hð1Þ, here we also are interested in the evolution of hð2Þ and potentially higher-order terms. In this study, we will limit our weakly nonlinear analysis retaining up to O(e2) terms, which will suffice to predict the onset of secondary rippling. Neglecting O(e3) and higher-order terms simplifies the governing equation, Eq. (4), further to

In Eq. (6), the stress component and the curvature depend explicitly on the surface morphology (height function) and can also be represented as asymptotic expansions in e.

The solution of our conditional (asymptotic) stability theory, Eq. (12), is valid only under the low amplitude assumption. As the amplitude of the perturbation grows, the prediction of Eq. (12) for the surface morphology will become increasingly inaccurate, since the weakly nonlinear solution of Eq. (12) cannot predict the full dynamics (well beyond the instability onset) of the surface morphological evolution, which is strongly nonlinear in nature. However, the retention of O(e2) terms in the height function gives more accurate predictions for the surface morphology than those of the LST and can explain the secondary ripple formation, which we discuss next. Specifically, in Eq. (12), we observe that in addition to the initial perturbation, namely, a plane wave of wave number k, a second sub-harmonic wave, with wave number 2k, i.e., twice as large as that of the initial perturbation, has been excited in the evolution of the surface morphology and appears in the height function due to the contribution of the O(e2) terms in the governing equation. If the evolution rates of the initial surface perturbation and the secondary sub-harmonics are negative, which is the case when k > 2, the surface perturbation will decay to return to the planar surface morphology that is stable. As a result, neither the ATG instability nor the secondary rippling instability will be manifested in this case. If, on the other hand, the evolution rate of the initial perturbation is positive, but that of the induced second sub-harmonic (of wave number 2k) is negative or slow compared to the original perturbation (of wave number k), which is the case when kc,r < k < 2, we will still not be able to observe the secondary ripple formation. If the evolution rates of both the initial perturbation and the induced secondary wave are positive, which is the case when k < kc,r, the amplitudes of both the primary perturbation wave and the secondary sub-harmonic wave will grow; this will trigger both the ATG instability and the secondary rippling instability simultaneously. So far, we have limited our weakly nonlinear theory to O(e2) terms only and, hence, the induced secondary ripple, as predicted by Eq. (12), is the only sub-harmonic of the initial perturbation appearing in the solution for the surface morphology. The significance of including this O(e2) contribution to the analysis is that it provides analytical understanding about the origin of the secondary wave, through the second sub-harmonic for simple plane-wave shape perturbation, an important physical insight into the origin of the
secondary rippling instability. To analytically predict the number of secondary ripples formed starting from a simple plane-wave perturbation, we need to extend the weakly nonlinear theory to increasingly higher order terms, O(en) with n > 2, and evaluate the evolution rates of all the resulting sub-harmonics. Such an analysis constitutes a rather tedious mathematical task due to the increased complication in formulating and solving the O(en) with n > 2 problems. Nevertheless, the insights obtained by the O(e2) contribution to the analysis can be used to postulate an ansatz, whose validity can be tested by systematic comparisons with results of self-consistent numerical simulations, i.e., with fully nonlinear analysis. This ansatz consists of three statements:
(1) All the sub-harmonics of the basic plane-wave perturbation are excited, due to the O(en) with n > 2 contributions to the weakly nonlinear analysis, and, after the surface morphology starts evolving in response to the perturbation, the height function can be represented in the low-amplitude limit as the superposition of all the sub-harmonic waves, i.e.,
hðx; tÞ 1⁄4 D1 expðxð1Þ
1 tÞ expðikxÞ
þ D2 expðxð2Þ
1 tÞ expð2ikxÞ
þ D3 expðxð3Þ
1 tÞ expð3ikxÞ þ    ; (13)
(2) Each (sub-)harmonic (wave number nk; n 1⁄4 1, 2, 3,...) evolves practically independently from the others and its
evolution rate, xðnÞ
1 , is that predicted by LST for the corresponding wave number nk; and, (3) After sufficiently long time, the surface morphology is dominated by the sub-harmonic with the fastest growth
rate, i.e., if xðnÞ
1 is the fastest of the sub-harmonic growth rates then n ripples per original wavelength will eventually be observed.
The first two statements are supported by the mathematical structure of the O(en) problems in the weakly nonlinear analysis. The third statement is supported by the low amplitude of the perturbation in a conditional (asymptotic) stability analysis. This low amplitude results in incremental changes in the morphology at the initial stage of evolution, prolonging the time to failure (surface cracking), which enables higher-order unstable sub-harmonics to evolve and eventually dominate the surface morphology. It should be emphasized that although the sub-harmonic ripple evolution rates are satisfactorily approximated by the LST, the solution structure of Eq. (13) given by the superposition of all the sub-harmonic ripples would not have been considered without the findings of the weakly nonlinear analysis, Eq. (12) and accompanying results, which reveal the excitation of sub-harmonic ripples in the surface morphological response. Based on the above three statements, we can establish simple analytical relations between the initial perturbation wave number and the number of the secondary ripples (ripples per original wavelength of shape perturbation) manifested in the evolving surface morphology. According to the LST, the evolution rate of the nth (sub-)harmonic is

15  0:933, which corresponds to the upper bound on k in Eq. (15) for n 1⁄4 2 (the minimum number of ripples per original wavelength for “tip splitting in two” and onset of secondary rippling). In the remainder of our theoretical analysis, we increase the complexity of the dynamical system under consideration but limit the results of the weakly nonlinear theory to the outcomes of the ansatz that we postulated based on the theory, Eqs. (14) and (15). So far, we considered in our analysis the surface atomic diffusivity Ds to be isotropic. Next, we account for surface diffusional anisotropy expressed by the well-established anisotropy function for face-centered cubic (fcc) metals f(h) 1⁄4 1 þ A cos2[m(h þ /)]  1,32–35 where h 1⁄4 tan1ðdy=dxÞ is the surface orientation angle. It should be mentioned that the diffusional, i.e., kinetic, anisotropy is by far the dominant anisotropy among properties of materials, such as fcc metals, compared to anisotropies in thermodynamic or mechanical properties;1,34,35 therefore, all other materials properties in this study are approximated satisfactorily as isotropic. In this parameterization of the anisotropy function, A > 0 is the strength of the anisotropy, m is the number of symmetry directions of fast surface diffusion, and / is the misorientation angle of a symmetry direction with respect to the x-direction, which is the direction of the imposed external fields in the case under consideration, as seen in Fig. 1; m 1⁄4 1, 2, and 3 correspond to h110i-, h100i-, and h111i-oriented surfaces, respectively. The surface diffusivity can be expressed as Ds 1⁄4 Ds(h) 1⁄4 Ds,min f(h), where Ds,min is the minimum surface diffusivity; for anisotropic surface diffusion, Ds,min is the value of the surface diffusivity used in the definition of the time scale s. In such a case, according to the LST result of Ref. 25 (in the absence of an applied electric field), Eq. (14) can be written as
xðnÞ
1 1⁄4 ðnkÞ4f ðh 1⁄4 0Þ þ 2ðnkÞ3f ðh 1⁄4 0Þ; (16)
while the result of Eq. (15) for the perturbation wave number range that results in a certain number of secondary ripples does not change. This implies that surface diffusional anisotropy does not affect the final number of ripples forming per original perturbation wavelength. However, Eq. (16) implies that anisotropy does affect the perturbation growth rate by a factor of f(h 1⁄4 0) 1⁄4 1 þ A cos2(m/)  1. This implies that surface diffusional anisotropy will accelerate the surface
morphological evolution, thus the secondary rippling phenomenon is expected to occur sooner in a crystalline material than in the case of an isotropic solid. To analyze the formation of secondary ripples under the application of an electric field that also induces electromigration on the surface of a crystalline solid conductor, we again rely on the outcomes of the ansatz based on the weakly nonlinear theory. In this case, according to the LST of Ref. 25, the result of Eq. (16) can be written as

electric field helps stabilize the rippling instability by reducing the range of wave numbers that can cause secondary rippling. Moreover, an electric field with larger-than-critical strength, NE > NE;c, as predicted by the LST,25,30,31 can inhibit both the secondary rippling and the ATG instability. However, under the application of an electric field with weaker-than-critical field strength, NE < NE;c 1⁄4 0:194 for this set of anisotropy parameters, the rippling instability will still be triggered for perturbations with k < kc,r. This rippling pattern can be best explained through the dispersion curves of Fig. 2 for a representative set of surface diffusional anisotropy parameters. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the dispersion curve for the ATG instability under isotropic surface diffusion, NE 1⁄4 0 and A 1⁄4 0, where every longwavelength perturbation with wave number k < 2 is unstable. For an applied electric field with strength NE 1⁄4 1:1NE;c, i.e., stronger than the critical value required to stabilize the surface, with dispersion curve (2), x < 0 resulting in perturbation amplitude decay for every perturbation wave number k and stabilization of any morphological disturbances. In the dispersion curve of case (1), the applied electric field has strength NE 1⁄4 0:88 NE;c, i.e., the field is weaker than that required to stabilize the planar surface morphology. Hence, there exists a range of perturbation wave numbers for which x > 0 and the planar surface morphology is unstable according to LST. However, for very-long-wavelength perturbations, with wave numbers between 0 and the first nonzero root of x(k) 1⁄4 0, the perturbation evolution rate is x < 0, i.e., the planar surface morphology is stable according to LST. In such cases, our weakly nonlinear theory predicts that the low-k linearly stable perturbation can induce unstable subharmonics that can trigger the ATG instability mediated by the secondary rippling instability; e.g., a perturbation with k 1⁄4 0.4 will induce the unstable sub-harmonics of 2k 1⁄4 0.8 and 3k 1⁄4 1.2, as shown by the dashed vertical lines in Fig. 2.
Our theory also predicts that of the two unstable subharmonics, the one with wave number 3k 1⁄4 1.2 has the highest growth rate according to LST and, therefore, three secondary ripples are expected to form per original wavelength of the initial perturbation with k 1⁄4 0.4 prior to growth of the perturbation amplitude to cause surface cracking due to the ATG instability as the driven surface morphological evolution proceeds. In Section III, the theoretical predictions of the weakly nonlinear stability analysis will be tested and validated based on self-consistent dynamical simulations according to the fully nonlinear surface evolution model.
III. SELF-CONSISTENT DYNAMICAL SIMULATIONS OF SECONDARY RIPPLING INSTABILITY
We have carried out self-consistent dynamical simulations based on the fully nonlinear model of Eqs. (1)–(3), coupled with the elastostatic and electrostatic boundaryvalue problems (BVPs); when the action of an externally applied electric field is accounted for, the driving force in Eq. (1) for the surface atomic flux is augmented by the electromigration force, Esqs , where Es is the component of the electric field tangent to the surface, in addition to the chemical potential gradient. In the simulations, the evolving surface morphology is expressed by using a local coordinate system ðs^; n^Þ with s^ and n^ being the unit tangent and unit normal vectors at a point on the surface, s^  n^ 1⁄4 0, and the surface is discretized adaptively during its driven evolution. The electrostatic potential (U) and elastic displacement (u) fields are computed by solving the electrostatic and elastostatic BVPs, respectively, described in Refs. 1, 32, and 33 through a Galerkin boundary-integral method32,33,36 coupled self-consistently with the evolving surface morphology. The displacement field u is used to calculate the strain tensor field e in the small-displacement kinematic limit and the stress tensor field r is computed from e according to isotropic linear elasticity;32,33,36 at every point on the surface, the electric field E is computed as the local gradient of U.36 The propagation of the surface is monitored using the front tracking method of Refs. 1, 32, 33, and 37 by time stepping Eq. (3) expressed as @un=@t 1⁄4 X@Js=@s, where un is the local displacement component normal to the surface. At a given set of parameters (NE, A, m, /, k), the surface morphology hðx; tÞ is monitored starting from its initial (perturbed from planar) profile hðx; 0Þ 1⁄4 D0 sinðkxÞ with a low perturbation amplitude D0=k 1⁄4 0:001. In previous simulation studies,30,31 we had reported an approximate linear scaling relation between the number of ripples formed (per original perturbation wavelength) and the perturbation wavelength for the characterization of the rippled surface pattern. The simulations conducted in this study aim primarily at validation of the weakly nonlinear theory of Section II and assessment of the accuracy of the detailed analytical results of Eqs. (12), (15), and (18)–(20).
A. Stress-induced secondary, sub-harmonic ripples
Previous simulation studies18,22,25,30,31 have shown or implied that secondary rippling for a long-wavelength surface perturbation originates due to the competition between

The dashed vertical lines indicate that in case (1), where NE < NE;c, an initial perturbation with k 1⁄4 0.4 in the lowk linearly stable region may induce unstable sub-harmonics of 2k 1⁄4 0.8 and 3k 1⁄4 1.2. The inset gives the dispersion relation for NE 1⁄4 0, indicating an ATG surface instability. The surface diffusional anisotropy parameters are A 1⁄4 12, m 1⁄4 3, and / 1⁄4 15.

surface free energy and elastic strain energy, independent of surface diffusional anisotropy or action of externally applied fields other than the mechanical stress. These results are consistent with the findings of our weakly nonlinear theory. Therefore, in our systematic effort to assess the validity of the theory, we initially examined the surface morphological response of a stressed solid where surface diffusion is isotropic and in the absence of any other external fields. Initially, we attempt a direct qualitative comparison of the theoretical prediction of the surface morphology, Eq. (12), with the corresponding simulation prediction. In this attempt, we notice that in using Eq. (12), we neglect all the higherthan-second-order nonlinear terms, which may excite subharmonic ripples with wave numbers higher than 2k for a surface perturbation from the planar morphology with wave number k. These ripples cannot be captured by the truncated form of Eq. (12), which neglects O(e3) and higher-order terms. Therefore, for a meaningful comparison, we should conduct the dynamical simulation at a proper initial perturbation wavelength which, according to the weakly nonlinear theory, can only induce the formation of two ripples per original wavelength, i.e., according to Eq. (15), the range of the chosen wave number k should be 38/65  k  14/15. We choose the initial perturbation wavenumber k 1⁄4 0.91 as a representative example of morphological response. We choose e 1⁄4 0.007 to use a low amplitude and keep the growth rate of the primary harmonic slow, delaying the possibility of surface cracking prior to the formation of any secondary ripples. The snapshots of surface profiles predicted by dynamical simulation and Eq. (12) are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. The low-amplitude sine waves in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) correspond to the initial (perturbed from planar) surface morphology at t 1⁄4 0 and are identical in both cases. The other surface profile in Fig. 3(a) corresponds to the surface morphology at t 1⁄4 4.0 s. The valleys of the initial profile are greatly deepened, developing into the crack-like grooves that are typical of the ATG instability, and each of the surface tips has split into two secondary ripples. The deepening of the valley due to surface diffusion is a mechanism to relieve elastic strain energy and the formation of the cusp-like singularity forming in the bottom of the deep groove is a direct consequence of the stress concentration at this point. The formation of the secondary, sub-harmonic ripples in the hills of the surface morphology is another mechanism to reduce the material’s elastic strain energy. In Fig. 3(b), the evolved surface profile represents the
prediction of Eq. (12) at the same time t 1⁄4 4.0 s. The valleys of the surface profile also have deepened, and the appearance of secondary ripples at the hills of the surface morphology also is evident. In general, there is good qualitative agreement in the shape and location of the ripples in the surface morphology between the analytical prediction and the simulation result. However, at this time, t 1⁄4 4.0 s, the amplitude of the secondary ripples predicted by Eq. (12) as depicted in Fig. 3(b) is much higher than the simulation result as depicted in Fig. 3(a). This discrepancy is not surprising since Eq. (12) is accurate as long as the surface morphology deviates only by a low amplitude from the planar surface, which is violated when the ATG instability is triggered.
B. Secondary rippling instability with isotropic surface diffusion without electric field action
In addition to obtaining a fundamental understanding of the origin of the secondary rippling instability, this study also aims at developing a simple and reliable theory to predict the final number of ripples, n per original perturbation wavelength in the evolved surface morphology; here, we undertake the systematic testing of the theory of Section II. First, we consider the basic case where the elastic solid is only subject to uniaxial stress and surface diffusion is isotropic. In this case, according to the theory, the relation between the final number of ripples, n, and the corresponding range of the initial perturbation wave number k is expressed by the inequalities of Eq. (15). This n(k) relation predicts that n 1⁄4 2 for k 2 ð38=65; 14=15Þ, n 1⁄4 3 for k 2 ð74=175; 38=65Þ, n 1⁄4 4 for k 2 ð122=369; 74=175Þ, n 1⁄4 5 for k 2 ð182=671; 122=369Þ, and so on for more ripples according to Eq. (15). To elucidate the dynamics of secondary (sub-harmonic) ripple formation, we discuss the results of four representative direct dynamical simulations based on the fully nonlinear surface transport model at four different wave numbers as initial surface morphologies perturbed from the planar state. For this basic case, A 1⁄4 0 and NE 1⁄4 0. The simulation results are depicted in Fig. 4. Figures 4(a1)–4(d1) show snapshots from the surface morphological evolution for initial perturbation wave number k 1⁄4 0.75, k 1⁄4 0.44, k 1⁄4 0.34, and k 1⁄4 0.29, respectively. The corresponding surface profiles are shifted upwards as the morphological evolution proceeds, starting from the initial morphology at the bottom of this evolution sequence. Figure 4(a1) shows that the amplitude of the initial perturbation

The initial low-amplitude sinusoidal perturbations are identical in both cases (a) and (b). The evolved surface morphology with the split tip is shown after t 1⁄4 4.0 s for both (a) and (b). Surface diffusional anisotropy effects are neglected in both cases.

grows slowly at the beginning, accompanying the slight morphological change: the valleys become deeper and narrower, while the hills (tips) become broader. Such shape change has been reported previously in the literature,18,22 and is attributed to the nonlinear effect of the mechanical stress. It turns out that this morphological change also is the precursor to secondary rippling. At t 1⁄4 3.71 s (see 4th profile from the top in Fig. 4(a1)), the tip of the evolving wave (per original wavelength) splits into two secondary ripples, each with a wavelength equal to half of that of the original sine wave perturbation. This is evidence of secondary ripple formation in agreement with the theory, Eq. (15), that gives n(0.75) 1⁄4 2. From this point on, the surface morphological evolution is accelerated, with both the original valleys and the newly-formed ones due to the tip splitting deepening fast. The subsequent evolution is dominated by the secondary sub-harmonic, which has a faster evolution rate than the primary perturbation. The surface morphology develops a cusp-like singularity rapidly, without forming any more ripples. Figure 4(b1) shows different dynamics compared to that of Fig. 4(a1). In the beginning of the evolution, the amplitude growth also is slow. While the deepening and narrowing of the valleys of the surface profile occur, the tips are not broadening but sharpening. At t 1⁄4 5.79 s (see 5th profile from the top in Fig. 4(b1)), two shoulders have formed on either side of each tip. This kind of morphology was observed in previous simulation studies29 but the cusp singularity in the valleys was reached before manifestation of the further nonlinear dynamics at the tips of the surface profile. In the simulation of Fig. 4(b1), we slowed down the growth of the perturbation by choosing very low initial perturbation amplitudes. At t 1⁄4 7.08 s (see 2nd profile from the top in
Fig. 4(b1)), it is evident that two new valleys form at each tip. The surface morphology is now characterized by three ripples per original wavelength, each with a wavelength equal to one third of that of the original perturbation. According to our theory, the second sub-harmonic, though it cannot be observed due to its slow growth rate compared to those of the other modes, also has been excited. The surface morphology is still dominated by the form of the third subharmonic, only modulated by the original perturbation and the induced second sub-harmonic. After the formation of the secondary ripples, the evolution (dominated by the excited third sub-harmonics) is characterized by fast growth and the cusp singularity at the valleys of the surface morphology is reached rapidly, without showing any further complex dynamics. The final number of secondary ripples per original wavelength agrees with the prediction of Eq. (15), n(0.44) 1⁄4 3. To explore the extent of validity of our theory, we have examined the evolution of perturbations with increasingly long wavelengths that are expected to lead to the formation of even more ripples according to the theory, which makes the simulation effort increasingly more challenging. The simulation results for k 1⁄4 0.34 and k 1⁄4 0.29 are shown in Figs. 4(c1) and 4(d1), respectively. As expected, we observe the formation of the secondary ripples, with n(0.34) 1⁄4 4 and n(0.29) 1⁄4 5 as predicted by the theory, and the formation of the cusp-like features in the valleys of the surface morphology after the formation of the ripples. However, two additional dynamical features also are worth noticing. The first is that for the longer-wavelength perturbations, it takes longer time for the secondary ripples to form. This is partly because the longer-wavelength perturbation results in slower growth rate according to the linear theory and partly because the dominant sub-harmonic is the higher-order one induced by

In (a2), (b2), (c2), and (d2), magnified views are depicted of the regions marked by the rectangles in (a1), (b1), (c1), and (d1), respectively, highlighting the resulting tip-split surface morphologies characterized by certain patterns of secondary ripples.

the higher-order nonlinearities. Due to the low perturbation amplitude, it takes longer for the higher-order nonlinearities to cause any observable effects on the surface morphology. The second dynamical feature is that for the very longwavelength perturbations examined in these cases, the secondary ripples form not only at the tips but also at the valleys of the surface profile, as shown by the snapshots at t 1⁄4 9.10 s (see 5th profile from the top in Fig. 4(c1)) and t 1⁄4 9.09 s (see 4th profile from the top in Fig. 4(d1)), respectively. In other words, both tip and valley splitting are exhibited in these cases. This is because, for the very-long-wavelength perturbation, the valley regions are very broad and the local strain energy in these regions cannot be reduced sufficiently by the deepening of the valleys. Splitting in these regions occurs under the action of the local stress field. The ripples that form in the valley regions grow faster than those forming in the tip regions. If the initial perturbation amplitude is not sufficiently low, the ripples forming in the valley regions may grow to form cusp-like singularities very quickly, even before any secondary ripples form in the tip regions. This was shown in an earlier study30,31 where D0=k 1⁄4 0:01 was used and resulted in observation of fewer ripples in the simulation than the present theory predicts. Figures 4(a2)–4(d2) give magnified views of the boxed regions marked in the surface profiles of Figs. 4(a1)–4(d1), respectively, to highlight the detailed features of the rippled surface morphology. Since surface diffusion is isotropic, the rippled surface profile per original wavelength retains its symmetry with respect to the y-axis in the morphologies of Figs. 4(a2) and 4(b2). However, this symmetry is broken in the simulated rippled surface morphologies of Figs. 4(c2) and 4(d2), where some ripples have already evolved toward a cusp-like singularity, while others have just formed. This is because the longer the initial perturbation wavelength, the stronger the nonlinear effect and the farther the surface morphology deviates from the weakly nonlinear prediction. An important capability of the secondary rippling theory of Section II is that it predicts a sequence of critical initial perturbation wave numbers that trigger the formation of n 1⁄4 2, 3, 4,... secondary sub-harmonic ripples per original perturbation wavelength, starting from kc,r that corresponds to n 1⁄4 2. To assess the predictive capabilities of the theory, we have conducted a series of simulations, in all of which perturbations from the planar surface morphology with the low amplitude D0=k 1⁄4 0:001 are used. All of the simulations are fully self-consistent, and are terminated when the cusp-like singularity is approached. We record the number of ripples per original wavelength in the last snapshot of the simulated morphological evolution, as discussed for the morphologies of Fig. 4, and plot all of these numerical simulation results in Fig. 5 denoted by open circles as a function of the original perturbation wavelength, k 1⁄4 2p=k, scaled with the maximally unstable wavelength kmax as expressed in Refs. 19 and 22. For comparison purposes, the theory predictions according to Eq. (15) also are plotted in Fig. 5 denoted by solid lines. In the absence of an electric field action, the maximally unstable wavenumber is kmax 1⁄4 3/2, yielding kmax 1⁄4 4p=3  4:19. It is evident from Fig. 5 that the theoretical predictions for n(k) are in very good agreement with
the simulation results, especially for the lower-n subharmonics. The most important critical parameter, the critical initial perturbation wavenumber for the occurrence of the rippling instability, kc,r, is predicted by the theory to be 14/ 15  0.93, in excellent agreement with kc;r  0:98 predicted by the numerical simulations. This error is 5% with the error for the theoretical prediction of the critical k for the formation of three secondary ripples being <10% and the predictions becoming less accurate for n 1⁄4 4, 5, etc., for the reasons mentioned in the discussion of the nonlinear dynamics captured by the simulation results of Fig. 4.
C. Secondary rippling instability with anisotropic surface diffusion without electric field action
To account for the effects of surface diffusional anisotropy on the secondary rippling instability and test the predictive capabilities of our theory when such anisotropy is important, which is the case for crystalline solids, we have conducted a systematic protocol of dynamical simulations using the three-parameter anisotropy function f(h) typical of fcc metals. Here, we present representative simulation results for the set of anisotropy parameters A 1⁄4 12, m 1⁄4 3, and / 1⁄4 15; typically, A 1⁄4 O(10),1,34,35 m 1⁄4 3 corresponds to a h111i-oriented surface, which is a common surface orientation for surface science studies in fcc metals, for which the range of / is (60, 0], i.e., 60 intervals due to symmetry for this crystallographic orientation. According to the theoretical analysis of Section II, the domains of k corresponding to formation of a certain number n of secondary ripples are not affected by the surface diffusional anisotropy. In the simulations, we use the same low amplitude of initial perturbation from the planar surface morphology, D0=k 1⁄4 0:001, and choose the same set of initial perturbation wavelengths as in the case where surface diffusion was considered to be isotropic. Figures 6(a1)–6(d1) depict snapshots from the surface morphological evolution for the initial perturbation wave numbers k 1⁄4 0.75, k 1⁄4 0.44, k 1⁄4 0.34, and k 1⁄4 0.29, respectively. The simulation results indicate that there are not any major changes in the surface morphological dynamics in the cases of Fig. 6 compared with their counterparts in Fig. 4. The final numbers are n 1⁄4 2, 3, 4, and 5 for the

The initial perturbation from the planar surface morphology is hðx; 0Þ 1⁄4 D0 sinðkxÞ, with D0=k 1⁄4 0:001 at NE 1⁄4 0 in all the simulations. Surface diffusional anisotropy effects are neglected.

morphological response in Figs. 6(a1)–6(d1), respectively, as predicted by the theory, Eq. (15). However, although the surface diffusional anisotropy does not affect the final number of ripples formed, it affects the time when these ripples are formed. Comparing the times corresponding to the snapshots in Fig. 6 with those in Fig. 4, we find that the dynamics of ripple formation and evolution is accelerated by close to an order of magnitude when the surface diffusional anisotropy effects are accounted for. This is because, as seen by comparing the rates of Eqs. (14) and (16), surface diffusional anisotropy accelerates the evolution rate of all the excited harmonics by a factor of f ðh 1⁄4 0Þ, which is equal to 7 for the set of anisotropy parameters used in the simulations that yielded the results of Fig. 6. Our theory, Eqs. (14) and (16), predicts that the growth rate of all the harmonics is enhanced equally due to surface diffusional anisotropy. This is because our theoretical analysis, based on the ansatz following the findings of the weakly nonlinear theory, neglects the nonlinear effects of the surface morphological details on surface diffusional anisotropy at different surface locations. The simulation results demonstrate that the growth rates of all the excited harmonics are indeed enhanced, but by slightly different values. These slight differences in local growth rates will affect the profile features of the evolved surface morphology. As a result, in Figs. 6(a2) and 6(b2), depicting magnified views of the marked regions of Figs. 6(a1) and 6(b1), respectively, the ripples do not exhibit the symmetry with respect to the y-axis exhibited by those in Figs. 4(a2) and 4(b2). Also, the profiles of Figs. 6(c2) and 6(d2) differ from those of Figs. 4(c2) and 4(d2). These differences in the more detailed features of the profiles (other than number of ripples and corresponding wavelengths) are caused by the effects of surface diffusional anisotropy.
To examine quantitatively the effects of the surface diffusional anisotropy on the critical values of the initial perturbation wave numbers that trigger the formation of different numbers of secondary ripples, n, we conducted a systematic protocol of simulations that generated the results of Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, the simulation predictions for the dependence of n on the initial wave number k, expressed again as nðk=kmaxÞ are denoted by open circles with the solid lines representing the predictions of the theory, Eq. (15). There are no major differences in comparing the results of Fig. 7 with those of Fig. 5, confirming based on the dynamical simulations that surface diffusional anisotropy does not impact significantly the n(k) relationship. However, as demonstrated in Figs. 6(a2) and 6(b2), different sub-harmonic ripples will grow at different rates as a result of surface diffusional anisotropy. The faster growing ripples will reach the cusp-like singular morphology

faster, not allowing for the formation of the slower growing ripples prior to failure (surface cracking). Therefore, the predictive capabilities of the theory of Section II are reduced when surface diffusional anisotropy is accounted for, although its main predictions remain in good agreement with those of self-consistent dynamical simulation.
D. Secondary rippling instability with anisotropic surface diffusion and electric field action
Electric fields can drive surface transport due to electromigration, which can be utilized to compete with stressdriven surface diffusion and stabilize a planar surface against the ATG instability.25 Specifically, a larger-than-critical electric field can inhibit the ATG instability for any surface perturbation wavelength.1,25 However, contrary to the prediction of LST, the surface is not stable against longwavelength perturbations that are supposed to decay back to the planar surface over a certain wavelength range (e.g., k < 0.65 in the case of Fig. 2). We have studied thoroughly through self-consistent numerical simulations the surface morphological response under the action of an electric field and over a broad range of wave numbers in surface perturbations from the planar morphology. It is already understood that applying weaker-than-critical electric fields cannot stabilize the planar surface morphology: although it can stabilize over a certain range of long wavelengths, the planar surface against the primary ATG instability, it cannot avoid the splitting of the long-wavelength-perturbed surface into secondary ripples that can then evolve to cause surface cracking instabilities. Here, we aim at analyzing the effects of the electric field action on the secondary rippling instability and test the validity of the theoretical predictions, Eqs. (18)–(20).
The n(k) predictions of the theory of Section II for secondary ripple formation under the action of an electric field are given by Eqs. (18) and (19). For the representative set of surface diffusional anisotropy parameters A 1⁄4 12, m 1⁄4 3, and / 1⁄4 15, the critical electric field strength for planar surface stabilization is NE;c 1⁄4 0:194.30,31 Choosing NE 1⁄4 0:1 and substituting into the n(k) predictions, Eqs. (18) and (19) yield that n 1⁄4 2 for k 2 ð0:51; 0:81Þ, n 1⁄4 3 for k 2 ð0:37; 0:51Þ, n 1⁄4 4 for k 2 ð0:29; 0:37Þ, and n 1⁄4 5 for k 2 ð0:24; 0:29Þ, which shows that the electric field action has reduced the critical values of the sequence of wave numbers for secondary rippling instability as compared to those predicted in the case of NE 1⁄4 0, Eq. (15). The secondary rippling theory of Section II predicts that for weakerthan-critical electric fields, the planar surface is not stable upon the long-wavelength perturbation that implies stable response according to LST. The longer the wavelength of the original perturbation, the higher the number of secondary ripples formed. As we did above, we discuss the results of four representative dynamical simulations with initial perturbation wave numbers of k 1⁄4 0.58, k 1⁄4 0.42, k 1⁄4 0.29, and k 1⁄4 0.25. The corresponding snapshots from the surface morphological evolution are shown in Figs. 8(a1)–8(d1), respectively. As predicted by the secondary rippling instability theory, in all of these four cases, the surface morphological response is unstable with the initial single sine wave perturbation eventually evolving into formation of 2, 3, 4, and 5 secondary ripples per original wavelength, for the cases of Figs. 8(a1)–8(d1), respectively. Contrary to the morphological evolution shown in Figs. 4 and 6, the perturbation amplitudes in the morphological responses of Fig. 8 decay initially before secondary ripples start to form in the surface profile. This is because the ATG instability caused by the initial perturbation can be stabilized by the applied electric field.

When the secondary rippling instability starts to dominate the surface morphological evolution, the perturbation amplitudes start to grow again. Comparing the times for evolution of the surface profiles depicted in Fig. 8 with those of Fig. 6, we see that the dynamics of the four surfaces in Fig. 8 is slower than that of the four surfaces in Fig. 6 in spite of the same set of diffusional anisotropy parameters used in both cases. This is because the electric field is a stabilizing force for the surfaces of Fig. 8 prior to the onset of secondary ripple formation; Eq. (17) shows that the electric field decreases the evolution rate of all of the excited harmonics. However, the application of the electric field will amplify the nonlinear effects in the dynamical system of the evolving surface, enhancing the complexity of the local dynamics at each surface location. Thus, in the magnified views of the final surface morphologies shown in Figs. 8(a2)–8(d2), we see that the detailed rippled morphologies differ farther from those of their counterparts in Figs. 6(a2)–6(d2), respectively, in spite of the agreement in the number (n) and wavelength (k/n) of the ripples formed. Again, in this case of surface and field action, we have conducted a systematic simulation protocol with different initial perturbation wavelengths under the same electric field strength and set of anisotropy parameters. All the simulations are fully self-consistent and are terminated when the cusplike singularity is approached. We record the number of ripples n formed per original wavelength in the final morphology and plot the relationship nðk=kmaxÞ in Fig. 9 denoted by open circles; for the parameters used in these simulations, kmax 1⁄4 4:83. The predictions of the theory, Eqs. (18) and (19), also are plotted in Fig. 9 denoted by solid lines. Although the theory predictions are in reasonably good agreement with the simulation results, this agreement is worse than that exhibited in Figs. 5 and 7, in the absence of the electric field action. This is due to the increased complexity in the nonlinear dynamics as discussed above and beyond the capabilities of the weakly nonlinear theory. However, the weakly nonlinear theory still gives a good prediction of the onset of secondary rippling. In the cases explored in Figs. 8 and 9, the predictions for kc,r are 0.81 and 0.69 according to the theory and numerical simulation, respectively.
In the simulations presented so far, we perturbed a planar surface of a uniaxially stressed solid with a simple planewave perturbation with varied wavelengths and compared the final number of the ripples formed with the prediction of the theory. However, disturbances from the planar morphology of real solid surfaces are usually much more complicated than single plane-wave perturbations. To probe the tip splitting instability leading to secondary ripple formation that is triggered by such a more complicated surface perturbation, here, we carry out a representative simulation with a surface profile perturbed from the planar surface morphology by a superposition of three low-amplitude sub-harmonics. The initial surface profile is given by the height function hðx; 0Þ 1⁄4 D0 cosð2kxÞ þ 0:4D0 cosð3kxÞ þ 0:3D0 cosð5kxÞ, where D0=k 1⁄4 0:001, at NE 1⁄4 0 with k 1⁄4 0:17. In this simulation, for simplicity, surface diffusional anisotropy is not accounted for. The resulting surface morphological evolution is shown in Fig. 10. There are no electric fields applied externally, and the three sub-harmonics in the initial surface shape perturbation have wave numbers of 2k 1⁄4 0:34, 3k 1⁄4 0:51, and 5k 1⁄4 0:85, which are all smaller than the maximally unstable wave number kmax 1⁄4 3/2. According to the LST, all of these three harmonics lead to unstable response. According to our weakly nonlinear stability theory, the critical wave number for secondary rippling instability is kc;r 1⁄4 14=15  0:93. Therefore, all of these three sub-harmonics, with wavelengths longer than the critical one for secondary rippling, will be excited leading to secondary ripple formation due to tip splitting instabilities. Figure 10 shows the initial perturbation as the superposition of the three low-amplitude harmonics at the bottom of the morphological evolution sequence. It is evident that the initial growth rates are low. At t 1⁄4 2.06 s (see 3rd profile from the bottom in Fig. 10), the appearance of five valleys in the surface morphology is visible, and becomes even more pronounced at t 1⁄4 3.20 s (see 4th profile from the bottom in Fig. 10). These five valleys reflect the evolution of the sub-harmonic with wave number 5k 1⁄4 0:85 in the initial shape perturbation. This sub-harmonic has the fastest growth rate among the three waves in the superposition of the initial perturbation, thus producing the dominant features in the evolving surface morphology. At t 1⁄4 4.51 s (see 3rd profile from the top in Fig. 10), tip splitting is observed at the hills of the surface profile, forming secondary ripples. This is in accordance with the prediction of the weakly nonlinear theory: the wave number of the dominant harmonic is 5 k 1⁄4 0.85 < kc,r, triggering the formation of two secondary ripples per original wavelength of this harmonic. Since five wavelengths of the harmonic with wave number of 0.85 are included in the full wavelength of the original perturbation, ten secondary ripples are expected to form as the surface morphology evolves. At t 1⁄4 5.01 s (see 1st profile from the top in Fig. 10), we observe ten ripples, just as predicted by the theory. Also, it is worth noticing that when the ripples form, the growth rates of their amplitude are much faster than those of the three initial harmonics and the cusp-like singularity is reached very fast. Figure 10 demonstrates that the entire morphological evolution of the surface is dominated by the sub-harmonic with wavenumber equal to 5k 1⁄4 0.85. This is because the evolution of this harmonic is much faster than

Solid lines and open circles denote theoretical predictions and simulation results, respectively. The initial perturbation from the planar surface morphology is hðx; 0Þ 1⁄4 D0 sinðkxÞ, with D0=k 1⁄4 0:001 at NE 1⁄4 0:1 for all the simulations. The surface diffusional anisotropy parameters are A 1⁄4 12, m 1⁄4 3, and / 1⁄4 15.

the other two in the initial surface perturbation. According to the evolution of Fig. 4(c1), the time for ripple formation for the sub-harmonic with wave number equal to 2k 1⁄4 0.34 is slightly shorter than 8.23 s, and according to the evolution of Figs. 4(a1) and 4(b1), the time for ripple formation for the harmonic with wave number equal to 3k 1⁄4 0.51 is 5.25 s. Therefore, before the ripples corresponding to exciting these two sub-harmonics can be formed, the dominant one has already formed its ripples (at t 1⁄4 4.51s), which grow very fast and lead to the cusp-like singularity at t 1⁄4 5.01 s.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have considered the surface morphological evolution of a uniaxially stressed solid, with emphasis on establishing an analytical theory of secondary rippling, which can predict the onset of the secondary rippling instability and the number of secondary ripples formed on the surface per original surface perturbation wavelength. Through weakly nonlinear perturbation theory according to a fully nonlinear surface evolution model, we predict the introduction of sub-harmonic ripples in the surface morphology and their dependence on the original surface perturbation wavelength. We have also examined the effects on the predictions of the theory of surface diffusional anisotropy and external electric field action and validated the theoretical predictions by comparison with the results of self-consistent dynamical simulations; the theoretical predictions become less accurate with increasing the initial perturbation wavelength and the complexity of the nonlinear system. Furthermore, we find
that surface diffusional anisotropy does not affect the number of the formed ripples, but it affects the rate of the rippled surface morphological evolution. Moreover, we find that externally applied electric fields can decrease the critical perturbation wave number for the onset of the secondary rippling instability, thus reducing the range of wave numbers that render the surface unstable with respect to secondary rippling. The secondary rippled surface patterns analyzed in our study are not mere theoretical constructions but they have been observed experimentally.9,11,12 In these experimental reports, secondary ripple formation as a result of tip splitting instabilities can be observed in several images showing surface profiles.9,11,12 However, any detailed analyses of such secondary ripple formation and characteristics have not been reported, since these experimental studies focused on explaining surface morphological characteristics based on the ATG instability in a regime where this linear instability is active in conjunction with more complex nonlinear instabilities. In the crystalline materials examined in these experimental studies, surface diffusional anisotropy effects were not analyzed. Furthermore, most of the materials studied experimentally in terms of their surface morphological response to stress and onset of the ATG instability were polymeric crystals and other crystalline insulators,9,11,12 where an electric field action would not be expected to drive any surface transport. Our theoretical predictions can be used to design experimental protocols that can examine systematically stress-induced nonlinear instabilities in elastic solid surfaces and extend such experimental studies to crystalline conductors, where surface anisotropy effects and effects of the action of an electric field simultaneously with mechanical stress can be studied most effectively. The secondary rippling through sub-harmonic surface wave formation investigated in this study is an intriguing example of surface pattern formation, as a result of mechanical stress, and can be exploited in controlling feature size scales in the physical patterning of surfaces by controlling macroscopic forces, such as stresses and electric fields. The weakly nonlinear theory of secondary rippling presented in this study can predict with reasonable accuracy the onset of the secondary rippling instability and the number of secondary ripples formed in the evolved surface morphology of a uniaxially stressed solid, but it cannot predict the exact morphology and dynamics of the rippled surface. Such predictions can be achieved by a theory that captures strongly nonlinear effects and their impact on the surface morphological dynamics with or without surface diffusional anisotropies due to crystalline order or externally applied field action; we are going to report such theoretical developments in a forthcoming publication. Both the predictions of the simple analytical expressions derived in this work based on the weakly nonlinear analysis and future predictions of more powerful nonlinear theories can be assessed systematically through direct self-consistent dynamical simulations; these predictions constitute experimentally testable hypotheses that can be used to design experimental protocols for advancing the science and technology of physical patterning of surfaces.

APPENDIX: CALCULATION OF STRESS COMPONENT TANGENT TO THE SURFACE
The stress component tangent to the surface, rss, in the material system of interest is expressed as
rss 1⁄4 r11 cos2h þ r22 sin2h þ 2r12 sin h cos h; (A1)
where the principal axes 1 and 2 appearing as subscripts in the stress components of Eq. (A1) correspond to the x- and y-axes, respectively, in our Cartesian system of reference, and h is the surface orientation angle. Using the traction-free boundary condition, Eq. (A1) can be simplified into
rss 1⁄4 r11 þ r22: (A2)
For a surface perturbed from the planar morphology by a perturbation with initial amplitude D0  e  1, approximate analytical solutions for r11 and r22, with O(e3) and higherorder terms neglected, have been derived in Ref. 22. Combining these expressions with Eq. (A2) gives
