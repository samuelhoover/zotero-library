abstract
This study is aimed at understanding the complex coacervation of two systems: branched poly(ethyleneimine) with linear poly(D,L-glutamic acid) or poly(D,L-aspartic acid), and identify differences and similarities with previously reported systems. Three different techniques (turbidity, isothermal titration microcalorimetry-ITC and rheology) were used in a comprehensive study of coacervation. Sample turbidity was used to show how various parameters (salt, stoichiometry, pH, temperature) affect complex coacervation. Complex coacervation decreases with increase in salt and coacervate formation is maximum when a 31:69 mol% acid:base ratio is used. Rare in literature phase diagrams revealed that coacervates are formed over a wide range of acid:base ratios (15–88 mol% NHþ
3 groups), significantly broader compared to other systems. ITC was used for the thermodynamic characterization of the complexation between the polyelectrolytes, and showed that complex coacervation is entropy-driven (from the release of counter-ions) and enthalpically unfavored process. Composition and viscoelastic properties of the complex coacervates were examined gravimetrically and through rheology. Coacervate water content depends on the salt concentration and the stoichiometry. Coacervates exhibit a viscoelastic behavior that is dependent on the salt concentration. Master curves that can predict behavior at a wide range of time scales, not accessible by conventional rheological measurements, were created. Ó 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1. Introduction
Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) arise from electrostatic interactions between two oppositely charged polymers mixed in aqueous solution. Under defined conditions, this mixing may result in a spontaneous phase separation phenomenon called complex coacervation. During coacervation a dense polymer-rich phase (coacervate phase) and a very dilute polymer-deficient phase (aqueous phase), which exist in equilibrium, are formed. The importance of complex coacervation is evident in numerous applications including processed food, cosmetics, or microencapsulation [1–4]. Micelles [5], vesicles [6], and hydrogels [7] with coacervate domains/cores have been used for applications such as drug carriers [8] or packaging materials for enzymes [9]. Furthermore, coacervation plays a critical role in a wide range of biological systems such as marine organisms (i.e. tubeworms, mussels) [10,11]. A detailed understanding of this phase separation phenomenon is of fundamental interest and will aid in advancing many of the
emerging applications. To achieve this understanding a number of parameters that affect complex coacervation have to be taken into consideration. The most important of these factors are the ionic strength (salt concentration), the mixing ratio, the pH, the total polymer concentration and the temperature. Molecular characteristics of the polymers used, such as the chain length or the charge density, also influence polyelectrolyte complexation. A significant number of earlier [12–14] and more recent studies [15,16] have described theoretical models that can predict the influence of these parameters on complex formation. Following the initial observation of complex coacervation by Bungenberg de Jong [17], various biomacromolecule [18–20] and synthetic polyelectrolyte systems [21,22] have been used to determine these effects experimentally, with the use of a wide variety of techniques. One of the most commonly used techniques for the study of complex coacervation, due to its simplicity and reliability, is turbidity. Interactions between biological macromolecules including bovine serum albumin [23] and carboxymethylcellulose with proteins (whey protein, gelatin) [24] have been monitored through turbidity measurements. The effects of salt concentration, pH, polyelectrolyte ratio, molecular weight and other parameters were examined for the Poly(Acrylic Acid)(PAA)/Poly(Allylamine Hydrochloride) (PAH) system with the same method [22,25]. Furthermore, extensive phase diagrams for the complexation of

oppositely charged polypeptides have been constructed using turbidity and optical microscopy [26]. Such phase diagrams are rare in literature but very useful tools for the preparation of coacervates from a specific polyelectrolyte pair. Though turbidity can provide a complete understanding of the effect that key parameters have on coacervation it cannot provide sufficient information on the nature of the process. A thermodynamic analysis that will provide information on the driving force of the complexation is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of coacervation. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) is an experimental technique that has been used to provide thermodynamic insights of the complex formation between charged species. Interactions between biomaterials [27], synthetic polymers and biopolymers [28], biomacromolecules and vesicles [29], and also polymers and surfactants [30–33] have been extensively characterized with the use of ITC. The thermodynamic parameters of the interactions between the species, such as the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy changes together with binding constants and ratio have been deduced by the use of appropriate models. The effects that changes in the experimental conditions (e.g. salt, pH, temperature) have on the thermodynamic parameters of the complex coacervation of polypeptides have recently been described in detail [34]. Turbidity and ITC are very useful in understanding the state of a complex coacervation process, but they provide limited information about the properties of the coacervate phases themselves. Rheology, however, is a technique that has been used for that purpose for coacervates formed from biopolymer [35,36] or synthetic polymer systems [37]. For example, in a study of gum Arabic and chitosan electrostatic complexes, formed at different pH values (3.0, 4.5, and 6.0), the rheological and microstructural characteristics of the coacervates were evaluated [38]. In most of the above reports mainly one experimental method or a number of methods focusing on one specific aspect of the complex coacervation phenomenon, were used. Further, these reports show that parameters such as pH, salt or stoichiometry have fluctuating effects on coacervation, depending on the choice of polyelectrolytes making the study of every system relative. Our intention in this report is to study complex coacervation between poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) and poly(D,L-glutamic acid) (PGlu) or poly(D,L-aspartic acid) (PAsp). We believe that in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of complex coacervation of a specific polyelectrolyte pair, that reaches all aspects of the phenomenon and identifies the similarities and differences with other systems, a combination of techniques needs to be used. Therefore, optical microscopy and turbidity are used here for the systematic study of complex coacervation of aqueous polyelectrolyte solutions as a function of: ionic strength, acid:base ratio, total polymer concentration, pH, temperature and chain length. ITC is used to provide a thermodynamic insight of the complexation between these polymers with the use of an empirical extension of a simple ITC binding model that we recently presented [34]. Finally, the composition and rheological properties of the complex coacervates formed with respect to changes in the salt concentration of the mixtures are presented.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
PGlu and PAsp were used as the polyanions and branched PEI as the polycation in this study. Dense aqueous solutions of branched PEI, with average molecular weights (Mn) 60 k, 10 k and 2 k as determined from the provider by GPC, were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. The polypeptides were purchased from Alamanda
Polymers, Inc. The polymers were used as received without any further purification. The molecular characteristics of the polypeptides, as provided by the supplier, are presented in detail in Table 1. The molecular weights (Mn) and the degrees of polymerization of the polypeptides are determined by NMR, while GPC is used for the determination of the polydispersities (Mw/Mn) of the polymers.
2.2. Preparation of the mixtures
Coacervation is achieved by mixing polycation and polyanion aqueous solutions with NaCl solutions. First, separate stock solutions of 1 wt% of each polypeptide are prepared. The pH is then adjusted to 7.0 (or as desired) by adding small amounts of either NaOH or HCl to these stock solutions. Final mixtures of different polyanion/polycation mixing ratios (from 1/9 to 9/1 w/w) and various total polyelectrolyte concentrations (0.01–0.20 wt%) are then prepared. This is achieved by sequential addition of calculated amounts of the polycation (first) and polyanion (second) stock solutions into NaCl solutions with pre-calculated concentrations, to achieve a final salt concentration from 0 to 4000 mM NaCl in the experimental mixtures. Polycations and polyanions used together have similar degrees of polymerization. The polyelectrolyte mixtures are prepared in microcentrifuge vials and are vigorously shaken with a vortex after each separate component is added. The order of mixing is kept the same for all experiments. All complex coacervates are prepared immediately before turbidity measurements and studied at room temperature (25 °C). All water is dispensed from a Milli-Q water purification system at a resistivity of 18.2 MO-cm.
2.3. Turbidity measurements
A plate reader equipped with a UV spectrophotometer (Tecan, Infinite M200) is employed at a wavelength of 500 nm for the turbidity measurements. None of the polypeptides absorb light at this wavelength. The turbidity (T) is defined by T = ln(I/I0), with I0 = incident light intensity and I = intensity of light passed through the sample volume. Turbidity is measured in absorption units (a.u.). For the turbidity graphs that are presented as function of PEI content an average molecular weight of 43 (corresponds to C2H5N) is used for the repeating unit of branched PEI.
2.4. Optical microscopy
An optical microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TE 200) is used to obtain physical images of the coacervate phase before and after coalescence of coacervate droplets. The coacervate mixture (as previously described) is placed on a glass slide to image the droplets. To image the coacervate phase, centrifugation is used to coalesce the coacervate droplets, as referred to in the preparation of PEC nanoparticles [39]. Samples used for imaging are centrifuged for

15 min at 10,000 rpm using a microcentrifuge in order to achieve rapid phase separation. After centrifugation, the supernatant equilibrium sol phase is carefully removed by using a micropipette while the precipitate (white viscous liquid) or the coacervate (transparent gel) is left at the bottom of the vial. The polymer concentration in the coacervate phase is determined by extracting the weight of the polypeptides left after drying, from the weight of the coacervate.
2.5. Rheology
Rheological measurements were performed on a Physica MCR 301 rheometer fitted with a parallel plate geometry (8 mm in diameter). PEI/PGlu or PEI/PAsp coacervate samples were loaded onto the plate and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min. Strain sweep tests were carried out to determine the linear viscoelastic range (0–10%). Oscillatory tests were used to determine the storage modulus (G0) and loss modulus (G00) while varying the frequency from 0.1 to 100 rad/s with a constant strain of 1% or 5%. A steady shear rate sweep was preformed to measure viscosity.
2.6. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
ITC experiments are performed on a VP-ITC apparatus from MicroCal, LLC. Unless otherwise noted, the polyanion is injected in 12 lL aliquots of a 1 mg/mL solution into the 1.44 mL cell. A waiting time of at least 3 min is allowed between injections. A constant stirring is applied with the paddle-shaped tip of the syringe, at a rate of 307 rpm. The syringe contains a 1 mg/mL solution of the polyanion, referred to as the injectant. When polycation is present in the microcalorimeter cell, its concentration is 0.1 mg/mL. In all cases the concentrations in supporting salt and pH’s are identical
in the syringe and cell solutions, in order to minimize interfering heat signal from the dilution of small ions. The cell content is extracted after each coacervation experiment and observed under optical microscope.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Observation of complex coacervation
Mixing of aqueous solutions of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes can result in PEC formation. PECs can be seen in the form of a fluid complex (coacervate) or in some cases as an aggregate solid structure (precipitate). Optical micrographs of polyelectrolyte complexes, before and after centrifugation, formed from PEI and PGlu solutions are depicted in Fig. 1. Mixing of the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in the presence of salt leads to the formation of complex coacervate, which is observed as droplets in the solution (Fig. 1A). After centrifugation the coacervate droplets coalesce forming a dense polymer rich phase, the coacervate phase (Figure D), which exists in equilibrium with a dilute solution phase. In some cases (when PEI and PGlu or PAsp are mixed without the presence of salt and an excess of one of the two polyelectrolytes) a precipitate complex is formed, as shown in Fig. 1B. After centrifugation, precipitates can be seen as a white solid in the bottom of a vial (Fig. 1F). Centrifugation is beneficial as it allows for distinction between coacervates and precipitates (cannot be achieved by physically observing the mixtures-see Fig. 1C and E) and for separating the coacervate phase for further characterization. Shaking of the systems after the centrifugation could lead to redispersion of the precipitate but not of the coacervate phase, due to the high viscosity of the liquid. Mixtures with high salt concentration lead to a single solution phase.

3.2. Effect of polyanion/polycation ratio on salt free systems
The effect of polyacid/polybase ratio on PEC formation, in salt free systems, was investigated with the use of turbidity. Although turbidity is not a quantitative measure of the amount of coacervate formed, changes in the light transmission depend on the size and also on the composition of the formed complex. Therefore, it reflects the extent of PEC formation. First turbidity was employed to study systems of PEI with PGlu or PAsp with different acid:base mol% ratios. The measured turbidity of the polyelectrolyte mixtures as a function of polycation and amine groups content is presented in Fig. 2. In both examples presented in Fig. 2 the highest turbidity is measured when a 31:69 mol% acid:base ratio is used, regardless of the total polymer concentration or molecular weight of the polyelectrolytes. Previous studies on Poly(Allylamine Hydrochloride) (PAH)/ Poly(Acrylic Acid) (PAA) system [22] or polypeptide pairs [26] have shown that the amount of complex formed is related to the number of ionic groups of the polyanion (–COO) and the polycation (—NHþ
3 ) that are available to interact. In all of these systems, oppositely charged polymers with almost identical chain lengths were used. The maximum formation of complex at pH 7.0 was achieved when a 50:50 mol% acid:base ratio was used, in agreement with Sukhisvilli et al. report on PEC formation [40]. In this study, a branched PEI with three types of charged groups (primary, secondary and tertiary amines with pKa values 10.5, 7.5–8.5 and 5.0 respectively) [41,42] is used with a liner polyelectrolyte having only one charged group. The different degrees of ionization of the amine groups (at pH 7.0) and the possible inaccessibility of the ternary amines, due to steric hindrance effects, result in maximum complex at a 31:69 mol% acid:base ratio. Assuming that in coacervates the charges on one polyelectrolyte chain are compensated by charges of opposite sign to maintain electroneutrality, the maximum coacervate peak (Fig 2) can be
used for an estimation of the number of acid:base sites that are charged (–COO or —NHþ
3 ). At the peak (31:69 mol% acid:base ratio) all acid groups are assumed to be charged at pH 7.0. Therefore to achieve electroneutrality only 31 out of the 69 mol% of the base groups is actually charged. This corresponds to a 55% of uncharged base groups. The percentage of uncharged base groups can be calculated in a similar way for various experimental conditions. It is worth mentioning here, that when the number of available charged sites is maximum (31:69 mol% acid:base ratio) a coacervate phase is always observed after centrifugation even with no salt in the mixtures. For all other acid:base ratios a precipitate complex is always formed when no salt is used. Similar behavior has been reported for PAA/Poly(N,N-Di-Methyl Amino Ethyl Methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) [21] and polypeptide systems [26]. In these systems, coacervate complexes were also formed when the availability of charged groups was maximum (50:50 mol% acid:base ratio). The formation of coacervates without the presence of salt was attributed to the weaker interactions between the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes that prevent irreversible precipitation under these conditions. Irrespective of the ratio used the amount of complex formed, as described by turbidity measurements, depends on the molecular weight of the polyelectrolytes (Fig. 2A). More specific, complex formation increases with increasing the chain length of the oppositely charged polymers. Similar behavior has been reported for other systems where the molecular weight of both [26] or only of one [25] of the polyelectrolytes was changed. In these systems, a proportional to the turbidity increase of the yield of the complex was observed. The mixture of polyelectrolytes with the longest chains (displaying the highest measured turbidity) resulted in the formation of the highest amount of PEC. In Fig. 2B turbidity is presented as a function of acid:base ratio for mixtures with different total polymer concentrations. In all of the systems the maximum complex formation, as seen through turbidity measurements, is observed for the 31:69 mol% acid:base ratio. Furthermore, turbidity is increased as the total polymer concentration in the mixtures is increasing. This increase shows a pronounced effect of the total polymer concentration on the PEC formation that can be explained by charge availability. When a higher total polymer concentration is used more oppositely charged sites are available to interact and therefore more complex can be formed.
3.3. Effect of ionic strength on complex formation
The effect of ionic strength on PEC formation (as expressed by the concentration of NaCl in the mixtures) is studied for PEI/PGlu and PEI/PAsp mixtures via turbidity measurements. Characteristic graphs of turbidity, as a function of salt for both systems at 31:69 mol% acid:base ratio and pH 7.0, are presented together in Fig. 3A. The distinction between the different phases (coacervate, solution) is achieved using optical microscopy and physical observation of the mixtures after centrifugation (Fig. 1). As described earlier, when oppositely charged polyelectrolytes are mixed with a 31:69 mol% acid:base ratio and no salt coacervate complexes are formed. In systems prepared with the same ratio and small amounts of salt (up to 80 mM of NaCl) turbidity appears to increase as the salt concentration is increased. This finding is consistent with the observations of Dautzenberg et al. and the shrinkage of PEC that leads to PEC flocculation and increased turbidity [43,44]. Further increase of the salt concentration of the prepared mixtures (from 80 to around 1200 mM of NaCl) leads to a constant decrease in turbidity and therefore the complex formation. This decrease can be explained by the increasing screening effect of the salt on the polyelectrolyte charges that limits the intermolecular electrostatic interactions.

When the salt concentration of the mixtures is increased too much turbidity of the mixtures disappears. The salt concentration above which the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex coacervate cannot be measured any more with the use of turbidity and a single solution phase is always observed (described by the vertical blue and red lines in Fig. 3) defines the coacervate to solution boundary. In a report by Biesheuvel and Cohen Stuart [16] the change from a coacervate to a solution phase was explained using the change in the free energy between polymer chains in the complex and in the solution. This energy change is positive above the critical salt concentration and therefore complex coacervation is prohibited. In the set of comparative experiments presented in Fig. 3A, mixtures of the polycation (PEI) with each of the polyanions (PGlu and PAsp) at a 31:69 mol% acid:base ratio are prepared by employing polyelectrolyte solutions at neutral pH (7.0). As shown, turbidity values obtained by the PEI/PAsp system are higher for all salt concentrations. Furthermore, the coacervate to solution boundary is shifted to lower salt concentrations for the PEI/PGlu system. These differences can be explained by a number of factors. These could include steric effects or variations in charge densities caused by the differences in the length of the side chains of the two polypeptides. The different degrees of dissociation of the polyanions (398 and 1000 for PGlu and PAsp respectively, calculated using the relation pH – pKa = log(a/(1  a)) with a is the degree of dissociation and pKa(PGlu) = 4.4 [45] and pKa(PAsp) = 4.0 [46]) could also be related with the lower turbidity and the shift of the boundaries observed. The effect of ionic strength (expressed by the salt concentration) on the PEC formation is also studied with regard to changes in the molecular weight of the polymers used. Turbidity data of
PEI/PGlu mixtures with various chain lengths as a function of salt concentration are presented in Fig. 3B. The behavior of the systems, as described by turbidity, appears to be similar to the systems presented earlier regardless of the polyelectrolyte chain length. A small increase in turbidity is seen for systems prepared with small amounts of salt (up to 80 mM of NaCl). This is followed by a steady decrease over a wide range of salt concentrations (from 80 to around 1200 mM of NaCl) until no complex formation is possible, due to the high screening effect. Despite the similarities the variation of the polyelectrolyte chain length introduces some significant changes in the systems. When polyelectrolytes with longer chains are used turbidity values for all salt concentrations are higher and the critical salt concentration for the coacervate-solution boundary is shifted to higher values. These observations are in agreement with a recent study [26] on coacervates formed from polypeptides with various chain lengths. In this report, the increase in turbidity and critical salt concentration (of the coacervate-solution boundary), which was seen in systems with longer chains, was explained by the increased cooperativity of the interpolymer interactions and the smaller entropy of the systems. Turbidity curves as a function of salt concentration were established for various acid:base mol ratios and the critical salt concentrations for the precipitate-coacervate and coacervate-solution boundaries were determined. These experimentally determined boundaries were used to create phase change diagrams as a function of PEI content and salt concentration (Fig. 4) for systems of polyelectrolytes with various degrees of dissociation and chain length. Determination of these boundaries is of great importance as they defer depending on the polyelectrolyte pair used for the complexation and can be very useful tools for the preparation of coacervates. As seen in Fig. 4, PECs are formed for a large surplus of either polycation or polyanion. For both systems described in this report the range of acid:base mol ratio for which a precipitate or coacervate is observed is between 15 and 88 mol% (—NHþ

groups). These limits are significantly broader compared to the PAA/PAH system (24–75 mol%) [22] but very close to the ones observed for other polypeptide systems (10–90 mol%) [26]. The critical number of intermolecular interactions between the oppositely charged groups of the polyelectrolytes that is required to form a stable PEC is smaller than the PAA/PAH system and similar to what reported for polypeptide coacervates. The reason that PEC formation cannot be achieved when extreme acid:base ratios are used (higher than 88 or lower than 15 mol%), even at no salt, is redissolution of the PEC upon further addition of polyacid or polybase. In these situations, the polyelectrolyte in excess acts as a multivalent counterion, which introduces a screening effect and finally causes the collapse of the PECs. Such a behavior is analogous to behavior seen in the mixing of flexible linear polyelectrolytes in multivalent salt solutions [47,48]. In the phase regime between 15 and 88 mol% two boundaries are seen, the precipitate-coacervate (which is significantly smaller) and the coacervate-solution. Both boundaries don’t seem to be affected by the acid:base ratio. However, as seen in Fig. 4A, a change in the degree of dissociation of the polyelectrolytes significantly affects the coacervate-solution boundary. Regardless of the acid:base ratio used the boundary is shifted to lower salt concentrations, when the degree of dissociation of the PEI is decreased. A change of the pH of the PEI solution (before mixing) from 7.0 to 8.8 results in a decrease of the number of charged groups (—NHþ
3 ) along the polymer chain. As mentioned earlier, the number of intermolecular electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes depends on the number of available charged sites. Therefore, the interactions between PEI and PGlu are reduced (when pH 8.8 is used) and less salt is required for screening. Thus, lower critical salt concentrations are seen. Similarly, the critical salt concentration for the coacervate-solution boundary is increasing as the polyelectrolyte chain length is increased (Fig. 4B). The increasing strength of interactions, as described above, and the topology of the PECs is the reason for this finding. If the coacervate phase is seen as a dense network of intermolecular interacting polymer chains the density and therefore the cooperativity of the interactions is increased together with an increase in the size of the chains. Therefore, more salt is required
to screen the attractions between the polymers resulting in higher critical salt concentrations. Interestingly, the limits where PECs are formed are affected by the size of the polymer chains. Longer polymer chains appear to have coacervate phases over a broader range of compositions. This observation is in complete agreement with the theoretical predictions on binodal compositions reported in recent studies [21,49].
3.4. Effect of total polymer concentration on complex formation
The effect of salt on the PEC formation was investigated for three PEI/PAsp systems with different total polymer concentrations (0.20, 0.10 and 0.02 wt%). Turbidity data as a function of salt concentration are presented in Fig. 5A for all the polyelectrolyte systems. It is important to emphasize that the concentration of all polyelectrolytes before and after mixing is below the critical overlap concentration (c), as determined using the corresponding intrinsic viscosity-molecular weight relationships [50]. An increase in PEC formation (as reflected by turbidity) with increasing total polymer concentration is observed for all salt concentration, up to the critical salt concentration of the coacervate to solution boundary. As has been noted earlier for the salt-free systems (see Section 3.2) this effect is related to the charge availability. Mixtures with higher polymer concentrations have a higher number of oppositely charged sites available to interact, thus more complex is formed. In addition, the screening effect of salt on the charged sites (that limits complex formation) is decreased when the number of charges increases and the salt concentration remains the same. These findings are consistent with observations of higher PEC volume fractions in more concentrated biomacromolecule complexes [51]. Similar behavior is seen for PEI/PGlu mixtures at the same total polymer concentrations. Although turbidity is very helpful in describing various effects on PEC formation it cannot provide sufficient information about the coacervate droplets that coalesce and form the coacervate phase. Optical microscopy can provide such information. In Fig. 5B images from an optical microscope illustrating coacervate droplets formed from PEI/PAsp mixtures at different total polymer concentration, are depicted.

the droplets with the increase of the concentration is observed. It appears that the higher charge availability in the mixtures with greater total polymer concentrations allows for the creation of larger complex coacervate droplets before the resulting phase separation. Even though both observations described above (increased complex formation or increased size of droplets with higher polymer concentrations) are somewhat expected they can be very useful in applications where the amount or the size of the coacervates plays an important role (such as encapsulation).
3.5. Effect of temperature on complex formation
The influence of temperature on PEC formation has been expressed through a number of effects using a variety of biomaterials [3]. For the case of PEC formation using synthetic polyelectrolytes the effect of temperature has been described in terms of enhanced hydrophobic interactions and polyelectrolyte dissociation [22,26]. Here this effect is described in the same terms for a temperature range of 20–40 °C. To eliminate the effects of ionic strength and pH, first salt free PEI/PGlu systems were investigated (Fig. 6A). Turbidity of systems with different acid:base ratios appears to follow the curves in Fig. 2, where maximum turbidity is observed for 31:69 mol% acid:base ratio. However, no changes in turbidity were observed for all acid:base ratios in this temperature range. The intermolecular interactions between the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes are too strong to be affected by such a temperature change. In fact, the increase of the degree of dissociation of the polyelectrolytes caused by the change in temperature is not sufficient for complex dissolution (seen as decrease in turbidity). Similar behavior has been reported for polypeptide complex coacervates [26]. Notably, a pronounced effect of temperature on PEC formation is observed when salt is introduced into the systems. As seen in Fig. 6B turbidity is decreasing as the temperature is increased,
regardless of the salt concentration used. The presence of salt in the systems weakens the strength of the electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, due to the screening effect. PECs are therefore more sensitive to changes such as the degree of dissociation of the polyelectrolytes, caused by the increase in temperature.
3.6. Thermodynamic characterization of polyelectrolyte complexation
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) is used to characterize the thermodynamics of complex coacervation taking place when PEI and PGlu or PAsp solutions are mixed. An empirical extension of a simple ITC binding model presented recently [34] is successfully used here for the thermodynamic study. In the proposed model two different processes are distinguished. One is microscopic and corresponds to the direct interaction of pairs of electrostatic charges belonging to two different polymeric species. The second process is the formation and dissolution of a coacervate phase occurring when the composition of the solution in polyelectrolytes changes. Both contributions, DQIP for ion pairing and DQc, for coacervation, rely on a set of independent adjustable parameters, which are introduced in a more detailed description later. This allows for a regression procedure of the total heat change DQ = DQIP + DQc against the experimental heat transfers, in the least sum of squares sense. The result of the procedure is illustrated in Fig. 7B, where black squares are data points, and the solid blue line is the solution of the regression DQ. The two contributions DQIP and DQc are represented by the dashed red and dotted green lines, respectively. The corresponding values of the adjustable parameters are presented in Table 2, for different conditions.

ITC consists here in injecting small amounts of a polyanion solution into a larger volume of a polycation solution, while maintaining the temperature of the latter constant. The power needed for a constant cell temperature is recorded with time and yields a thermograph such as Fig. 7A. Each peak is the result of one injection and of the subsequent equilibration of the system. Fig. 7B (black squares) shows the corresponding binding isotherm, i.e. the integration with respect to time of each peak in the thermograph, normalized by the mole quantity of acid groups injected. This yields an energy, which corresponds to the change in enthalpy of the system after each injection, per mole of injectant acid groups. This enthalpy change is plotted against the polyelectrolyte composition. We compare experimental data on the complexation between a polyanion and a polycation against a model allowing for two contributions to the enthalpy of the system. The first contribution is linked to ion pairing (IP – red dashed line on Fig. 7B), defined as the interaction between two electrostatic charges of opposite signs following the reversible reaction:
Polþs þ Polsþ¡PolþPol þ ssþ
where Pol designates charged repeat unit of the polymers and s ions of the supporting salt. Ion pairing is described formally in the same way as ligand-macromolecule binding reactions are modeled in ITC, and has been used frequently for polyelectrolyte interactions studies with ITC [27,52]. It implies the use of three adjustable parameters: a binding constant Ka, a stoichiometry number n (expressed here in acid over base groups molar ratio: n = 1 corresponds to a 50:50 mol% acid:base ratio), and a characteristic enthalpy change per mole of injectant acid groups, DHIP. The knowledge of the binding constant allows for the determination of the Gibbs free energy change DG = RT ln(Ka), where R is the gas constant and T the temperature, and in turn that of the entropic contribution to the binding reaction –TDSIP (from DG 1⁄4 DHIP  TDSIP). This Ion Pairing contribution to enthalpy change translates as a sigmoid-shaped curve on a binding isotherm (see Fig. 7B, red dashed line). The three adjustable parameters have a distinct and easily readable impact on the curve. DHIP is a proportionality factor, and its value corresponds to the asymptote to the curve at low injected amounts. n can be approximately read as the polyelectrolyte composition at the inflexion point of the curve, provided that the values of Ka are large enough, as it is the case in experimental conditions presented here. Ka is linked to how steep the slope of the curve is at this same point: infinitely high values of Ka would result in a step function (DQIP = DHIP for all compositions poorer in acid groups than n -left-hand side of the isotherm-, DQIP = 0 for all others).
The second contribution to the system’s enthalpy is directly linked to the presence of a coacervate phase. Observations of coacervates by turbidity or microscopy, as well as theoretical predictions [26,49], point toward a bell-shaped relationship between the amount of coacervate present in a solution and its relative composition in polyanion and polycation. Thus, and for limiting the number of adjustable parameters, a gaussian function is chosen for this description. The corresponding change in enthalpy (DQc), is the normalized derivative of this function (Fig. 7B, dashed green line). This contribution to heat change has by definition an endothermic and an exothermic part: the heat transferred during the formation of coacervate is exchanged back during its dissolution. The underlying Gaussian function is defined with the help of three adjustable parameters. nc, a and DHc. nc corresponds to the polyelectrolyte composition displaying the highest coacervate content. a is proportional to the Full Width at Half Height of the Gaussian curve (FWHH  1.7 a), and DHc is a normalization factor, proportional to the height of the Gaussian curve. Similarly to DHIP, DHc translates a quantity of matter involved in the complexation into an enthalpy per mole of injected acid group. Its value is a characteristic of a given polyanion/polycation system. Nevertheless, when comparing values of DHc from the same system in different conditions it can be used as a way to compare the amount of polymer present in coacervate phase. These three parameters (nc, a and DHc) have clearly defined impacts on the resulting isotherm DQc. As the result of a numerical derivation of a gaussian function, DQc crosses the x-axis in a steep slope. The corresponding polymer composition is given by the value of nc. It is the composition at which the most complex coacervate is observed, and is given in Table 2 in terms of mol% of acid groups for straightforward comparison with turbidity and rheology results. DHc is a proportionality factor. The amplitudes of both positive and negative extrema of DQc are proportional to its value. These amplitudes are also affected by a. However, a most obviously controls the width of the polyelectrolyte composition range showing high coacervate contents. The x-axis distance between the ex
trema of DQc is equal to ap2 (100 to match the x-axis units of Fig. 7B and 8). Fig. 8 presents experimental binding isotherms (squares) of PEI complexing with PGlu and the result of the respective regressions with respect to the proposed model (solid lines) while Table 2 displays the corresponding values of the six adjustable parameters introduced above. The total Gibbs free energy change DGIP of the ion pair binding process and its entropic term TDSIP are deduced from Ka and DHIP. An interesting conclusion is that both stages of the complexation processes, in all the conditions tested, are endothermic. We re

ported a similar conclusion for a set of other polycation/polyanion systems in different conditions analyzed with the use of the same model [34]. The ion pair binding of polyhystidine with poly(D,Lglutamic acid) was found to be exothermic, and was the only exception. In particular, we have found no example of an exothermic coacervate formation, suggesting that not only this process is entropy-driven (from the release of counter-ions), but also that this phase separation is enthalpically unfavored in all cases. In turn, this also means that the dissolution of coacervate with a change in polymer concentrations is an exothermic process in all cases studied. This is consistent with other work, though comparatively little work has been done on well-characterized synthetic polymer systems [53]. The values of DHc show good agreement with the trends observed in turbidity for equivalent experiments. A higher total polymer concentration means more coacervate formed, although less than proportionality would suggest. Taking into account the normalization by the injected amount of the values presented in Table 2, a 10 fold increase in polymer concentration results in an increase of the heat change associated with coacervate formation by a factor of about 7. Changes in the chain lengths, at equivalent acid group concentration, impact only slightly the values of DHc, especially compared to the corresponding changes in turbidity (see Fig. 3B). The trend is similar, with molecular weights of 2, 10 and 60 kDa yielding to increasing values of DHc: 0.61, 0.64 and 0.70 kJ/mol, respectively. The difference between the corresponding values of turbidity is significantly higher but since neither DHc nor turbidity is expected to have a linear relationship with the amount of coacervate phase formed, this quantitative discrepancy is not surprising. Finally, DHc in the absence of supporting salt is much lower than in presence of salt (0.24 versus 0.64 kJ/mol, without salt and with 200 mM NaCl respectively). This is in accordance with turbidity results (see Fig. 3A, red line), pointing to very limited complex coacervation in the absence of salt. It is of importance to note that the values of the stoichiometric numbers n and nc are largely below 1. These values represent ratios
of total molar concentrations in ionizable groups for each polymer. In the case of hyperbranched PEI, this means that the base groups as we define them here are not all identical; they include primary, secondary and tertiary amino groups. As mentioned earlier, these different groups have very different dissociation coefficients at pH 7.0, explaining a stoichiometry at maximum coacervate formation closer to 1:2 than to 1:1 (PEI:PGlu), or in terms of ratio nc, closer to 0.5 than to 1. Additionally, values of the ion pair binding stoichiometry number, n, are much lower. This could be explained by the fact that primary, secondary and tertiary amines display different binding affinities with carboxylate groups. Values of n would be even lower than those of nc in that case, as they are indeed observed, since only a fraction of the base groups that are charged would participate in the binding process. The fact that the highest observed value of n (0.35 while other conditions yield values between 0.12 and 0.20) is observed in absence of salt further supports this hypothesis: with then strengthened electrostatic interactions, the affinity of all amino groups to ion pair binding should be expected to rise. The findings on the thermodynamic characteristics of the interactions between the two polyelectrolytes described above can be related with studies performed with other systems. One example is the interactions between polyelectrolytes and surfactants [2933]. These interactions are also endothermic indicating a coassembly mechanism dominated by the entropy changes, likely due to the released counter-ions. Furthermore, in many of these cases the complexation appears to proceed in two steps as we describe here. Despite the similar features observed in the two types of complexation, generalization is not an easy task. The reason for that are the significant differences in the second step of the complexation. In the case of the polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexation the second step is related with phenomena such as micellization [31] or precipitate formation [33], which can not easily be related with the coacervate formation seen here.
3.7. Composition of complex coacervates
The composition of the complex coacervate phase (i.e. water content) is of significant importance as it can affect the properties of the material. Experimentally, the water content is determined by weighing the coacervates before and after drying. For all the systems reported here the water content is between 65 and 82 wt% (Table 3) depending on the conditions used. This observation is consistent with earlier reports on the composition of coacervates formed from polyelectrolytes [26], biomacromolecules [36] or combinations of both [20]. It is interesting to note that complex coacervates prepared from polypeptides have exhibited a much smaller variation in the water content within these limits (71–82 wt%) [26]. However, coacervates prepared from biomacromolecules such as b-lactoglobulin/pectin have exhibited a similar variation as seen here (65–90 wt%) [36]. This observation shows

that coacervate composition is related with the structure of the polyelectrolytes, with the coacervates prepared from polymers with complex architecture (e.g. branched polymers, biopolymers) having a larger variation in composition. Changes in the ionic strength of the mixtures (salt concentration) or the acid:base ratio have an effect on the composition of the coacervates. As seen in Table 3, the water content of the coacervate phase increases up to 16 wt% when increasing the salt concentration of the mixtures (from 100 to 1000 mM) or up to 11 wt% when changing the acid:base ratio (from 31:69 to 17:83 mol% acid:base ratio). Due to the increased screening effect, the ability of the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to form complexes though electrostatic interactions is weakened when the salt concentration in the mixture increases (see Section 3.3). This has as a result an increase in the polymer concentration of the equilibrium solution at the expense of the polymer concentration in the coacervate phase. Therefore, coacervates with less interacting polymer chains and higher water content are formed, as the salt concentration is increrased. This finding is in agreement with the theoretical predictions of Spruijt et al. on the effect of salt on the composition of PDMEMA/PAA coacervates [21]. A change in the density of polyanion/polycation chain network (coacervate) is also seen when different acid:base ratios are used. Coacervates formed using 31:69 wt% acid:base ratio have the lower water content (Table 3). As discussed earlier, under these conditions the number of charged groups is maximum and more polymer chains can be involved in the complexation. Therefore, a highly interconected polymer network (coacervate) with lower water content is created. When the ratio changes, less chains are available to interact forming a less dense network with higher water content. The effect of polyelectrolyte ratio on the compossition of coacervates has also been reported for coacervates formed from b-lactoglobulin/pectin [36] or combinations of polypeptides [26].
3.8. Rheological properties of complex coacervates
Rheological measurements were employed to investigate how changes in the salt concentration of the mixtures or the acid:base ratio (which causes a change in water content) influence the mechanical properties of the coacervates. The viscosity of PEI/PGlu and PEI/PAsp coacervates is determined by carrying out steady shear experiments of samples prepared with different salt concentrations or acid:base ratios. A decrease in viscosity was observed as the acid:base ratio changed from 31:69 to 17:83 mol% (Fig. 9A), following the change in water content presented in Table 3. The highest viscosity was seen for the sample prepared with a 31:69 mol% acid:base ratio where the stronger intermolecular electrostatic interactions and the lower water content were observed, as discribed earlier. The viscosity of the coacervates also changes as the salt concentration used to prepare the mixtures is varied. From Fig. 9B a decrease in the viscosity of the coacervates is seen as the salt concentration in the mixtures is increasing. The increasing screeing effect of the salt on the charges leads to coacervates with weaker intermolecular electrostatic interactions, higher water content and therefore lower viscosities. The influence of the electrostatic interactions

on the viscosity of coacervates seen here is consistend with earlier observations on protein/gum Arabic coacervates [53]. In Fig. 10 the dynamic moduli G0 and G00 are presented as a function of frequency for PEI/PAsp coacervates formed with various salt concentrations. The experiments were performed at a constant strain of 1%, which was found to be in the linear regime. All of the coacervates exhibit a viscoelastic behavior, which is in line with results on complexes of oppositely charged biological [54] or synthetic macromolecules [37] and other soft materials [55]. The viscoelastic behavior is strongly dependant on the salt concentration (Fig. 10). For the coacervate formed with the lower salt concentration (Fig. 10A) the loss (viscous) modulus (G00) has higher values compared to the storage (elastic) modulus (G0), for almost all frequencies tested. As the salt concentration is increased the loss modulus values are decreasing until they become lower than the storage modulus values, for almost all frequencies (Fig. 10C). Coacervates prepared with lower salt are more viscous while coacervates prepared with higher salt are more elastic. The shift in the crossover point of G0 and G00 with changing salt concentration, as seen in Fig. 10, points to the change in relaxation time scales of the coacervates. In an analogous fashion to the commonly used time–temperature superposition, Spruijt et al. [37]
suggested that the frequency dependent modulus change of coacervates can be rescaled to create a master curve spanning many orders of time scale. As shown in Fig. 11A and B, frequency sweep curves were shifted to create master curves that can predict behavior at a wide range of time scales not accessible by conventional rheological measurements. Fig. 11C compares the shift factor used for each curve to the salt present and shows that both the modulus and frequency shift factors depend strongly on salt concentration.
4. Conclusions
A systematic and comprehensive study of complex coacervation phenomenon between PEI and polypeptides PGlu or PAsp was presented. Sample turbidity and optical microscopy showed that coacervation between these polymers can be tuned by changes in a series of parameters including but not limited to salt concentration and acid:base ratio, in accordance to earlier coacervate studies [26]. The precipitate-coacervate and coacervate-solution boundaries were identified experimentally through turbidity and microscopy and were used to establish phase change diagrams. These are rare in literature but extremely useful tools for achieving coacervation, since the boundaries are system dependent. The range of acid:base ratio for which a precipitate or coacervate can be formed is between 15 and 88 mol% (—NHþ
3 groups), significantly broader compared to other systems as PAA/PAH (24–75 mol%) [22]. A comprehensive understanding of the coacervation phenomenon cannot be achieved without understanding the nature of the interactions between the polyelectrolytes and the thermodynamic mechanisms involved in the complexation. Microcalorimetry experiments demonstrated that complex coacervation is entropydriven (from the release of counter-ions) and enthalpically unfavored process. Increasing the molecular weight and total polymer concentrations of the mixtures increases the entropy gains of the complexation. Finally, we showed that composition and the rheological properties (e.g. viscosity, viscoelasticity) of complex coacervates can be tuned by changes in salt concentration and acid:base ratio. Information on the composition and the properties of the coacervates is very useful for identifying and exploring the potentials of these materials towards specific applications (e.g. encapsulation). In an analogous fashion to time–temperature superposition [37], master curves that can predict rheological behavior at a wide range of time scales, not accessible by conventional rheological measurements, were created. To the best our knowledge, this is the first time that such curves are reported. The combination of the experimental techniques used here allowed for the understanding of all important aspects of coacervation between PEI and polypeptides. These insights can be used to determine potential applicability of these systems in numerous applications in a variety of fields.
