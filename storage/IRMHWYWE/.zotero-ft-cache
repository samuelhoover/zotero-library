Driving Forces for Oppositely-Charged Polyion Association in Aqueous Solutions:
Enthalpic, Entropic, but not Electrostatic

Abstract
Driving forces for association between oppositely-charged biological or synthetic polymers in aqueous solution have long been identified as electrostatic in origin. This attraction is broken down into an entropic component, due to loss of counterions, and an enthalpic component, stemming from Coulombic attraction between opposite charges. While the balance between entropic and enthalpic contributions shifts according to the conditions, the presence of exotherms or endotherms on mixing, though small, are viewed as signatures of Coulombic interactions which support theories of polyelectrolyte association rooted in continuum electrostatics. Here, a head-to-head comparison is made between mechanisms based on electrostatics and those based on specific ion pairing, or ion exchange. Using a Hofmeister series of counterions for a common polycation, poly(diallyldimethylammonium), enthalpy changes on association with poly(styrene sulfonate) are shown to derive from changes in water perturbation, revealed by Raman scattering studies of water O-H vibrations. The free energy for complexation is almost completely entropic over all salt concentrations.

Introduction
Interactions between oppositely-charged units on macromolecules assist in the formation of numerous condensed phases. In natural systems these interactions play a role in protein folding and molecular recognition.

Synthetic polyelectrolytes associate to yield dense polyelectrolyte complexes,

PECs, or more liquid-like coacervates.

Because most synthetic polyelectrolytes lack specific recognition elements, such as hydrogen-bonding, the driving force for association between polycation, Pol

, and polyanion, Pol

, repeat units appears to be the straightforward electrostatic attraction of opposite charges, represented by

Quantitative understanding of the electrostatic mechanism is immediately fraught with difficulty which stems from an incomplete theoretical description of the interactions within the starting materials themselves: the polyelectrolytes.
4
A closer look at the issues plaguing polyelectrolyte theory reveals that the culprits of confusion usually turn out to be the counterions and their exact location. For example, should each charged polymer repeat unit be accompanied by a counteranion A

or cation M
+
as depicted in Equation 1, or should only the fraction of ions ìcondensedî on the polyelectrolyte chain be included?
5
Despite decades of refinements to electrostatic analyses attempting to answer these questions, much experimental data is still not rationalized.
6
The central question for PECs is: how do counterions moderate the electrostatic attraction between Pol
+
and Pol

?
A signature of net electrostatic (Coulombic) attraction would be an exotherm on polyelectrolyte association. Yet, from the early days of studies into polyelectrolyte complexes it was remarked that no heat was generated upon complexation and therefore it must be entropically driven (by the ìescaping tendency of the microionsî as Michaels put it.
2c
) With the advent of more sensitive thermal methods, such as the isothermal calorimeter, small heats of complexation (a few kJ mol
-1
) were measured.
7
We have analyzed associations between polyelectrolytes using a site model where the state of association between polyelectrolytes is controlled only by the chemical potential (concentration) of salt MA.
8
Simple equilibrium expressions are sufficient to fit the data over a wide range. Using this ion exchange/pairing model it was straightforward to explain differences in association for polyelectrolytes bearing different counterions across the Hofmeister series ñ a more hydrated counterion is easier to expel.
8c
Michaels initially used the ion pairing terminology
2b
but a few years later subscribed to the emerging electrostatics vocabulary and concepts,
2d
even though they were unable to explain the strong differences in association due to counterion identity.
Illustrated by the numerous morphologies in which polyelectrolyte complexes are found, association is not an all-or-nothing situation. A PEC in which all the repeat units are paired is rubbery, even glassy, in nature,
2c,9
whereas a PEC with few Pol
+
Pol

pairs yields a diffuse liquidlike material (coacervate). A carefully selected combination of PEC and salt allows access to the whole ìcontinuumî of morphologies simply by changing salt concentration.
10
This degree of association/dissociation controls all the properties of a PEC, such as modulus, ion selectivity, hydration, and permeability. Intramolecular association between opposite charges on the same

DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b11878
chain are also controlled by salt concentration.11 In biomacromolecules, as a protein folds the fraction of charged peptides that pair (form ìsalt bridgesî) may increase.1f
There has recently been renewed interest in simple theories describing polyelectrolyte association. For example, a theory by Overbeek and Voorn12 has been adapted by the Wageningen group13 to describe phase boundaries in PEC formation. Negative enthalpies of complexation, though small, appear to support the role of electrostatics. Endothermic complexation cannot be rationalized by simple analytical theories,12-13 but more recent molecular dynamics simulations14 allow for positive or negative enthalpy changes. Theories relying on electrostatics do not describe the degree of association within a synthetic PEC. We have consistently avoided the use of electrostatic arguments to explain polyelectrolyte complexation and the response of PECs to solution ions. The term ìion pairingî invokes the central concept of a positive and a negative polyelectrolyte repeat unit associating and allows prediction of the strength of interaction using simple arguments based on entropy. At the same time the driving force is still labeled ìelectrostaticî by almost all researchers in the field.
The electrostatic and ion pairing viewpoints are quite divergent, although they both predict weakening interactions with increasing salt concentration. The finding that there are enthalpic components to complexation continues to provide support, even if tentative, for the electrostatics picture of PEC formation. The purpose of the present work is to show what physically could be responsible, if not Coulombic interactions, for enthalpic changes when polyelectrolytes pair. In doing so, we provide a head-to-head comparison of electrostatics and ion pairing arguments, exploiting the Hofmeister series to emphasize the conclusion that the driving force does not derive from continuum electrostatics, as has been argued for at least 50 years.
Results and Discussion
Enthalpies of complexation or association are obtained from calorimetric studies. Isothermal calorimetry (ITC), more familiar to biochemists measuring interactions between small molecules and proteins, has occasionally been employed to study complexation between synthetic polyelectrolytes7a-f,7h-j and between polyelectrolytes and ions.15 These calorimetric studies have highlighted the major role of entropic driving forces for association in the presence of small enthalpic contributions. In ITC small aliquots of one component are added to a larger volume of a second component and the heat (endothermic or exothermic) is recorded during each addition. An example is seen in Figure 1A where 10 mM poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), PDADMAC, is added to 0.5 mM poly(styrene sulfonate, sodium salt), PSSNa, in the cell (this combination of polyelectrolytes has been used extensively in the field). Exothermic spikes are translated to 〉H in Figure 1B as a function of the molar ratio, r, of positive to negative charged repeat units mixed. Small background signals from heats of PDAMDAC dilution and
instrumental nonidealities, seen at r > 1, may be subtracted. These amount to less than 100 J mol
1.15
For interactions of a small ligand with a (bio)macromolecule, interpretation of ITC results as in Figure 1B is usually done by assuming the ligand has one or two binding sites. The 〉H vs. r is fit with a curve using a binding constant Ka which then yields the free energy change

interactions between polyelectrolytes make the 1- or 2-site binding model inapplicable and complicate the fitting considerably. Various models have been used to analyze ITC data of polyelectrolyte complexation resulting in widely varying association constants Ka. It is difficult to establish whether these variations are due to differences in the model or in the materials (polyelectrolytes) and conditions. Some examples are as follows (Ka in parentheses):
polyamidoamine/DNA (105);16 polyallylamine/PSS (105 - 107);7d chitosan/DNA (109 ñ 1010);7f PDADMAC/DNA (105 - 106);7g polypeptides (104 - 105);7h PDADMAC/poly(acrylic acid) (103 105).7j In the present work, no curve fitting was performed on ITC data. The total heat evolved was simply integrated and the background subtracted; i.e. the areas under each spike were summed. This sum is the enthalpy of complexation under the conditions (salt concentration) employed. The assumption that all polyelectrolyte is complexed at r = 1 is justified by the fact that no free polyelectrolyte is found at this point for any concentration of polymers mixed.
Ideally, heat is evolved on complexation until the ratio is 1.0. Figure 1 illustrates this expected output for a 1:1 complex of PSS and PDADMA. To obtain reliable thermodynamic data from ITC one must be confident that the system is not biased or compromised by kinetics. Polyelectrolyte complexes and compositions are often found to be kinetically trapped.4 Early examples of polyelectrolyte combinations which exhibited labile or nonlabile association were presented in the pioneering work of the Moscow State group.17 In another manifestation of kinetic control, the composition of PECs is notoriously dependent on mixing order.18 The addition of salt is known to ìunfreezeî PECs, allowing the chains to reconfigure and compact.19
Experimentally, there are two ways to ensure ITC interpretations of polyelectrolyte associations are not compromised by kinetics. First, for strong binding of polymer to polymer, heat evolution should stop at r = 1.0, which suggests all the cationic repeat units have complexed with all the anionic ones. Second, the total heat evolved at r = 1.0 should not depend on the mixing order (whether Pol+ is added to Pol- or vice versa). A ìreverse titrationî was implemented by titrating PSS(Na) into PDADMA(Cl) in 0.1 M NaCl (Figure S1). The enthalpy of this reversed titration was -1.91 kJ mol-1, which is close to the enthalpy (-1.88 kJ mol-1) from the PDADMACPSS titration in Figure 1.

The total enthalpy of reaction is obtained by summing heat from each injected aliquot until the background is reached (r ≈ 1) and subtracting the background due to the enthalpy of PDADMA(X) dilution seen at r >1.
Salt Concentration Dependence of ǻH
Response to ionic strength (salt concentration) is a well-known and central property of polyelectrolyte solutions: coil size generally decreases as salt is added.4,20 In polyelectrolyte complexation, salt counterions moderate the interaction between oppositely charged segments. The enthalpy of complexation, 〉HPEC, between PDADMA and PSS was measured over the range [NaCl] = 0 to 2.0 M. No models were used to fit the binding. The total heat generated to complex an aliquot of PSS (PDADMA) in the cell was integrated to the point where no more heat above background was seen (close to r = 1). As seen in Figure 2 〉HPEC becomes less exothermic when the components are mixed in solutions of higher ionic strength. Increasing salt concentrations, converted to activities using tabulated activity coefficients, gave a broad span of 〉HPEC between

Models for Association
Two concepts will be compared to analyze the driving force for polyelectrolyte association. In the electrostatics model, electric fields driving attraction (between opposite charges) or repulsion (between like charges) compete with entropy loss of ions condensing on polyelectrolytes. The range of electric fields is set by the solvent dielectric constant and the ionic strength of the solution (ìscreeningî). In the ion pairing model, interactions are controlled by the activities (concentrations) of the species competing amongst each other to form the following electrically neutral ion pairs: Pol-Pol+, Pol-M+, Pol+A-. Both of these models account for some observations, such as the dependence of interaction strength on salt concentration, but different vocabularies and concepts are used. The importance of counterion entropy is central to both models: it is known that polyelectrolytes lose their counterions, a driving force for association, when they complex. For example, analysis of bulk complexes2b,c or neutron scattering of solution macromolecules21 shows loss of counterions.
Electrostatic Model
In a continuum electrostatics model charged polyelectrolytes in solution collect an atmosphere of ions around themselves (see Scheme 1 on the left). An energy gain 〉Hatm by bringing oppositely-charged ions close to the polymer counters a loss in entropy by taking them

out of bulk solution and forcing them to reside next to the chain. Polyelectrolytes are now set up for complexation.
On complex formation, counterions are lost (costing ñ 〉Hatm), and polyelectrolytes are paired (gaining 〉Hpair). The net enthalpy is 〉HPEC. Estimates are available for the Coulombic
energy, i.e. the origin of 〉Hatm, for ìdressingî a polyelectrolyte chain with counterions.5b The association of ìbareî polyelectrolytes (in water) is less studied using electrostatic models. The decrease of exothermicity seen in Figure 2 is explained by screening of the oppositely-charged polymer repeat units by counterions, thereby reducing the electrostatic (Coulombic) attractions.
Scheme 1. Electrostatic picture of polyelectrolyte complexation. Polymers lose their condensed atmosphere of ions (dotted lines) on association. Enthalpy, 〉Hatm, and entropy changes in ìdressingî polyelectrolytes with counterions have been treated extensively by theory.5b
In an effort to bypass the complexity (or lack) of analytical solutions, molecular dynamics methods have been pressed into service recently.14,22 These sophisticated models still rely on the concepts from continuum electrostatics (interactions via Coulombís law, uniform dielectric constant of medium, counterion is a sphere with a point charge, Bjerrum length, counterion condensation, Debye screening length) but allow the system to find its minimum energy in silico. Three pairwise interactions are pitted against each other in defining the net Coulomb energy of the system: polyion-polyion, polyion-counterion, and counterion-counterion, with attraction between opposites and repulsion between like charges.
Ou and Muthukumar,14 OM, show the electrostatic energy (Coulomb energy), the source of 〉HPEC, is a weak function of salt concentration for strongly charged polyelectrolytes (like DNA). As with many simulations, scaling predictions are made rather than absolute values, with arbitrary units for 〉H. The parameter of interest is the Coulomb strength parameter, ī, which is the ratio of the Bjerrum length, lb (about 0.7 nm in water at 25 oC) to the charge separation

Although OM account for both endothermic and exothermic complexation enthalpies, as can be seen in Figure 3 the scaling of predicted 〉HPEC deviates strongly from experimental.

Elder et al.22 studied the binding of polylysine to DNA with molecular dynamics simulations and predicted a 〉HPEC of about -43 kJ mol-1 with a T〉S of about -14 kJ mol-1 (i.e.
the association is entropically disfavored), whereas Ikonen et al.23 measured 〉HPEC to be much smaller: -3 kJ for association of DNA with polyethyleneimine and smaller than +/- 1 kJ for complexation with polylysine, which implies an entropically-driven process.
In these examples the electrostatic model clearly does not correlate with experimental data. The failures of the electrostatic model continue with an inability to account for the strong dependence of polymer/polymer interactions on the type of ion, described further below. In addition, polyelectrolytes with identical values of ī, such as polyacrylic acid and polyallylamine, have strongly different binding energies with oppositely-charged polymers.24 Of course, one could account for ìspecificî interactions with an additional interaction parameter but that would admit the insufficiency of the electrostatic description.
Ion Pairing Model
Ion pairing is a highly localized (within a couple of solvent molecules) phenomenon with chemical specificity. When competition is between different ions for the same site it is

DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b11878
equivalent to ion exchange.25 In dilute salt polyelectrolytes pair when mixed as in Equation 1. The stepwise association of Pol+ and Pol- is illustrated by Scheme 2.
Scheme 2. Complexation of an equimolar mixture of PDADMAC and PSS. The system starts on the left with isolated chains and a doping level of 1.0 (fully ìextrinsicî charge compensation). As salt ions are progressively removed more ion pairs are formed until, at [NaCl] = 0, the complex is fully paired (intrinsic compensation).
The representation of complex formation in Scheme 2 is simplified for the sake of clarity. In reality, the pairing is more random, with a mixture of ladder-like (between adjacent repeat units) and network-like (between repeat units on different chains or remote units on the same chain) contacts.9 Polymer chains adopt compact, random coil conformations26 in this amorphous ìscrambled saltî composition.2b
With the addition of salt to solution it is possible to reverse complexation, and, if the association is not too strong, return polyelectrolyte chains to their fully separated, individual state. Between these extremes is a range of ion pairings defined by a ìdoping level,î y, which is the fraction of ion pairs in the counterion-compensated (ìextrinsicî) form. The doping level controls all physical properties of PECs in their bulk or thin-film form. For example, when y  1 the PEC is highly swollen, loosely associated, behaves like an elastic liquid and is termed a ìcoacervate.î3c However, our discussion here is focused on the more highly-paired form of a PEC, where y  0, and where the PEC has a more ìcheese-likeî bulk morphology.
Under the right conditions, for most PECs, polycations pair with all the polyanion repeat units when the two are mixed and the stoichiometry approaches 1:1. Off-stoichiometric compositions result when the PEC ion pairs are too strong and the salt concentration is too low.17b Our extensive experience with PSS and PDADMA has shown us they complex with 1:1 stoichiometry if their concentration is not too high.27 Once formed, the ion content within a PEC is rapidly reversible (perhaps diffusion limited28).
If the doping level is under equilibrium control it should be possible to define an equilibrium constant that connects y to various salt concentrations. While the concentration of salt MA is easily translated to activity, the question of polymer ìconcentrationî must be addressed with more care. Solution concentrations of synthetic polymers are provided in terms of the repeat unit because there is no unique molecular weight for chains, even for samples with narrow polydipersities. The use of monomer concentration, which does not account for connectivity within a polymer chain, is a classical conundrum, recognized at the outset by Flory and others as a failure of the ìmean fieldî approximation for dilute polymer solutions.29 In PEC

formation, as soon as the first ion pair is made between polyelectrolytes (ìfirst contactî) they have lost the small amount of solution translational entropy they had. At this point, the PEC is considered a separate phase and its composition is described by the degree of ion pairing, with y = 0 as the reference phase for fully paired PEC. Such a description of the state of a PEC is almost fully complete because of the long-chain nature of polymers. For example, when describing the state of association of a polyelectrolyte with 1000 repeat units, for over 99.9% of the possible interactions (y = 0 to 0.999) it is already bound to another polymer. To represent the states of association, Equation 1 is modified slightly

Strong association of the polymer i.e. association of the entire polymer chain over all conditions is not a sign of thermodynamic irreversibility. Ion pairs must be reversible on the time scale of the experiment so that the thermodynamically proscribed degree of segmental association (ie. Equation 4) may be achieved.
Response of 〉HPEC to a Hofmeister Series of Counterions
The counterion has a strong influence on PEC association. For example, along the series F-, CH3COO- (Ac-), ClO3-, Cl-, NO3-, Br-, I-, ClO4-, SCN-, known as a Hofmeister series, Ka
varied from 125 to 0.3.28 The physical significance of the Hofmeister series,30 exhibited for anions more strongly than cations,31 and its impact on a wide variety of small ion/molecule and macromolecular behaviors was, for a long time, associated with ìbreakingî and ìmakingî (right to left in the F-  SCN- series above) water structure by ìchaotropicî to ìkosmotropicî ions, respectively.32 This interpretation has been vigorously debated for decades.33 That water structure is perturbed is generally accepted,34 but the range of this effect may be limited,35 probably to the first hydration shell.36 The water content of PECs is low enough for most water molecules to be within a hydration-shell distance of the Pol+Pol- ion pair.
Ranking of a selection of ions in a Hofmeister series (there is no unique ranking since differences are observed depending on the technique37) also reveals a parallel trend in the numbers of waters of hydration: ions labeled as more chaotropic are also less hydrated (in general).38 The number of water molecules per ion (hydration number),8c,39 has been used to quantitatively rationalize differences in doping by different ions in PSS/PDADMA(X).8c,28 Differences in hydrophobicity also apply to polyelectrolyte repeat units. For example, carboxylate is more hydrated than sulfonate so the former would complex more weakly with a quaternary ammonium like PDADMA.8c
Here, samples of PDADMA(X) with different counterions, X-, were prepared by dialyzing PDADMA(Cl) against various sodium salts NaX (X = Br-, Cl-, NO3-, ClO3-, CH3COO-,
F-). Quantitative replacement of Cl- by X- was verified by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (see Supporting Information Figure S2). PDADMA(X) in a solution of 0.1 M NaX was titrated into PSS(Na) in 0.1 M NaX (the same conditions as in Figure 1). Raw ITC curves (Figures S3-S7) for the six PDADMA(X) Hofmeister series anions showed uncomplicated exothermic behavior except for Br-. Any nonidealities in complexation would be expected to show up at the smallest heats generated. For PDADMA(Br) complexation individual aliquots of titrant generated less heat at first. The larger heat output towards the end of the titration (Figure S3), together with small endotherms, are probably signs of compaction of complex.40 Again, no modeling of titration curves was performed: the heat output was simply integrated until the reaction was complete (at r = 1, whereupon background only remains).

[MA]  0. The stoichiometry is close to 1.0 with the exception of acetate ion, believed to be caused by the difficulty in drying PDADMA(Ac) completely. Because more hydrophobic ions I-, ClO4-, and SCN- precipitated PDADMA (in line with Hofmeisterís original experiments on
proteins30) a more hydrophobic cation, K+, was substituted for Na+ in an effort to approach 〉HPEC = 0 (see Figure S8). As seen in Table 1 this substitution did, indeed, bring the system to almost athermal mixing.

Qualitative Study of Water Perturbation by FTIR
Water hydrogen bonding stores a great deal of cohesive energy.41 Thus, even small perturbations of the H-bonding network should translate to measurable enthalpic changes. The impact of a point dipole on the surrounding water may be observed spectroscopically from changes in the O-H vibrational spectra (3000 - 3500 cm-1).36b,42 First, for a qualitative idea of the differences of water structure between bulk and within a PEC, a piece of fully hydrated (by soaking in water) ion-free PDADMA/PSS PEC was pressed against a diamond internal reflectance assembly (ATR) and the ATR-IR spectrum recorded as shown in Figure 5 (with three bands from the C-H stretching of the polymer at 2884-2977 cm-1 subtracted). The O-H stretching envelope includes an asymmetric mode at 3550 cm-1, a mode at 3396 cm-1 assigned to a disordered tetrahedral hydrogen-bonding network, and a symmetric stretch at 3250 cm-1 also assigned to the H-bonding network.43

Figure 5. ATR-FTIR spectra of O-H stretching regions from water in bulk water (red, solid line), PDADMA/PSS complex saturated with water (green, dash-dot line); and difference spectrum (blue dotted line). C-H stretching features at ca. 2900 cm-1 have been subtracted using dry complex. Arrows indicate the location of bands assigned to an O-H symmetric stretch (3550 cm-1, A); disordered tetrahedral hydrogen bonding network (3396 cm-1, B); symmetric H-bonding network (3250 cm-1, C).
The final state of PEC at [MA] 0 is the same for all complexation reactions with different PDADMA(X). The initial state differs by the identity of the PDADMA counterion. Thus, the next step of the qualitative comparison was to compare IR spectra of solutions of PDADMA(X). This study was performed by placing a drop of 1.0 M PDADMA(X) on the ATR crystal and allowing the water to partially evaporate. The water content was referenced to a 1.0 M solution of PDADMA(X) to obtain the ratio of water molecules to PDADMA repeat units. A comparison of the O-H stretching band for a water:PDADMA molar ratio of 5:1, with the C-H stretching features (mostly) subtracted is shown in Figure 6. Inasmuch as the shifts and intensity changes indicate changes in water structure, the qualitative trend in structure perturbation is clear and approximately tracks the trend in 〉HPEC seen in Table 1. Figure S9 presents additional FTIR data.

Quantitative Study of Water Perturbation by Raman spectroscopy
The IR results in Figures 5 and 6 support an apparent structural change of water as the possible cause of 〉H

. Raman spectroscopy afforded a more quantitative estimate of the degree of water disruption, which indicates anions to be more effective than cations in this respect.

to look at perturbations of water by LiCl,
45
and later extended by Kitano et al. to polymers in solution,

including polyelectrolytes

The analysis focuses on the highly polarized O-H band at around 3250 cm

assigned to the collective in-phase symmetric O-H stretch of strongly Hbonded water. Changes of the band intensity have been assumed to reflect perturbations (reinforcements or disruptions) of water H-bonding.

While N
corr
is a specific value, the nature of these ìdefectsî is not clear: how seriously is the structure of water perturbed by such a defect? A defect cannot be the complete loss of an H-bond according to the 2-state model (ìintactî or ìbrokenî) of Muller

The comparison of the difference in water perturbation versus the enthalpy of complexation in Figure 8 follows some fascinating trends: first, ǻNcorr tracks 〉HPEC well; second,
as ǻNcorr  0, 〉HPEC  0, which is expected if 〉HPEC is a direct (and proportional, it seems) result of changes in water structure/perturbation. The physical reasons for the magnitude of ǻNcorr along a Hofmeister series are not understood at present, although they may stem from the
increasing mismatch in size (and polarizability) between ion and PDADMA going from Br- to F-. Nevertheless, it is clear that the right anion, whether it exists or not, would generate zero enthalpy of association between polyelectrolytes. Unfortunately, ions more chaotropic than Br-, such as I-, ClO4- and SCN-, precipitated PDADMA and could not be used.
Figure 8. Relationship between PDADMA(X)-PSS(Na) complexation enthalpy 〉HPEC as
[MA]0 from Table 1 and ǻNcorr, a measure of the differences between relative extent of water structure perturbation between the counterion residing on PDADMA and free in solution.
It is known that breaking water hydrogen bonds increases entropy and is endothermic. The enthalpy to break a hydrogen bond, 〉HHB, at room temperature is about 8 kJ and T〉SHB is
about 6 kJ.53 Under these opposing forces, the net 〉G of an H-bond approaches a small number (here, 2 kJ). This is an example of the well-known and much debated concept of enthalpyentropy compensation.54 If ǻNcorr were the number of H-bonds broken/made per polymer repeat
unit, the slope of Figure 8 would indicate 0.5 kJ of 〉H per H-bond, which is much less53 than the estimated 8 kJ. This mismatch is another clue that hydrogen bonds are not formally broken by ions.
The possibility that different ions ìcondenseî or associate more strongly on polyelectrolytes (known as ìregularizationî55) was discounted by measuring the electrical conductivities of all PDADMA(X) solutions (see Figure S11) and extrapolating to infinite dilution ȁ∞. For all but Ac-, PDADMA(X) conductivity ȁ∞ was 68±4 % of that of the pure anion (see Table S2), suggesting no trends in ion association. The abnormal high conductivity of PDADMA(Ac) could be the result of the hydrolysis of acetate anion, as the equivalent molar conductivity of OH- is much higher (198.3) than that of Ac-.

Enthalpic and Entropic Driving Forces as a Function of Salt Concentration
The driving force for a particular set of conditions depends on how far away these conditions are from equilibrium. It is not given, as many cartoons depict, by taking a pair of bare polyelectrolytes separated in a medium of fixed dielectric by an infinite distance and bringing them together.

Conclusions

DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b11878
Over the range 0.1 M to 2 M NaCl the driving force for complex formation between PSS and PDADMAC is between 90% and 100% entropic. Small enthalpic contributions to 〉GPEC are ascribable to water perturbation by point source electric fields of counterions rather than Coulombic interactions between charged species. The strength of interaction between Pol+ and Pol- is correlated with, but not caused by, differences in 〉HPEC since the ìdriving forceî is related to the release of water molecules along with polymer counterions. For example, a small counterion like F- is highly hydrated and provides a strong gain in entropy when released, but when it is released its low polarizability and small size perturb the O-H bonds of any additional water that directly surrounds it. Thus, correlations between 〉HPEC and the strength of
complexation are observed7b.
Continuum electrostatics models are not appropriate for highly condensed systems, where the local (within a distance of two or three water molecules) charge density from polyelectrolyte repeat units greatly exceeds that from any salt ions in the vicinity. For example, if the average distance between repeat units, either of the same charge (Pol-/Pol-) or opposite charge (Pol-/Pol+), is on the order of a Bjerrum length it would require at least 2 M of salt to have, on average, at least one salt ion between the charges. At lower concentrations it is difficult to see how salt modifies electric fields. Put another way: the assumption that interactions can be described by these electric fields fails when it is needed the most - when the charges approach each other closely. At the shortest ranges the ìchemicalî aspects of charges, for example how hydrated they are, take over from longer range interactions modeled by extensions of vacuum electrostatics. Only the logic of the entropic component of electrostatic theories survives this scrutiny. The conclusions above are not affected by the controversy over whether and how much water structure ìbreakingî or ìmakingî occurs in a Hofmeister series. Again, ion hydration numbers and observations of supposed structural impacts parallel each other.
Experimental
Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC, molar mass = 400,000 - 500,000
g mol−1 ), poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS, molar mass = 7.5 ◊ 104 g mol−1 ), potassium bromide (KBr), sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium bromide (NaBr) were from Sigma-Aldrich; sodium chlorate (NaClO3), sodium acetate (NaCH3COO) from Mallinckrodt; sodium nitrate (NaNO3), sodium fluoride (NaF) from Fisher Scientific.
Six PDADMA(X) samples with different anions (X = Br-, Cl-, NO3-, ClO3-, CH3COO3-,
F-) were prepared by dialysis followed by lyophilization. 15 mL of PDADMA(Cl-) solution was transferred to a 15 cm dialysis tube (3,500 MW, Thermo Scientific). This PDADMA was dialyzed sequentially against three batches of 1 L 0.1 M NaX for 24 h for each batch. This was followed by 3 days of dialysis against de-ionized water, replacing the water every 24 h. After dialysis, PDADMA(X) solution was frozen using dry ice and dried under lyophilization. Dry, purified PDADMA(Cl) and PSS(Na) samples were prepared by dialyzing the PDADMA(Cl) or PSS(Na) solution from Aldrich against water for 3 days followed lyophilization.
An Epsilon 3 (Panalytical) energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer was used to compare the amounts of Cl and Br in PDADMA(X) samples after dialysis. 0.5 g of dry PDADMA(X) powders was well spread on the bottom of the sample holder. Samples were measured with a Ti

Isothermal calorimetry was performed with a VP-ITC (MicroCal Inc.). A solution of 300ȝL of reactant, approx. 10 mM PDADMA(X), based on the polyelectrolyte repeat unit, in 0.1 M NaX in a rotating (310 rpm) syringe was injected into a sample cell with a volume of 1.4545 mL filled with a solution of PSS(Na) (approx. 0.5mM) in 0.1M NaX in sequential 6 μl aliquots at a rate of 1 aliquots every 4 min. The heat flow was recorded as a function of time. All solutions were degassed at 18 ∞C for 5 minutes prior to each trial. All heats of complexation measurement were recorded at 25.0 ∞C.
Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared (ATR-IR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Alpha FTIR spectrometer with a Platinum ATR Quick Snap sampling module (single reflection diamond crystal). Spectra were collected from 400 ñ 4000 cm

at a resolution of 4 cm

. Six PDADMA(X) samples and dialyzed PSS(Na) solutions were prepared at a concentration of 1 M (based on the polyelectrolyte repeat unit). A 5 ȝL droplet of solution was placed on the surface of the ATR crystal and spectra were taken as the water in the droplet evaporated. Measurements were terminated when no change was observed in the two sequential spectra. A 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm piece of dried PDADMA/PSS PEC was soaked in water for 24 h then forced down on the crystal.
Raman spectra from 2500 to 4000 cm

Raman spectra were obtained using a JY Horiba LabRam HR800 micro-Raman spectrograph with a 17 mW 633 nm Melles-Griot HeNe laser (model 25-LHP-925-249) as a light source. After passing through a bandpass filter the beam was coupled into the microscope (Olympus BX30) by total reflection. The beam was directed through the liquid sample using a macro sample cuvette holder using a 75 mm focal length lens and curved back mirror to allow a double pass which also collected the back scattered radiation .Rayleigh scattering was filtered out by a Semrock edge filter with Raman scattering coupled into the 800 mm focal length spectrograph through a confocal hole. A grating (600 lines/mm, 76x76 mm
2
) dispersed the light onto a 1024 ◊ 256 element open CCD detector (Wright, 26 μm square pixels). Macrosample optics coupled the microscope to a thermoelectrically temperature-controlled cuvette holder (Quantum Northwest TLC 50F) to maximize the Raman signal in a transparent sample. Laser power at the sample was 3 mW. Polarization studies were carried out using Glan-Thompson polarizers and a polarization scrambler placed in the scattered light path. Polarization ratios (I

) were calculated from the integrated intensity of the peaks obtained from Raman spectra in which the scattered radiation was collected parallel (I

) to the polarization of the excitation beam.
Conductivities were measured with a calibrated Thermo Scientific Orion 3 star conductivity meter equipped with a water jacketed cell controlled to 25 ± 0.1 ∞C. Various concentrations of PDADMA(X) solutions were added to the cell.
