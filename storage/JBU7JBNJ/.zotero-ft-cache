ABSTRACT: The utilization of chemical sequence control in polymeric materials is key to enabling material design on par with biomacromolecular systems. One important avenue for scalable sequence-controlled polymers leverages the random copolymerization of distinct monomers, with the statistical distribution of the monomeric sequence arising from reaction kinetics following a first-order Markov process. Here we utilize the framework of the random phase approximation (RPA) to develop a theory for the phase behavior of symmetric polyelectrolyte coacervates whose chemical sequences are dictated by simple statistical distributions. We find that a high charge “blockiness” within the random sequences favors the formation of denser and more salt-resistant coacervates while simultaneously increasing the width of the two-phase region. We trace these physical effects to the increased cooperativity of Coulomb interactions that results from increased charge blockiness in oppositely charged polyelectrolytes.
T
he primary sequence of monomers along a heteropolymer
backbone strongly impacts its physical properties.1,2 A striking example of such sequence-dependent effects arises in
nature:3 proteins are heteropolymers consisting of 20 types of distinct amino acid residues. The primary structure of proteins, that is, the linear sequence of monomers, defines their secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and, therefore, their ultimate functionality and biological activity. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) are proteins that lack a unique folding conformation. The primary sequences of IDPs are often polyampholytic, being poor in hydrophobic units and rich in charged residues; the specific charge pattern defines
their phase behavior in aqueous solutions.4 Recently, it was shown that the dependence of the liquid−liquid phase separation (coacervation) region on the primary sequence of IDPs can be successfully considered in the framework of simple theoretical models that treat these macromolecules as
heteropolymers containing just two (cationic and anionic)7 or
three (also neutral)5,6 distinct monomers. This approach was
also applied to block-polyampholytes.8 At fixed total length of the polyampholyte, larger lengths of the oppositely charged blocks were found to enhance the stability of the coacervate
phase.8 Liquid−liquid phase separation in solutions of polyampholytes is also referred to as self-coacervation, and takes its name from the more traditional complex coacervate phases that oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PEs) can form. In both cases, coacervation takes place due to the Coulomb attraction
of oppositely charged units. The control of complex coacervation via tuning of the primary structure of PEs was proposed in refs 9 and 10. In these works, positively charged polypeptides containing neutral glycine and cationic lysine monomers were arranged into alternating blocks of length τ
containing only neutral/charged monomers.9 The length of the blocks τ was varied, while the total length and average composition of these partially charged polycations were fixed. Phase separation in solutions of these polycations and poly(glutamate) polyanions showed that the clustering of charged monomers in the primary sequence of polycations, that is, higher τ values, favored higher density and salt resistance of the resulting complex coacervate phase. Monte
Carlo simulations9,10 combined with a transfer matrix formal
ism informed by these simulations10 were used to interpret the experimental results. However, this study was limited to sequence-monodisperse molecules and is not directly applicable to sequence polydisperse PEs with monomer sequences governed by statistical relations. Another opportunity to synthesize sequence-controlled PEs is provided by the statistical copolymerization of (i) neutral and ionic comonomers or (ii) two types of neutral monomers
and subsequent ionization of one type of monomer.11 These techniques are inexpensive compared to polypeptide synthesis,

and their reaction kinetics have been studied in detail.12,13 The composition of the resulting random polyelectrolytes and the correlations between charged and uncharged units in their primary sequences can be tuned. The resulting PE chains are, however, sequence-polydisperse so that complex coacervation of the random PEs requires separate theoretical considerations. In this work, we develop the theory of complex coacervation of oppositely charged random PEs and reveal the effect of the primary structure of the PEs on their solution phase behavior. The primary structure of random PEs can be treated as a
first-order Markov process.14,15 For polycations, the corresponding transition matrix is given by

Here pij is the conditional probability that a j-type monomer is followed by a monomer of type i in a linear sequence, with i,j = +,0 for polycations. We assume that polycations and polyanions have the same monomer sequence statistics and average contents of charged units, P+ = P− = P. In the matrix P, p++ + p0+ = 1 and p00 + p+0 = 1, owing to the conservation of
probability. The first-order Markov process can, therefore, be specified by two independent parameters: (i) the average fraction of ionic groups in a PE chain, f

which defines the correlations in the linear monomer sequence. At λ = 0, there are no correlations (memory) along the chain relating to the spacing of the charged and neutral units, p++ =
p+0 = f. The case of λ > 0 corresponds to positive correlations
between identical monomers: p++ = f + λ(1 − f) exceeds the average fraction of charged monomers in the chain, p++ > f. Chains with a tendency to alternate between charged and uncharged monomers are characterized by λ < 0. The larger the λ value, the larger the average length of the block of
consecutive charged monomers, ((1 − λ)(1 − f))−1.16 For a given f ≤ 1/2, the range of λ values providing nonnegative values of the probabilities pij is −f/(1 − f) ≤ λ ≤ 1.
Representative PEs with f = 1/2 and different λ values are shown in Figure 1. In this case, λ = −1 corresponds to the
alternating copolymer of ionic and nonionic units. At f < 1/2, a copolymer with a regular equidistant spacing of charges cannot be described as a first-order Markov chain. For instance, at f = 1/3, it should be a second-order Markov process (defined by a 2 × 2 × 2 transition tensor P), because two successive neutral monomers must be followed by a charged monomer to maintain f = 1/3. Hence, chains with low λ values, −1 ≤ λ < −f/(1−f), cannot be interpreted as first-order Markov sequences, but λ still describes the linear correlations. For this reason, we consider the entire λ range, −1 ≤ λ ≤ 1, at any f.
Coulomb correlation attraction between oppositely charged PEs can be computed using the framework of the random
phase approximation (RPA),17−23 which is rigorously accurate
in the limit of weakly charged PEs, f ≪ 1.24,25 The RPA free energy correction due to Coulomb interactions between PEs depends on the structure factors of the charges within the chains, gq++. Therefore, similar to the case of polyampho
lytes,5−8,26 the RPA accounts for the effect of the PE primary structure on Coulomb correlation attractions. To find gq++, it is convenient to introduce the variable θi,
which is equal to 1 for charged units and −1 for neutral units. The ensemble averaged value and the correlation function of θi
are given by14,15

The latter equation shows that, at λ > 0, the correlation length in the linear sequence of monomers is equal to
(−ln λ)−1. All length scales are given in units of the monomer size, a. Since we consider flexible PEs, the statistical segment
length is on the order of a.14,15,27 The total number of monomers in the PEs is denoted by N; if chains are sufficiently
long, N ≫ (−ln λ)−1, their length polydispersity is negligible. The function (1 + θn)/2 is equal to 1 for charged units and 0
for neutral units. In a Θ solvent, chains within the coacervate
adopt Gaussian conformations,25,28 and the ensemble averaged structure factor of charged units can be written as

provides a measure of the blockiness of charged units in the primary structure of the PEs (see also Figure 1). At λ = −1, gq
λ = 0, and the structure factor gq++ = gsqm = 12f 2/q2 corresponds to a PE with charges homogeneously smeared throughout the chain, with effective monomer charges equal to ef. This approximation for the structure factor of charged monomers is generally used in the RPA consideration of PE
complexation.17−20,22,23 It is a reliable approximation for chains with the regular equidistant charge spacing when the adjacent
ionic units are separated by f−1 − 1 uncharged monomers21 (see Supporting Information). In what follows, we compute over the entire range of λ values, −1 ≤ λ ≤ 1, because λ = −1 corresponds to the important theoretical limit of homoge
neously charged PEs.17−20,22,23 According to eq 9, the structure factor gq++ is the sum of the
standard, q-dependent term, gsqm ∼ q−2, which is due to Gaussian conformations of PEs, and a local, q-independent term gq
λ, which accounts for local correlations of charges in the primarily structure of the PEs. In a symmetric coacervate, where both polyanions and polycations contain equal average fractions of ionic monomers ( f+ = f− = f), polyanion and polycation volume fractions are
equal owing to electroneutrality, φ+ = φ− = φ/2. Similarly, identical sequence statistics of charges in polyanions and polycations (λ+ = λ− = λ) leads to gq++ = gq

The negative osmotic pressure is a monotonically decreasing function of λ: increasing blockiness of charges enhances the cooperativity of interactions between oppositely charged monomers and, hence, increases the correlation attraction of PEs.

For sufficiently long chains, the salt-free supernatant phase is highly diluted, so that the equation Πcorr + Πvol = 0 defines the

In Figure 2b, we plot the value of the parameter β, which defines the relative contribution to the correlation attraction of charge sequence inhomogeneities in the charge patterns of the PEs.

Here Πvol was expanded into a series in φ, and w = 1/6 is the
third viral coefficient in the FH lattice model. The scaling law
for β ≪ 1 is well-known25,33,34 and is independent of Λ, while at β ≫ 1 the coacervate density is controlled by the primary structure of the chain. In the latter case, the coacervate density is equal to the density of a neutral polyampholyte chain containing a fraction f of (ideally randomly distributed) ionic
groups each carrying charge ±Z.35,36 These results are
applicable at uf1/2w1/6 ≪ 1 and u2(1 − f)fΛw−1/3 ≪ 1, respectively. Since our consideration is restricted to the case of low density coacervates, φ ≪ 1, the effects of cross-chain ion pairing and dielectric mismatch between the polymer and
solvent were neglected.37−39
The addition of a 1:1 salt screens correlation attractions between the PEs, decreasing the coacervate density and leading to its eventual disintegration (solution becomes uniphase). To plot the solution binodals, one calculates the RPA correlation correction in the presence of salt ions, which are treated as point-like charges interacting solely electrostatically.

corresponding explicit analytical formulas can be found in the Supporting Information. The resulting binodals for the solution at the Θ solvent conditions, χ = 1/2, are shown in Figure 3. Increasing
blockiness of charges in the primary sequence leads to an increase in the critical salt concentration. Enhanced salt resistance of the coacervate is due to higher cooperativity of electrostatic interactions at larger λ values. Almost a 3-fold increase of the critical salt concentration is observed for λ = 0.3 as compared to λ = −1. Our results are in line with earlier findings on the effect of charge pattern on the coacervation of
oppositely charged PEs,9,10 as well as the self-coacervation of
polyampholytes.7,8 The predictions of the RPA for the coacervate density are reliable, as was confirmed by recent field-theoretic simu
lations.8,43 They can, however, be inaccurate in the vicinity of the critical point, where any mean-field theory fails, as well as on the dilute branch of the binodal. To properly describe the supernatant phase, one should explicitly take into account the formation of single neutral globules formed from, for example,
one polyanion and one polycation.23,43 Our analysis is also able to predict the limiting scaling laws for the coacervate density at high salt concentrations, s ≫ 1. In the limit of infinitely long chains, N → ∞, the equations defining chemical and mechanical equilibrium between the coexisting phases can be linearized with respect to the relative asymmetry of salt ions between phases, (cs1 − cs2)/cs1 ≪ 1, see

The former result, valid at low blockiness of charges, is well
known.18,25 The latter formula shows that, at high salt
concentrations, interactions between the patches of charges
become effectively short-range and pairwise additive.35 This coacervate density coincides with that of a neutral polyamoholyte chain with ±Z charge of ionic monomers in salt
solutions.35 The results of eqs 21 and 29 are summarized in a diagram of scaling coacervate regimes shown in Figure 4. Different
regimes describe the cases of low (I, III) and high (II, IV) salt concentrations and low (I, II) and high (III, IV) charge blockiness. The crossovers are given by

Our considerations have been restricted to the case of moderate λ values, when the coacervate is homogeneous. At sufficiently high λ values, one can expect intracoacervate microphase separation: dense domains rich in ionic monomers are surrounded by swollen chain fragments (loops and bridges)
containing predominately neutral units.44 Thus, the coacervate density profile becomes oscillatory, but the domains are electroneutral. This type of microphase separation, analogous
to the formation of complex coacervate core micelles,44−47 should be distinguished from that induced by the short-range incompatibility of oppositely charged PEs, when polycation
and polyanion-rich domains are oppositely charged.48 In conclusion, we have developed a theory of complex coacervation for random polyelectrolytes. It was shown that a high charge blockiness in the primary structure of PEs favors the formation of dense coacervates. Charge blockiness also strongly enhances the coacervate salt resistance, making the region of the solution two-phase state much wider. This effect is due to the improved cooperativity of Coulomb interactions between opposite charges in PEs within the coacervate. Our findings show that the thermodynamic properties of the solution can be controlled through design of the primary structure of polyelectrolytes, which can be tailored using an array of modern copolymerization chemistries.
