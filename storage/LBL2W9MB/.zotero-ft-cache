Figure S1. The TLMEs are projected into the 2D space using t-SNE, labeled by their corresponding
properties (density, melting temperature, and glass transition temperature). Each t-SNE point is colored
by its corresponding property value. Based on the plots, TLMEs are clustered by similar properties, which
indicates that similar polymer structures tend to have similar properties.
