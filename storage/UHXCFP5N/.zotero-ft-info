Title:          NanoReviser: An Error-Correction Tool for Nanopore Sequencing Based on a Deep Learning Algorithm
Subject:        Nanopore sequencing is regarded as one of the most promising third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies. Since 2014, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has
developed a series of devices based on nanopore sequencing to produce very long reads, with an expected impact on genomics.
Keywords:       nanopore sequencing, deep learning, sequencing revising, convolution neural network, long short-term memory networks, DNA methylation
