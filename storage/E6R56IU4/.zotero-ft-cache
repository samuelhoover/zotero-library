The separation of proteins by polyelectrolyte coacervation or precipitation is based on
electrostatically-driven complex formation. We have investigated complexation
between the globular protein BSA and the polyelectrolyte poly(dimethyldiallylammo
nium chloride) (PDMDAAC) using light-scattering techniques to monitor solution
turbidity. Turbidimetric pH titrations were used to determine the specific pH values
where soluble complex formation is initiated (pHc) and where phase separation occurs
(pH*). These values, collected at different ionic strengths, can be presented as phase
boundaries. The effects of macromolecular concentration, protein:polymer concentra
tion ratio (r), and polymer molecular weight upon the phase boundary are examined.
The macromolecular concentration and polymer molecular weight have little or no
effect on the phase boundary. While pHc is independent of r, pH* varies inversely
with r. The use of phase boundaries in the selection of optimal pH and ionic strength
for maximum yield and purity in protein separations is discussed.
Introduction
Current methods of protein purification involve an
extensive series of steps and processes that increase the
cost of the final product. New techniques for large-scale
protein separation are therefore of interest. One of these
involves the addition of polyelectrolytes, leading to selec
tive protein phase separation (Sternberg, 1976; Bozzano
et al., 1991). This phase separation is a result of the
electrostatic interactions between the protein and the
polyelectrolyte which, at very low ionic strength, results
in tight ion-pairing and the formation of amorphous
precipitates (Nguyen, 1986; Stemburg and Hershberger,
1974; Kokufuta et al., 1981). At higher ionic strengths,
however, the charges on both the protein and the poly
electrolyte are shielded by counterions. Because of these
shielding effects, solvent molecules are free to permeate
the complex aggregates, resulting in the formation of a
second liquid phase or coacérvate (Burgess and Carless,
1984; Lenk and Thies, 1987; Dubin et al., 1987; Veis,
1991). Since both coacervation and precipitation con
centrate the target protein, the use of polyelectrolytes for
protein purification carries this additional benefit.
The theory of polyelectrolyte coacervation was first
addressed by Voom and Overbeek (Overbeek and Voom,
1957; Voorn, 1956,1959) and by Veis and Aranyi (1960).
According to Overbeek et al., complex coacervation
reflects a competition between the favorable electrical
free energy, due to the attraction of oppositely charged
particles, and the unfavorable entropy of mixing, which
would tend to disperse the particles. Short-range elec
trostatic interactions are neglected, and the possibility
of complexation between particles with the same charge
sign is excluded. On the basis of work with gelatins of
different isoionic points, Veis et al. suggested a modifica
tion to the Voom—Overbeek theory, central to which is
the formatioin of soluble complexes prior to coacervation.
Phase separation is a result of the aggregation of these
nearly neutral polyions. Recent electrophoretic and
dynamic light-scattering studies by Dubin et al have
verified the existence of such soluble complexes for
protein—polyelectrolyte systems (Dubin and Murrell,
1988; Xia et al., 1993). These “primary” soluble com
plexes were on the same order of size as the free
polyelectrolyte and displayed a pH-dependent mobility
that decreased to zero at the point of coacervation. Park
et al. found that formation of soluble protein—polyelec
trolyte complex was initiated at a specific pH and that
this “pHc” was a function of the ionic strength, the protein
isoelectric point, and the charge density of the polyelec
trolyte (Park et al., 1992). For polycations, pHc preceded
the pH of visual phase separation, designated as pH*.
Since these soluble complexes can be considered a
separate phase, the ionic strength dependences of both
pHc and pH* can be viewed as phase boundaries.
In applying polyelectrolytes to selective protein separa
tions, it is important to consider both phase transitions.
The phase boundaries of different proteins can be utilized
for systems containing several proteins, as a means of
selecting the optimal pH and ionic strength for maximum
yield and purity. An example of this is shown in Figure
1, which displays hypothetical phase boundaries for a
two-protein single-polyelectrolyte solution. In this figure,
the broken lines represent the transition to soluble
complex (pHc), and the solid lines represent the transition
to coacérvate (pH*). In region A, neither protein is
associated with polyelectrolyte; in region B, protein 1 has
formed soluble complexes and protein 2 is nonassociated;
in region C, protein 1 is coacervated while protein 2 is
still unassociated; in region D, protein 2 has formed a
soluble complex; in region E, both proteins are coacer
vated. The optimal conditions for selective protein
separation are those corresponding to region C.
In this study, the ionic strength and concentration
dependences of pHc and pH* were obtained for the BSA/
PDMDAAC system. These phase boundaries are dis
cussed in terms of the nature of protein—polyelectrolyte
interactions. Their utility in maximizing yield and purity
in protein separation processes is considered.

were prepared by preparative SEC and characterized by
several methods (Xia et al., 1994). Bovine serum albumin
(BSA), with a molecular weight of 67 000 and a pi of 4.9,
was received from Sigma Chemical Co. as 95-99% pure
lyophilized protein and was used without further puri
fication. Instruments. An Orion pH meter with a combination
electrode was used to monitor the solution pH. Turbidi
ties were measured in four ways. Transmittance was
monitored with either a Brinkman PC 800 colorimeter,
connected to a 2 cm path length optical probe, or a
Perkin-Elmer HP8450A UV—vis spectrometer. The tur
bidity was reported as 100 - %T, and %T fluctuations
(±0.1 %) were treated by consistently selecting the
highest value. The mean intensity of 90° scattered light
was measured with a 200 mW argon laser-equipped
Brookhaven Instrument (Model No. BI-AT) and a Brice
Phoenix Series 2000 light scattering photometer.
Turbidimetric Titrations. The dependence of solu
tion turbidity on pH (“type 1 titration”) was obtained by
the addition of 0.1 M NaOH to a protein-polymer
mixture at constant ionic strength (I) and at constant
polymer and protein concentrations. BSA and PDMDAAC
solutions were prepared independently and filtered
through Gelman 0.2 μ . filters prior to mixing. Upon
addition of base, the solution was gently stirred until a
stable %T (±0.1) reading was obtained. The stirring time
was generally 2-3 min, and kinetic reversibility (with
the addition of acid) was always observed. A nitrogen
purge was employed during all titrations. Polymer-free
blanks were used to eliminate the effect of the scattering
of free protein. The possibility of gradual protein adsorp
tion onto the probe tips was minimized by limiting the
titration time, including blanks, to approximately 1 h (±10 min). Macromolecular Charge. The net charge of BSA at
various I and pH values, was determined by titrating a
25 mL polymer-free protein solution from the pi, either
with 0.1 M HC1 or with 0.1 M NaOH, using a 2.0 mL
Gilmont microburet accurate to 0.001 mL. A solvent blank was used to determine the direct contribution of HC1 or NaOH to the solution pH. By subtracting the
volume of acid or base used in the blank from the volume of acid or base used in the polymer-free sample, the
specific number of H+ or OH- ions contributing to the
net protein charge was determined. pH titration curves
for BSA with and without polymer were generated by
lowering the solution pH to 4.2 wth 0.1 M HC1 and then

to ensure that all solutions had weights that were equal
to within 1 mg prior to titration. With such precautions,
titration curves were reproducible to ±0.03 pH units.
Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the results of a “type 1 titration”
monitored with a UV spectrometer and a colorimeter. A
region of soluble complex formation is revealed by the
increase in turbidity between the pH values of 4.6 and
7.4, which although subtle, is quite reproducible. At pH
values less than 4.6 (pH), Coulombic repulsive forces
between the positively charged protein and the positively
charged polyelectrolyte prevent the formation of com
plexes, and the protein and polymer molecules coexist
as separate entities within the solution. At pH values
greater than 7.4 (pHX a substantial increase in turbidity
indicates the presence of coacérvate. While pH can be
easily determined, pHc is less exactly identified as the
point at which the turbidity or scattering intensity
departs from a constant value. Because of the limited
sensitivity of transmittance measurements, determina
tion of an exact pH value by UV absorbance is sometimes
difficult. This problem can be circumvented, however,
by utilizing more direct measures of particle scattering.
This is demonstrated by Figure 3 which shows the same
type 1 titration monitored with the Brice Phoenix and
Brookhaven instruments. Because of the weak scattering
of free polymer and free protein, the abrupt deviation in
the total scattering intensity at pHc can only be at
tributed to the presence of soluble complex. The use of
these instruments entails an increase in sample prepara
tion and run time arising from instrument sensitivity to
dust and foreign particle events. Experimental time was
minimized, however, by using turbidity to estimate pHc
and then total scattering intensity to determine pHc
precisely.
The effects of macromolecular concentration on pH
and pH can be seen in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4 shows
type 1 titrations for three different protein concentra
tions, with the protein to polymer concentration ratio
([BSA]/[PDMDAAC] = r) held constant. The results
indicate that, within the present concentration range, the
total solute concentration, at constant r, has no effect on
either pHc or pH· Figure 5 further indicates that pH
is independent of r as well, while pH varies inversely
with r.
The finding that pH0 is inversely dependent on r can
be explained if coacervation results from charge neutral

ization of the primary complex as given by eq 1, where
ZT = ZP + nZ.ir ( · )0 = 0 (1)
Zp is the net polymer charge (independent of pH), n is
the mean number of bound proteins per polymer chain,
is the charge of the primary complex, and Zpr is the
pH-dependent protein charge (Strege et al., 1990). If
protein binding at pH > pHc follows a mass-action
equilibrium, it can be assumed that n will increase with
r. The assumption that n increases with r implies that,
after complexation is initiated at pHc, an equilibrium
exists similar to the one schematically depicted below,
where the solid ovals represent proteins and the line
represents a single polymer chain.
When n increases, the charge per protein molecule
required to achieve complex neutralization decreases,
which results in a subsequent decrease in pH*. It should
be pointed out that these simple descriptions neglect the
possibility of cooperative binding, leading to a nonuniform
distribution of BSA among the polymer chains. There
appears to be at least circumstantial evidence for such
cooperative binding (Li et al., 1995; Kabanov and Mustafaev, 1981).
The absence of any effect of protein or polymer con
centration on pHc is important for two reasons. First, it
greately reduces the number of variables, inasmuch as
pHc is then a function only of the ionic strength. Second,
it suggests that initial complex formation is controlled
by the interaction between a single protein molecule and
a single sequence of polymer segments and does not
follow a mass-action law. The apparent contradiction
between this statement and the mass-action equilibrium
of eq 2 can be explained if the binding constant (K) is a
strong function of protein charge density ( ). The
electrostatic nature of the binding constant is supported
by Park et al., who found that both pHc and pH* were
dependent upon the linear charge density of the poly
electrolyte (Park et al., 1992). These findings indicate
that the binding constant is a function of protein surface
charge density and polyelectrolyte linear charge density.
Prior to pHc, is too small to initiate complexation. At
pH > pHc, however, has increased enough for the
mass action effects to be observed, i.e. = f{r).
On the basis of electrostatic shielding effects, one would
expect pHc and pH* to increase with increasing ionic
strength. The expected qualitative dependence of these
values on I is seen in Figure 6, which clearly indicates
that, as the ionic strength is increased, pHc and pH* also
increase.
The effect of polyelectrolyte molecular weight on pHc
and pH* is shown in Figure 7, which contains type 1
titrations for PDMDAAC fractions with molecular weights
22K, 780K, and 1250K at 1 = 0.10 M NaCl. The constant
pHc and pH* values shown, 4.4 and 6.8, respectively, are
in good agreement with the values obtained for the
polydisperse Merquat sample (4.4 and 6.9). These results
show that neither the polymer MW nor its polydispersity
have any effect on pHc or pH*. This result is consistent
with the preceding description of the interaction in terms
of a relatively short sequence of polymer segments.
The dependence of pH* on polymer molecular weight
was also examined by Sheih and Glatz (1994) for PAA
lysozyme and PAA—ovalbumin complexes. Within the
weight range of 5000—500 000, pH* was reported to be
independent of polymer molecular weight, although some
deviation in pH* was observed at MW = 4 000 000. This
effect might result from self-aggregation of larger colloids.
However, differences between Glatz’s system and ours
preclude more direct comparisons.
The dependence of pHc and pH* on ionic strength
constitutes a phase boundary which, as shown in Figure
8, separates the nonassociative, soluble complex, and
coacérvate regions. The results for titrations carried out
at different r values confirm the insensitivity of pHc to r
at different I.

In Figure 9, the data of Figure 8 are plotted as Zpr (net
protein charge) versus 71/2, corresponding to both pHc
(upper curve) and pH# (lower curve). We first note the
linearity of the upper (Zpr)c boundary. Im dependence is
characteristic of systems controlled by Coulombic forces,
and this observation confirms the supposition that bind
ing is driven by electrostatic interactions between the
protein and the poly electrolyte. Thus, it can be proposed
that the degree of shielding or the thickness of the ionic
atmosphere has an important effect on the value of (Zpr)c.
The linear dependence of (Zpr)c on 71/2 resembles the
results of McQuigg et al. (1992), who studied polyelec
trolytes and oppositely charged micelles and observed a
linear dependence of micelle surface charge density ( )
on 71/2 at the point of incipient polyelectrolyte binding.
Theoretical justifications for the linearity of ucrit with 71/2
were first reported by Evers et al. for the binding of
polyions to planar charged surfaces (Evers et al., 1986).
For the same systems, Muthukumar (1987) found a more
complex relation between ocrit and 7. On the other hand,
Odijk (1980) also reached the conclusion that acrit was
proportional to 71/2 from a completely different approach.
While the treatments of Evers, Muthukumar, and Odijk
are for polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged planar
surfaces, Manning et al. recently considered polyelectro
lytes and spherical colloids (Manning, 1994). They
defined the critical binding energy as the sum of a
favorable ionic attraction energy and an unfavorable
elastic stress arising from the bending of the polymer
around the colloid. Combining the ionic attraction energy
(from the Debye—Huckel approximation, with no coun

terion condensation), with the elastic stress (from a
Hookean bending constant, obtained from the persistence
length), they calculated the critical binding colloid charge
density and observed that acrit was proportional to 71/2.
Inspection of the low ionic strength region of Figure 9
reveals the initial formation of soluble complex at pH
values such that the net charge on the protein is positive
(same sign as that of the polyelectrolyte). The formation
of complexes between proteins and polyelectrolytes under
conditions at which the protein net charge is of the same
sign as the polymer's has been observed by others (Tsung
and Thompson, 1965; Hoffe, 1964; Mustafaev et al., 1975).
One interpretation of this behavior depends on the
presence of a negatively charged “patch”, such that
complexation at pHc is a result of electrostatic interac
tions between the polyelectrolyte and some local protein
region, as opposed to the global protein surface. Evidence
for the presence of protein charge patches was reported
by Lesins and Ruckenstein (1989), who found significant
retention of positively charged proteins on positively
charged anion exchange columns. Further evidence of a
protein charge patch was reported by Kopaciewicz et al.
(1983), who also showed that proteins could be retained
on an ion exchange column, even when the protein charge
had the same sign as the column.
A paradox emerges from the linearity of (Zpr)c in both
Zpr < 0 and Zpr > 0 regimes. The simplicity of the
relationship observed when the total protein charge is
used suggests that the interaction is controlled by the
global charge. However, the observation of Zpr > 0 at

low 7 indicates the presence of negatively charged protein
patches which act as polyelectrolyte binding sites. One
possible explanation for this contradiction is that the
global charge of BSA is proportional to the patch surface
charge density at pH < pHc.
An alternate explanation for initial complexation at pH
< p7 was offered by a reviewer of this paper, who
suggested that the charge on complexed protein might
be more negative than the charge on free protein at the
same pH because binding to the polymer produces a pKa
shift in the direction of higher protein acidity. Therefore
potentiometric titrations were carried out for BSA, (3.0
g/L), in 0.16 M NaCl, in the presence and absence of
PDMDAAC (0.6 g/L). As shown in Figure 10, the pH
titration curve of BSA in the presence of PDMDAAC does
indeed diverge from the polymer-free control in the
expected direction. The shift, although subtle, is never
theless reproducible. No particular influence of phase
separation on the titration curve is observed. From the
horizontal difference between the two curves, corresponding to the difference in OHTM uptake, we can
calculate the difference in net charge for protein in the
presence and absence of PDMDAAC, at any pH, AZpr,
shown in Figure 11 A.
It is not clear whether the effect of PDMDAAC on protein dissociation can account for pHc < p7; in the
vicinity of pHc, AZpr is quite small, less than one charge
unit. However, it is possible that larger absolute values
of AZpr might be observed at lower 7 where pHc < p7 is
found. Furthermore, it is important to note that the
measured value of AZpr represents an average between
the free and bound proteins that are likely to coexist near
pHc: in other words, experiments carried out in the
presence of excess polymer might reveal larger p7? shifts.
The preceding argument suggests consideration of a
two-state model, in which bound proteins constitute a
single, well-defined species, so that the gradual diver
gence of the two curves in Figure 10 represents a
transition from the titration curve of the unbound protein
(upper curve) to the titration curve of the fully bound
protein (currently unknown, but perhaps approached by
the lower curve at high pH). Comparison between AZpr
vs pH and turbidity vs pH in Figure 11A,B may be
relevant. AZpr deviates from zero at the turbidimetric
pHc, but also, the curves continue to be very similar at
higher pH. If the region 5 < pH < 9 corresponds to the
progressive formation of a well-defined soluble complex,
the scattering intensity and AZpr might both vary with
the relative concentration of this species, giving rise to
the behavior seen in Figure 11. While these interpreta

tions are at present highly speculative, they point the
way toward further analysis of pH titration curves
obtained at a variety of ionic strengths and protein:
polymer stoichiometries.
A second interesting feature of Figure 9 is the asymp
totic behavior of { ) at lower ionic strengths. This
behavior is important for two reasons. First, it lends
support to the electroneutrality condition (eq 1): since
the polymer charge is always positive, zero net charge
can only be obtained with Zpr < 0, so that coacervation
requires ( ) < 0. Second, it presents a qualitative
approach to selecting the best ionic strength for maxi
mum protein yield. For optimal protein separation in
multi-protein solutions, one would prefer to minimize the
pH range of the soluble complex, i.e., pHc-pH^. At lower
7, pHc-pH# widens, leading to the likelihood of a larger
pH regime over which several proteins may complex
simultaneously, hence poorer separation. At higher 7,
however, is seems probable that the number of proteins
bound per polymer chain will diminish, along with the
yield. For this system then, the optimum ionic strength
would correspond to the location of the slope change of
the ( ) curve, i.e. 7 = 0.09 M or 7172 = 0.30. Similar
conclusions were offered by other groups (Clark and
Glatz, 1990; Niederauer et al., 1994; Suominen et al.,
1993) who have found that better protein selectivity could
be attained at moderate ionic strength.
According to eq 1, it is possible to determine the
number of bound proteins at the coacervation point. On
the basis of the average polymer molecular weight and
the charge per formula unit of PDMDAAC, the average
total charge of the polyelectrolyte chain is 1.2 x 103.
When this value is divided by the charge on the protein
at pH,*, [( ) = —12 for BSA at 7 = 0.1, r = 40], the
number of bound proteins can be estimated at ca. 100.
This value is consistent with the results obtained by
Ahmed, Kokufuta, Xia, and Dubin (1994), who reported
that for the BSA/PDMDAAC system at an ionic strength
of 0.1 M NaCl, and in the limit of r — <», the average
number of bound proteins per polymer chain is approximately 120.
Conclusions
The use of phase boundaries for optimizing selective
protein separations is so far untried. However, the


Biotechnol. Prog., 1995, Vol. 11, No. 6 637
presence of the primary soluble complex, originally
predicted by the Veis-Aranyi theory, appears to be an
important characteristic of these systems. These soluble
complexes are initiated at a specific ionic strength
dependent pHc, and visible phase separation (pH$) is
achieved when their charge approaches zero. The phase
boundaries arising from the ionic strength dependence
of pHc and pH(i lead to insight into the binding mecha
nism which could help optimize purity and yield in future protein separations.
