ABSTRACT: We investigate the effect of charge block length on polyampholyte chain conformation and phase behavior using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and implicit-solvent molecular simulations. To this end, we use solid phase peptide synthesis to precision-tailor a series of polyampholytes consisting of L-glutamic acid (E) and L-lysine (K) monomers arranged in alternating blocks from 2 to 16 monomers. We observe that the polyampholytes tend to phase separate as block size increases. With addition of NaCl, phase separated polyampholytes exhibit a salting-in effect dependent on charge block length. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that are disrupted upon the addition of NaCl, implicating both electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding in the phase behavior. SAXS spectra at no-added salt conditions show minimal dependence of charge block length on the radius of gyration (Rg) for soluble polyampholytes, but local chain stiffening is found to be dependent on charge block length. With increasing NaCl, consistent with electrostatic screening, all polyampholytes expand and behave as neutral or swollen chains in good solvent conditions. Molecular simulations are qualitatively consistent with experiments. Implications for understanding intracellular condensates and material design are noted.
P
olyampholytes are polymers that contain both positively and negatively ionizable groups along their backbone, leading to a wide range of inter- and intrachain interactions. These interactions influence chain conformation and dynamics and may be exploited to tune the rheological response of polyampholyte-based materials for applications including flocculation, water desalination, and biomimetic tissue
engineering.1−10 Total charge fraction and charge asymmetry have been shown to influence chain conformation and properties such as viscosity and conductivity in polyampholyte solutions.4 However, there is limited fundamental understanding of how these properties are influenced by the sequence of the charged monomers. This knowledge is critical to understanding how intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) drive intracellular phase separation of biological condensates. Several theoretical descriptions have been developed to investigate the effects of charge sequence on IDP phase behavior and have shown that an increase in charge block length promotes chain collapse and phase separation.11,12 Nonetheless, these predictions have not been tested exper
imentally against model systems where block length may be systematically varied. Here, we systematically test the influence of charge block length on polyampholyte chain conformation and phase behavior using a combination of sequence-precise synthesis, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and implicit-solvent molecular simulations. We show that local chain conformation and phase behavior are influenced by charge block length and may be tuned by varying salt concentration. This has implications in IDP phase behavior and design of polymapholyte-based materials. Our experimental system consists of a series of charge neutral polyampholytes with 16 L-glutamic acid and 16 L-lysine monomers arranged in block lengths of Np = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16

produced using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS; Figure 1). This strategy provides precise control over sequence, molecular weight, and chirality, thus enabling direct investigation of the role of charge block length on IDP, and more generally, polyampholyte solution behavior. In addition, the identical hydrophilic backbone structures and similar side chain chemistry allow for the effects of electrostatic interactions to be directly examined. Detailed synthesis, characterization, and solution preparation protocols of the polypeptide-based polyampholytes are described in the Supporting Information (SI). Polyampholyte phase behavior (Figure 2) was quantified through turbidity measurements of 1 wt % polyampholyte solutions at various NaCl concentrations. At low added salt
conditions, turbidity measurements show that an increase in Np leads to greater phase separation tendency (Figure 2). At high added salt conditions, large Np polyampholytes exhibit a charge block length dependent “salting-in” behavior, where the minimum salt concentration increases as block length increases. This behavior is attributed to screening electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged groups and is comparable to critical salt concentrations observed for phase separated mixtures of homochiral poly(L-lysine) and poly(Lglutamic acid) (Figure S2). Hence, Coulomb attraction of opposite charges, which vary in strength with charge block length, play a role in phase separation. Interestingly, Np = 2 deviates from the trend in phase behavior and exhibits slight turbidity even at low salt concentrations. In addition to electrostatic interactions between charged side chains, polypeptide-based polyampholytes may also interact via inter- and intrachain hydrogen bond formation. At no addedsalt conditions, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the presence of hydrogen bonding for all block lengths (except Np = 4), as indicated by the peak at 1624
cm−1 attributed to β-sheet structures (Figure S3). As the block length increases, there is a higher propensity for hydrogen
bond interactions indicated by a red shift of the 1624 cm−1
peak to 1611 cm−1, along with a decrease in magnitude of the
1644 cm−1 peak associated with random coil chain
conformation (Figure S3).13,14 These results are consistent with the phase behavior previously observed for racemic polypeptide-based polyampholytes, where evidence of hydro
gen bond formation was only found for the diblock sequence.15 Similar behavior is also exhibited for homochiral polypeptidebased polyelectrolytes that undergo phase separation, forming solid-like complexes consisting of hydrogen-bonded β-sheet
structures.14,16,17 Thus, these observations indicate that phase behavior is driven by a combination of charge block length dependent electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions. The dependence of charge block length on polyampholyte phase behavior noted above suggests the importance of
understanding dilute solution chain conformation.18 To investigate chain conformation, we measure scattering intensity curves, I(q), using SAXS at beamline 12-ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Dilute polyampholyte solutions at 2 wt % were irradiated in 2 mm quartz capillaries at 13 keV at a detector distance of 4 m (q-range =
0.002−0.5 Å−1) for 0.1 s at 25 °C. The two-dimensional data were converted to one-dimensional scattering curves using the SAXSLee package and then background subtracted and

analyzed using in-house Jupyter Notebook scripts (SI). The scattering intensity curves I(q) for Np < 8 at no-added salt solution conditions (Figure 3A) exhibit a high-q scaling
corresponding to I ∼ q−1/ν, where ν is between 0.5 and 0.33, indicative of polymer behavior in theta to poor solvent quality
conditions.19 This observation suggests, in agreement with
some earlier simulation studies,20,21 that intramolecular electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interactions are at play in collapsing the polypeptide-based polyampholytes despite a favorable hydration environment for both side chain and backbone chemistry.
To investigate the influence of charge block length on chain size, the radius of gyration Rg was calculated from the forward scattering intensity I(q = 0) by extrapolation from a linear fit of
a Guinier plot (ln(I) vs q2) in the region where qmaxRg < 1.3 (SI). Interestingly, we observe minimal differences in Rg for Np < 8 polyampholytes, suggesting there is very little charge block length dependence on chain size (Figure 3B). We compare this to implicit-solvent molecular simulations, which exhibit qualitative agreement with experimental data. In particular,
the GB/SA model,22,23 which better treats the collective
properties of hydration24 as compared to the ABSINTH25 implicit solvent model, better captures experimentally determined Rg as well. (GB/SA and ABSINTH are briefly explained in the SI.) These observations indicate that differences in phase behavior and hydrogen bond interactions do not influence the global chain size for this set of small charge block length polyampholytes. We hypothesize that the small block length limits intrachain interactions to local
dipoles,15,26 supporting the reduced influence of block length on Rg (a global measure). GB/SA simulations further support that hydrogen bond interactions are restricted to local scales (Figure S9). These results are at variance with results from field theoretic and complementary MD simulations of a bead− spring model that show that polyampholyte coil size decreases
with increasing block length.11 That study examined a larger range of block lengths not easily accessible experimentally, but the models also lack the chemical detail present in experiments and in models such as GB/SA or ABSINTH. Which, if any, of these explains the difference is an important issue and is left for future studies. To investigate the influence of charge block length on local length scales and chain shape the SAXS data was plotted in a
dimensionless Kratky representation (q2Rg2·I(q)/I(0) vs qRg).
Here, we observe peaks at q ∼ 0.19, 0.20, and 0.23 Å−1 corresponding to 16.5, 15.5, and 13.5 Å for Np = 1, 2, and 4, respectively, which are consistent with Rg values calculated from the Guinier analysis (Figure 4). The shape of the curve in a Kratky representation provides qualitative information on the conformation of polymers in solution. Specifically, we observe that all sequences deviate from the Debye form factor for an ideal chain at high q and that the peak positions appear at values qR 3
g > and above 1.1 (Figure 4), both indicative of
polymers in an unfolded globular conformation.27−29 Yet, for Np = 1, there is a slight upturn at qRg ∼ 5, which reveals chain stiffening at local length scales ∼9 Å or about 2−3 amino acid monomers (Figure 4). Neighboring interactions may lead to

electrostatic repulsion and chain stiffening for the purely Lchiral (EK)16 side chain sterochemistry (Figure S12). These local structural effects may influence polyampholyte chain dynamics and will be a subject for future study. SAXS measurements at no-added salt conditions show that polyampholytes exhibit collapsed chain behavior attributed to electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions. To further assess the effects of electrostatic interactions, we vary the solution NaCl concentration and measure scattering intensity using SAXS (Figure 5). As salt concentration is increased, the scattering intensity at high-q shows a charge block length dependent scaling behavior that corresponds to a transition from theta to good solvent conditions (Figure S6). This is consistent with the “salting-in” behavior (Figure 2) and previous studies on statistical polyampholyte phase behavior that show a salt induced theta condition below which chains
collapse and phase separate.4,30 The upturn present at low-q may be indicative of inhomogeneous density fluctuations,
however the physical origin remains unknown.17 Dimensionless Kratky representations further show that polyampholytes transition from collapsed to swollen chains through an ideal random coil condition as salt concentration is increased (Figures 5D and S5). Overall, we observe that increasing the block length increases the salt concentration necessary to reach theta condition, thus indicating that polyampholytes exhibit charge block length dependent chain conformation with varying salt concentration. For charge neutral polyampholytes, it is expected that increasing salt concentration will result in an increase in chain size by screening attractive Coulombic interactions. Here, we observe a charge block length dependent increase in Rg with increasing NaCl concentration, where at 3 M NaCl Rg converges to ∼16−17 Å for all sequences (Figure 5B). GB/SA simulations support our experimental observations, showing an increase and convergence of Rg for the all polyampholytes with increasing NaCl concentration (Figure 5C). At 3000 mM NaCl, FTIR shows that all polyampholytes
exhibit a random coil structure with no secondary structure present (Figure S3). We posit that the charge-driven interactions that collapse polyampholyte chain conformation also mediate hydrogen bond interactions. This result is significant because it suggests that salt can be used to tune the stronger shorter range directional interactions as well as the
long-range electrostatic interactions.31,32 Note that the saltinduced tuning of short-range directional physics is outside the scope of a Debye screening description, and this has implications for developing theories/models of polyampholytes. Polyampholytes show charge block length dependent phase behavior and conformation with varying salt conditions, indicating that the local counterion and solvent environment may play a role in dictating chain behavior. To investigate the effect of sequence on the local counterion environment, we performed NaOH and HCl pH titrations. We observe that the Np > 4 polyampholytes exhibit more buffering capacity, suggesting that counterions remain coupled to the chains (Figure S8). This is consistent with previous simulation results that showed an increase in salt ion localization and tendency
for phase separation with increasing charge block length.15 This behavior seems to suggest that the ionization state would
be lower for sequences with large block lengths.33−36 However, simulation studies have shown that the association of oppositely charged weak polyampholytes leads to an increase in ionization due to energetically favorable electrostatic
interactions.37,38 In addition to electrostatic interactions, chain conformation, concentration and type of salt, and chain hydrophobicity have also been shown to affect ionization
state in polyelectrolytes.39 Thus, investigating how these effects influence polyampholyte ionization remains an interesting topic for future study. In summary, charge block length directly affects chain conformation and phase behavior of polyampholyte molecules. For charge block length Np > 4 polyampholytes, in the absence of added salt, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding

lead to phase separation or self-coacervation of the oppositely charged segments. These interactions may be tuned by varying salt concentration resulting in charge block length dependent swelling of polyampholyte chains and dissolution into a single phase as they transition to good solvent quality behavior. For Np ≤ 4 polyampholytes, in the absence of added salt, we observe collapsed chain conformations with poor to theta solvent quality behavior. No phase separation was observed for these sequences, which we hypothesize is due to weaker salt ion localization and a decrease in the entropic driving force to phase separate. With increasing salt concentration, the Np ≤ 4 polyampholytes transition from poor to good solvent quality conditions and show charge block length dependent swelling behavior. In addition, high salt concentration disrupts hydrogen bonding for all sequences, thus further weakening the propensity to phase separate. Future investigations will focus on varying the molecular weight of sequence precise
polyampholytes to test scaling theories.4,26,40,41 Neutron scattering and contrast variation can also be applied to polyampholyte systems to determine solvent and counterion distributions at varying Debye lengths to improve our understanding of the local environment and ionization states
of sequence-precise polyampholytes.42,43 This study serves as a step toward understanding the role of polyampholyte sequence on chain conformation and phase behavior and broaden our understanding of intracellular IDP behavior.
