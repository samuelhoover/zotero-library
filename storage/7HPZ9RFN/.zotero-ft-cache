ABSTRACT
Block copolymers show various microphase-separated structures depending on their chain architecture and the interaction parameters between the different chemical structures of monomeric unit χ. Self-consistent field theory is a powerful tool to predict such phase-separated structures, and phase diagrams of block copolymers have been reported using self-consistent field theory. However, obtaining stable morphology of each polymer structure and the χ parameter requires intensive computational study. We applied deep learning to predict phase diagrams from metastable structures obtained by crude, cost-effective self-consistent field calculation. We used a 3D convolutional neural network for classification of the metastable structures, and a limited number of sets of block copolymer structures and χ parameters with stable phase labels were used for training. After the model was trained using the training set, it successfully assigned the metastable structures of a wide variety of diblock and triblock copolymers to the correct stable phases. This approach is capable of predicting the phase diagrams of block copolymers effectively without intensive self-consistent field calculation.
1. Introduction
Block copolymers consist of multiple sub-chains with different chemical structures, and the sub-chains are connected by chemical bonds. Block copolymers have many topological shapes, such as linear, star, and comb-like chains. When the chain length of each block is long enough and the attractive interactions between different chemical structures are weak, these blocks are not miscible and show a multiphase structure. However, the immiscible blocks are connected by chemical bonds; thus, the size of the phase-separated domains is restricted to the order of magnitude of the chain length. That type of phase separation is known as microphase separation. Several typical morphologies of microphase separation of block copolymers have been observed, such as body center cubic sphere (S in figures), hexagonal cylinder (C), double gyroid (G), and lamellar (L) structure. When different blocks are miscible, the homogenous disorder state (D) can be observed in addition to phase-separated morphology. Such morphologies depend on chain length, the volume fraction of each block, and the interaction parameter χ between different blocks. The χ parameter corresponds to the miscibility between different chemical structures in each block chain, and larger values of χ mean less miscibility. The parameter χ multiplied by the number of segments in a chain N, expressed as χN, is a miscibility criterion in polymer chains. The phase diagrams for typical block copolymers are well studied by
both theoretical calculations [1–6] and experiments [7–9]. Selfconsistent field theory (SCFT) is a powerful method to predict the microphase-separated structure of block copolymers [10–12]. SCFT applies topological information about polymer chains by solving the Edwards equation [10], and the system’s free energy consists of a configurational entropic part and an enthalpic part calculated on the basis of the interactions between different chemical structures. Stable morphology can be determined by comparing the free energy of various morphologies, and intensive calculations are needed to obtain the precise free energy of each morphology, including unit cell size optimization of the periodic structure. This process requires much computational cost. If we skip this rigorous step, we cannot obtain the most stable structure, and many metastable structures are observed. Although there should be structural similarity between the stable morphology and metastable structures, it is currently difficult to assign stable morphology from such metastable structures by numerical analysis of the metastable structures. Recently, machine learning has been widely used in materials science, including application to polymeric materials [13–22]. The training sets have included atomistic-level molecular and crystalline structures and higher-order structures such as heterogeneous-phase polymer blends and polymer–filler composites. The convolutional neural network (CNN) [23] is a widely employed method of 2D image recognition [24–26]. CNN methods can be extended to 3D images (3DCNN),

and 3DCNN was applied for the investigation of structure–property relationships of composite materials [27,28]. Yang [27] produced the microstructures of a two-component composite with contrasting physical properties such as stiffness. Then, a 3DCNN was trained with information about the structure and stiffness of composites obtained by finite element analysis. Although that approach succeeded in predicting properties from microstructure, those microstructures were obtained using a statistical approach [29] with no physical background. We applied such an approach to classify metastable structures obtained by SCFT calculation based on a well-established physical background. The objective of image recognition of metastable structures obtained by SCFT calculation of block copolymers is to predict the copolymers’ stable morphologies from their metastable structures by associating the metastable structures with stable phase labels. If that association is accurate, the model should be able to predict copolymers’ stable morphologies on the basis of their corresponding metastable structures from crude, inexpensive SCFT calculation.
2. Polymer samples and SCFT calculation
We focused on block copolymer structures, which are well studied by precise SCFT calculation. AB-type block copolymers are the system with the most-studied phase diagrams. Matsen published an excellent review on studies of phase diagrams of AB-type block copolymers [2]. The training sets have primarily consisted of phase diagrams of AB diblock copolymers. However, we noticed that the phase diagrams of diblock copolymers were symmetrically shaped in a pattern that varied according to their volume fractions, and the volume fractions could be the main descriptor in the model to find the stable morphology. Thus, in addition to the diblock copolymers, we used AB2 star block copolymers in our training set. The reason of the choice of the AB2 star block copolymers is that the structure is simple in brunched polymers and the phase diagram are well studied [2]. Fig. 1 shows the sets of volume fractions and χN values used in the training set. As little selection as possible was performed on those conditions so that all phases would be included and critical phase boundaries could be clarified. As AB diblock copolymers have symmetric distributions of the A and B blocks, only the A segment-minor region (fA ≤ 0.5) was used as an AB diblock copolymer, while the A segment-rich region was considered as an AB2 star block copolymer. Although phase-space SCFT calculations are often conducted to predict highly symmetric stable-phase structures, we conducted realspace SCFT calculations to obtain metastable structures that had little symmetry and would have been difficult to obtain by phase-space
calculation. The SUSHI package [30], a component of the OCTA system [31,32], was used for the real-space SCFT calculation. In the realspace SCFT calculation, the statistical weight of a chain is obtained by solving the following Edwards equation:
∂
∂tQK (i, r) =
[b2
6 ∇2 VK (r)
]
QK (i, r) (1)
where QK(i,r) is the path integral describing the equilibrium statistical weight of the ith segment of segment type K located at r, b is the Kuhn statistical length, and VK is the self-consistent field, which is determined by the incompressible condition and the interaction between segments. The details of the implementation in SUSHI can be found in the references [30,32]. In the SUSHI implementation, the chain length was defined as Nb. N was set to 20 and 40 for each point, and the length of the A block and the χ parameter were determined by the corresponding volume fraction and χN in the phase diagram, respectively. The system size was set as a 32 × 32 × 32[b] cubic cell with periodic boundary conditions. We obtained 100–200 structures at each point and chain length by beginning the calculation from a homogenous state and adding different random initial noise during each iteration. We confirmed the free energy converged after the iteration of SCFT calculation (typically 20,000 iterations). Thus, we concluded that the obtained structures were metastable structures and not unstable ones. We should note that these structures were obtained by spinodal decomposition from homogenous state and the phase boundary could be slightly different from binodal phase boundary by conducting rigorous minimization of free energy. Fig. 2 shows examples of the metastable structures for each stable phase. In total, 3000 metastable structures were used for training of the 3DCNN. Test dataset was taken from the full range of phase diagrams of AB diblock copolymers and AB2 star block copolymers with volume fractions of the A segment ranging 0.05–0.50 and 0.05–0.95, respectively (χN ranged 10–40 for both copolymer types). In addition to the copolymer types used for training, ABA asymmetric triblock copolymers were included in the test dataset, because they are the simplest structure in asymmetric multiblock copolymers. The phase diagrams of asymmetric triblock copolymers were also studied by Matsen [3]. The phase boundary changed in terms of asymmetricity, which was defined as τ in ref. [3]. Three sets of metastable structures for each set of polymer structure and χN were obtained by SCFT calculation to predict the stable phase.

3. Deep learning method
Fig. 3 shows the 3DCNN architecture used in this study. The inputs were sets of volume fractions of each segment type in each 32 × 32 × 32 grid voxel (obtained from SCFT calculation) and a one-hot vector of the five types of stable phase labels for the corresponding set of polymer structures and χN values. We neglected to include the O70, Ssp, and SA15 phases in the precise phase diagrams because the region of the O70 phase is very narrow, and the Ssp and SA15 phases are difficult to separate from the S phase. Four convolutional layers and two max-pooling layers were followed by flatten and dense layers. A ReLU function [33] was used for activation of each layer except the last one. A softmax function [34] was used for the activation of last layer to output the probabilities of the five phases. Dropout with a 0.4 drop rate was applied after each of the two max pooling layers and the first dense layer to avoid overfitting. To increase accuracy of prediction in machine learning, it is desirable to use as large of a dataset as possible. Thus, we increased the number of training data by exchanging the axes of the calculated volume fraction data, i.e., (x,y,z) data were changed to (z,x,y), (y,z,x), (z,y,x), (y,x,z), and (x,z,y). These exchanges performed a six-fold augmentation on the number of data. In addition, the volume fraction of segment B was used in addition to that of segment A, as both volume fractions should result in the same isosurface. This operation doubled the total number of data. The above processes increased the number of data from 3000 to 36,000. The 3DCNN was implemented using Tensorflow 2.1.0 [35]. We assigned 80% and 20% of the all training dataset as the training and validation sets, respectively. The Adam optimizer [36] was used to associate the volume fraction data with the categorized stable phase
labels. Categorical cross-entropy [37] was used as the loss function, and the batch size was set to 32. After 1000 epochs, the loss and accuracy
were 8 × 10 7 and 1.000 for trained data and 0.0066 and 0.9982 for validation data, respectively. This result indicated good training accuracy, and the accuracy for validation data was good enough although a little overfitting was observed. Stable phases were predicted for the test dataset using the trained 3DCNN network. The output of the 3DCNN is an array of probabilities of five phases. Three metastable structures obtained from different initial noise distributions and the volume fractions of both the A and B segments were used for input. As a result, a total of six probability arrays were summed, and the predicted phase was determined from the maximum probability in the summed array.
4. Results and discussion
Fig. 4 shows the predicted phase diagram of AB diblock copolymers. The results of chain length N = 20 and 40 are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b) by scaling χN. The original phase diagram obtained from intensive SCFT calculation was mostly reproduced, even in the region where no samples were used for training. Fig. 5 shows the predicted phase diagram of AB2 star block copolymers. N is the number of segments of the entire molecule. Since the chain structure of AB2 star block copolymers is not symmetric for the volume fraction, the SCFT also gives unsymmetrical phase diagram. Although the agreement with the original SCFT phase diagram was relatively poor compared with the AB diblock case, asymmetricity was reproduced well, and the boundary was close to that of the original

phase diagram. The results imply that the asymmetricity of the phase diagram can be reproduced by training with a small number of AB2 samples and a large number of diblock samples that show symmetric phase diagrams. Thus, as expected, the 3DCNN training set could account for not only the volume fraction but also structure while classifying the stable phase. Fig. 6 shows the predicted phase diagram of ABA asymmetric triblock copolymers. Asymmetricity τ is an additional parameter and asymmetricity of phase diagram also depend on the parameter. The vertical axis is shown in units of τ, and the results for different χN values are shown in different figures in the style of Fig. 3 in ref. [3]. N is the number of segments of the entire molecule. The predicted phase diagrams reproduce the original SCFT results well. The predicted phase diagram shows a wider disorder phase than seen in the original SCFT results, especially in the case of χN = 20. At χN = 20 and larger τ values, there is a quasi-stable region where nucleation is a driving force for phase separation, and no spinodal decomposition is observed. SCFT calculation from the homogenous state cannot reproduce nucleation
while staying in the homogenous (disordered) state. We examined some metastable structures for which the predicted phases were correct and incorrect. Fig. 7 shows examples of metastable structures of ABA asymmetric triblock copolymers. Although the regions depicted in both Fig. 7(a) and (b) were in the lamellar phase according to precise SCFT calculation, the 3DCNN predicted that the region in Fig. 7 (b) was in the cylinder phase. Observation by human eye would also lead to assigning Fig. 7(b) a cylinder-like structure. Thus, the 3DCNN seems to recognize the structure and classify the stable phase correctly in this case. Fig. 8 shows examples of metastable structures of AB2 star block copolymers. Although Fig. 8(a) is in the sphere phase, and Fig. 8(b) is in the cylinder phase, the predicted results were cylinder phase in both cases. Fig. 8(a) clearly shows a spherical structure. Thus, the 3DCNN could not recognize structure correctly in this case. One possible explanation for this failure is that number of training data for the spherical phase was too small. Further refinement of the deep learning network and quantitative analysis of those structures should be conducted in the future.
5. Conclusion
We conducted a deep learning study to classify the microphaseseparated structures of block copolymers. We applied the 3DCNN architecture to classify 3D phase-separated structure. The metastable structures of sets of polymer structures and χN values were obtained by crude, inexpensive SCFT calculation. The training set information included the correspondence between volume fractions of segment types and structures and the stable phase labels obtained by intensive, rigorous SCFT calculation. The 3DCNN network trained by a limited number of sets of polymer structures and χN values successfully reproduced the phase diagrams of a wide variety of copolymer types: AB diblock, AB2 star, and ABA asymmetric triblock copolymers. Using predicted stable morphology as an initial guess, the precise SCFT can be conducted. This approach will reduce the total computational cost of SCFT to determine the stable morphology by reducing candidates to be considered. This study’s results can be applied to various kinds of polymers, and this technique could enable the prediction of phase diagrams of unknown polymer structures by conducting cost-effective calculations without intensive SCFT calculations. Furthermore, this approach combining crude computational simulation and image recognition by deep learning indicates a potential to be applied in general to accelerate computational simulation for predicting
