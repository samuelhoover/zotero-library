ABSTRACT
With the financial requirements and high time associated with bringing a commercial drug to the market, the application of computer-aided drug design has been recognized as a powerful technology in the drug discovery pipeline. In accelerating drug discovery, molecular modeling techniques have experienced considerable growth in computational capabilities over the last decade. Pharmaceutical companies and academic research organizations are currently using various computational modeling techniques to lower the cost and time required for the discovery of an effective drug. In this article, we focus on reviewing three key components of molecular modeling (Molecular Docking, Molecular Dynamics, and ADMET modeling), their applications, and limitations in small-molecule drug discovery. We discussed the technicalities encircling molecular dynamics and docking, the algorithms used to develop the docking softwares, and the models explored by these algorithms coupled with their scoring functions. We also reviewed the influence of molecular dynamics simulations (all atoms and coarsegrained molecular dynamics simulations) in drug discovery and also elucidated how the ensembles generated from MD simulations could pave the way for novel drug discovery. Furthermore, we briefly explain the role played by pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiling in discovering new leads for therapeutic efficacy. Besides the computational success of molecular modeling in drug discovery, we highlighted the experimental corroboration of in silico discovered drug candidates. However, as there is hardly a drug in the market discovered primarily with the use of computational modeling, we concluded the review by proposing possible solutions that could foster the advancement and clinical success of drugs.
1. Introduction
The search for novel therapeutic candidates has always been an aspect of research that proves to be crucial towards improving the health of man. From the epidemics caused by the influenza virus between the 1800s and 1900s [1] to the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV2 [2], the human populations around the globe have suffered several setbacks and continue to be victimized by these microscopic organisms. In addition, human health has also been constantly challenged by life-threatening diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Hence, drug discovery research continues to be the biggest
challenge facing the scientific community. The challenges faced in the identification, development, and approval of novel chemical entities is not only limited to the complexity of the research but also often time-consuming and expensive. In a statistical report (http://csdd.tufts. edu/news/complete_story/pr_tufts_csdd_2014_cost_study) by the Tufts Centre for the Study of Drug Development (CSDD), it was shown that the total cost of the drug discovery process from start to approval could cost 2.6 billion USD and that the overall drug development pipeline may span an average of approximately 14 years [3]. These challenges highlight the need to develop techniques that could assist in the rapid screening and discovery of lead therapeutic candidates at the lowest

possible cost. One of the techniques that is proving to be the game changer in addressing the obstacles faced by the drug discovery research is Molecular Modeling. Although molecular modeling is a broad field, but molecular docking, MD simulation and ADMET modeling represent three most widely used components of computational modeling and have been crucial in the ease identification of leads for experimental in vitro and in vivo testing [4–6]. While molecular docking-based virtual screening identifies hit compounds with the highest binding affinity [7] and correct binding mode, it is often disadvantaged by the lack or improper simulation of receptor flexibilities. Since proteins are dynamic entities, their conformations play a pivotal role in the biomolecular recognition of ligands, and hence their flexibilities in a simulation environment represent a more accurate delineation of the biological system. Although some docking softwares has been developed to address the flexibilities of proteins, larger percentages of these programs do not factor in full receptor flexibilities. On the other hand, MD simulation is capable of taking on this challenge and determining the time-dependent dynamics of protein-ligand interactions. At an atomistic level, MD simulation treats proteins, ligands, water molecules, and ions as particles interacting with one another through the integration of force-fields derived on the basis of Newton’s classical law of motion. Holistically, MD simulation acts as a molecular microscope that could be used to inspect the stability of ligands in the active pocket of the receptor targets, which is crucial to substantiating the results predicted through the molecular docking-based virtual screening process. While molecular docking and molecular dynamics may determine the efficacy or potency of a drug, ADMET modeling is capable of dictating the clinical success of drugs in clinical trials. Safe drugs exhibit a fine-tuned combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity. The pharmaceutical industry faces a substantial challenge in coordinating the optimization of these related parameters. To that end, massive efforts have been made to create tools that can predict pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics endpoints during hit-to-lead and lead-optimization processes [8]. Despite the fact that loss of efficacy and safety concerns are driving up drug R & D attrition rates, pharmacokinetic features have had less of an impact in the last decade. This decrease is due to improved pharmacokinetic control programs and their early incorporation into the research pipeline. Fully integrated ADMET prediction platforms can easily reject inappropriate compounds by simultaneously targeting numerous pharmacokinetic characteristics, lowering the number of synthesis assessment cycles and scaling down the number of expensive late-stage failures. Right here, we clarify how the atomistic interactions existing between receptors and their prospective drug candidates can be used to estimate the affinity and stability of these drugs in the pocket of their target proteins. Parameters like RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation), RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation), ROG (Radius of Gyration) and Hbond interaction are exploited to estimate the therapeutic efficacy of the prospective drug candidates. In addition, we explained the role of ensembles generated in molecular dynamics simulation in drug discovery, after which we discussed the solvent effect consideration, sampling of conformation, and clustering of receptors, which account for the conformational dynamics of proteins. Furthermore, we discuss the technicalities behind molecular docking, its application in virtual screening, pose prediction, and binding affinity in designing drugs with formidable therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we explained the models used by the various software algorithms and their scoring functions and later mentioned the bottleneck of the force field not considering solvent while binding receptors to their respective ligands. A brief discussion on safety and toxicity estimation with in silico ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) profiling used to clarify the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs was another dimension of this comprehensive review. Our goal is to emphasize the importance of all these techniques in drug discovery and also, to expose
their limitations and, ultimately, to suggest possible ways out of these challenges.
2. Molecular docking
Molecular docking is an in silico method for recognizing the correct binding pose of a protein-ligand complex and evaluating its strength using various scoring functionsfor selecting the best pose generated by each molecule to a rank-order [9]. The docking techniques attempt to fit a ligand into the binding site of a target protein by combining and optimizing variables such as hydrophobic, steric, and electrostatic complementarily and thereby estimating their binding free energy [10]. To correctly carry out the docking process, one requires the high resolution of X-ray crystallographic structures, NMR or homology-modeled structures with a known binding site. There are thousands of experimentally determined 3D-structures of proteins available in the protein data bank (PDB) [11]. X-ray and NMR machines allow scientists to experimentally solve the detailed 3D structures of molecules in their interaction forms, which is an important method in recognizing critical residues, analyzing the strength of interaction forces, their energetics, and understanding how molecular structures fit together. Due to the shortcomings of present experimental techniques, the 3-Dimensional structures of some proteins are often difficult to determine and, hence, are usually not available in the protein data bank (PDB). However, with the development of sophisticated bioinformatics techniques, the 3-dimensional structure of a target protein that is unavailable in the protein data bank could be modeled using homology modeling servers (see Fig. 1). Homology modeling is used to predict the tertiary structure of the target based on a template with similar residue. The theoretical evidence behind this is based on the fact that proteins that share similar residues have similar structures and the same ancestral origin. The Swiss Model Server represents one of the most widely used web-based tools for homology modeling [12]. Other web servers for homology modeling include Phyre [13], i-TASSER [14], HH Pred [15], PSI-Pred [16], Robetta [17], and Raptor [18]. In 2021, the field of computational structural biology has further been boosted with the DeepMind’s highly accurate Alphafold for homology modeling [19]. In this groundbreaking discovery that solved 50 years of grand challenges in protein structure prediction, Jumper and the other great minds at DeepMinds used artificial intelligence (AI) and other powerful machine learning tools to design a model that achieved more than 92% accuracy with 3D-structural protein prediction. Among all the webservers/tools, AlphaFold stands strong and, after being published in Nature, was ranked the best model/software for homology modeling. Interestingly, another model (RoseTTAFold) published on the same day as AlphaFold also achieved high accuracy with protein prediction [20], having a confidence score only bettered by the Deepminds’ model. However, the advantage of Baker’s lab RoseTTAFold over AlphaFold is the ability to predict complex biological assemblies such as protein-protein structures. These newly designed models are believed to revolutionize in silico drug discovery in this 21st century. Molecular docking encompasses three major objectives: virtual screening, pose prediction, and binding affinity estimation [21]. A reliable docking technique must be able to differentiate binding sites from non-binding sites as well as their molecular interactions. In addition, when dealing with large compound libraries, it is expected that the method used must successfully distinguish binding molecules from non-binding and rate the binding molecules among the best compounds in the database [22]. The success of virtual screening is based upon the amount and accuracy of structural information known about the target protein and the ligand being docked. The first step is to assess the target for the presence of relevant binding sites [23,24]. This is usually done through the analysis of known protein-ligand co-crystal structures or using in silico methods to identify novel binding pockets (see Fig. 2) [25].

[29] and PATCH-SURFER [30] detect similar pockets. Other in silico techniques, such as POCKET [31], detect the binding site of a target protein by rolling a "spherical probe", or a pre-computer representation of an idealized ligand, occupying the active pocket of the target protein over the grid surface. Docking-based virtual screening is helpful and most preferred when the binding site of the target biomolecule is known. Hence, a library of ligands that have inhibitory potential against the target protein could then be docked against it. However, in the absence of a known binding site in a target protein, blind docking methods are usually employed [32] (see Fig. 2 for a depiction of the blind docking method). In some cases, studying the mechanism of action of a potential drug or ligand with the structure of a receptor or protein could also instigate the implementation of blind docking. This could expose the agonist or inhibitory activity of the ligand binding either to the active site or inhibitory site of the receptor. Although the methods of blind docking are included as part of most docking programs, they pose some disadvantages as they are time-consuming and have a low success rate in comparison to docking into a known binding pocket.
2.1. Docking Algorithm
2.1.1. Search function
A search algorithm involves producing an optimum number of protein-ligand geometries, including the experimentally determined
binding pose [33]. After the generation of these binding poses, they are usually assessed with a scoring algorithm that differentiates the binding pose of the experimentally determined one from the other binding mode predicted by the search algorithm. The docking program that employs a search function can be classified into three main groups with respect to the methodology that is used for examining ligand flexibility; deterministic, systemic, and stochastic searches [34]. Three major techniques are employed by docking methods according to ligand and protein flexibility; (1) the protein is partially or totally regarded as flexible and all the ligand’s torsional degrees of freedom (TORSDOF) are examined, (2) the protein is regarded as a rigid entity while the ligand’s torsional degrees of freedom (TORSDOF) are investigated (i.e. conformational, translational, and rotational), (3) the protein is seen as a rigid entity with no torsional degree of freedom of ligands [35]. Table 1 consists of docking algorithms used by various docking software and the mode of treating proteins with regard to flexibility. The docking program that employs search function can be divided into two major classes based on molecular flexibility of ligand and/or protein docking function: Rigid body and Flexible docking. Docking software programs that employ the rigid body method often ignore the flexibilities of ligands and proteins, which can reduce the precision and accuracy of their results. However, there is still some certainty that the docked ligand-protein complexes recapitulate the biophysical pose and mode of interactions as observed with their corresponding co-crystallized complexes [36–38].

Conversely, the flexible docking procedure enhances the selection of various conformations of the ligand and/or the target protein, but it is computationally expensive.
2.1.1.1. Ligand flexibility. The search algorithm could be divided into four based on ligand flexibility, which include; shape matching [72], systematic method, stochastic or random methods, and simulation method. The shape matching method inserts the ligand into the active site of the protein using the principle of 3D-complementarity, which states that the protein-ligand binding surface must complement each
other. The search algorithm allows structural degrees of freedom of the ligand, enabling it to generate various conformations in the binding site of the protein. Hence, the primary aim of the shape-matching method is to ensure good shape complementarity between the ligand and the binding site of the protein. The docking programs that employ the shape matching algorithm employ the following: ZDOCK [39], FRED [40], FLOG [42], surflex [41], ligand fit [44] and EUDOC [43]. Systematic algorithm involves searching for all the possible structural degrees of freedom in a molecule, eventually leading to the combinatorial explosion challenge [73]. As a result, it is important to divide the ligands into separate portions before being progressively

docked into the active site of the target protein. Notably, programs that adopt this approach are DOCK [45] and FLEX [46]. In the stochastic method, the configuration of the ligand is sampled by making random changes to the ligand in both the conformational space and structural degrees of freedom [74] and deciding whether to accept or reject the change according to the probabilistic criterion. This method significantly reduces the computational effort for larger systems. However, the major disadvantage is the uncertainty of convergence. Examples of stochastic algorithms include Monte Carlo methods used in MCDOCK [47]. This approach ensures that the ligand or small molecule of interest is modified computationally using both translation and rotation of the entire small molecule. In order to get a particular conformation, in most cases, more than one parameter can be used and changed at a time according to one’s interest. The resulting conformation is then investigated at the binding site of a target protein based on the energy calculation using molecular mechanics (MM). The MM could either be accepted or rejected for the following iterations based on the Boltzmann’s probability constant. The rejection or acceptance of the generated conformation is a function of the change in energy with respect to temperature (simulated annealing) [75]. This criterion makes the MC technique exceptional compared to others. Considering the Tabu search, which is an offshoot of the MC technique, the search space of the binding site of a target protein is maintained and also ensures that the site is exposed to its maximum [76]. Aside from MCDOCK, the Monte Carlo method has also been used in programs like FDS [48], AUTODOCK [49], PRODOCK [50], DockVina 1.0.3 [51], ICM [52], GlamDock [53], YUCCA [54], ROSETTALIGAND [55], to mention a few. One of the major limitations of the MC technique is the uncertainty of convergence. Though this can be corrected or mediated by performing several independent runs [75]. Another useful algorithm is the genetic (evolutionary) algorithm implemented in GOLD 3.1 [56] and AUTODOCK 4.0 [57]. The genetic algorithm (GA) is similar to the MC method in that it is mostly used to locate the global minima. This method is greatly influenced by Darwin’s Theory of Evolution [77]. GA maintains a library of ligands with an accompanying fitness, which is ascertained by the scoring function approach. Each of the ligands in the library represents a potential hit. It has also been established that GA alters the conformation of the ligands in the library either by mutation or crossover [75]. In the first stage, accessing and selecting the most suitable ligands from the collection is established. The effect of mutation is to design new ligands from a template ligand by changing a fragment in its conformation randomly, while the crossover approach exchanges necessary information between two or more members of the library [78]. GA has also been employed in programs like DARWIN [58], FLIPDock [59], DIVALI [60], PSI-DOCK [61], GAMBLER [62], and FITTED [63]. The limitation of this algorithm is similar to that of the MC algorithm in which the uncertainty of convergence is a major disadvantage [75]. Incremental construction (IC) is another algorithm which has been employed for fishing out valuable conformations from fruitless ones. Here, the rotatable bonds of the ligand are subjected to fragmentation. One of the fragments generated after fragmentation is held tightly to the receptor surface, forming a complex. This part of the fragment forming complex with the receptor is generally considered to have the maximum interactions with the receptor surface, and also tend to exhibit a minimum number of alternate conformations showing a fairly rigid ring system. Once the complex has been fully established, the fragments are then added, step wisely. Fragments that have a greater potential for showing interactions like hydrogen bonding are usually added first since they are responsible for the specificity of the ligand and are directional in nature [75]. Additionally, hydrogen bonds are known to contribute greatly to the accuracy of geometry prediction. Once a fragment is added, the poses with the least energy are taken into account for the next iteration, making the algorithm ultimately fast and vigorous [46]. IC has been incorporated into programs like FLOG [42], Hammerhead [64], DOCK 4.0 [65], SLIDE [66], eHiTs [67], FlexX [46], ProPose [68], MacDock [69], etc.

One of the limitations of this algorithm is that fragments generated by large size ligands pose a problem and tends to be infeasible, thus it is only restricted to medium size ligands [75]. The most common computational technique for simulation algorithms presently is molecular dynamics. However, the disadvantage of molecular dynamics as a simulation technique is its inability to cross high-energy barriers within feasible simulation time periods, and hence it may only place ligands in local minima of the energy surface [34]. Therefore, it is important to simulate various parts of a protein-ligand system at different temperatures [79]. Another method of addressing the local minima challenge is starting molecular dynamics calculations from different ligand positions. In contrast to molecular dynamics, minimization of energy is barely used as a stand-alone search method, as only local energy minima can be reached, but usually complements other search methods, including Monte Carlo.
2.1.1.2. Protein flexibility. Proteins are dynamic and flexible structures, and the major goal of molecular docking is that the protein should be treated as a flexible entity during the docking process [35,80,81]. There are two models of molecular recognition that are applicable to protein flexibility; induced-fit and conformational selection. According to the induced-fit model, when a ligand binds to a protein, the protein often experiences a conformational rearrangement. These molecular changes in the protein conformation produce a protein-ligand complex with tighter binding. The conformational selection model is based on the fact that protein exists as an ensemble of conformations in solution and molecular dynamics, and NMR can be used to generate these structures experimentally. An example of this preparation is the relaxed complex scheme that produces various protein conformations for docking [82]. In the conformational selection model, small molecules select from the ensemble of protein conformations that to which they bind the strongest [83]. These two models have been used to provide protein-ligand docking techniques. The induced-fit has been used to explain how complementarity is achieved with conformational selection, describing the conformational complexity of proteins. Hence, it is worthy of note that the induced-fit and conformational selection are not contradictory but instead each concentrate on a specific aspect of the intermolecular recognition process. "Selective docking" methods which justify local flexibility have usually been referring to the induced fit model and the "ensemble docking methods which is based on an ensemble of rigidprotein conformations, could clearly be related to the model of conformational selection. An example of a program which has been used for the induced-fit model is Schrodinger’s Glide induced-fit docking (IFD) [70], while OEDocking v 3.0.0 with its HYBRID program has been used to address the ensemble of protein conformational model [71].
2.1.2. Scoring function
Scoring functions is an algorithm designed to compute the binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex [84]. When a ligand binds to its target receptor, the binding pose that most accurately describes the actual structure of the protein-ligand complex is predicted by the scoring function. Conversely, if some sets of ligands are to be computed, the scoring function should not only recognize the actual configuration and orientation but also be able to rank one ligand with respect to another. Hence, it is of basic importance that the scoring function be designed in a way in which it can rank various poses of protein-ligand complex [85]. The binding energy of a protein-ligand complex using a number of assumptions and simplifications to arrive as close as possible to the correct binding energy in the minimum time can be evaluated using a scoring function. There are three types of scoring functions that are used presently; force-field, empirical, and knowledge-based scoring functions. The force field scoring functions have been developed on the basis of physical interactions like vanderwaals interactions, electrostatic
interactions, and the bond length, bond angle, and bond torsions [86]. All these parameters are usually derived from experimental and ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The challenge encountered with the force-field function is how solvents are treated during ligand binding [74]. Various force-field scoring functions are based on different force-field parameters. For example, the AMBER force-field [87] parameter is used for Autodock and the Tripos force-field for G-score [88]. The DOCK [89] program is one of the common programs that makes use of the force-field scoring function algorithm for computing protein-ligand interactions. One major challenge of the force-field function is that it does not put into consideration an essential solvent effect that charged groups favor aqueous environments whereas non-polar groups tend to stay in non-aqueous environments, commonly known as the de-solvation effect. Another problem with the force-field scoring function is how to predict accurately the entropic effect, which poses a more challenging problem than the de-solvation effect. These challenges could actually limit the resultant interactions of the protein-ligand docking system due to the fact that columbic interactions are only favorable for ligands with the highest charges. In order to have a meaningful docking interaction, one needs to take the effect of water on the complex before and after the complex formation into consideration, as well as the process by which the complex is mediated by the effect of water. Some groups of scientists reviewed and enhanced the existing function by employing the effect of solvent on protein-ligand interactions using solvent models indirectly [90]. DelPhi [91] and HYDREN [92] were used for determining and calculating the electrostatic interactions, a precomputed receptor potential, and the ligand desolvation penalties, respectively. The Lennard-Jones potential and the Poisson-Boltzmann approach were employed for calculating the van Der Waals interactions and modeling the protein’s electrostatic potentials, respectively. In empirical scoring functions, the binding energy score of a proteinligand complex is evaluated by adding up a set of weighted empirical energy terms which induce VDW energy, hydrogen bonding energy, electrostatic energy, entropy term, desolvation term, hydrophobicity term, etc. ΔG = ΣiWi⋅ΔGi where "ΔGi" stands for individual empirical energy terms, and the corresponding coefficients "Wi" are computed by generating the binding affinity data of a training set of protein-ligand complexes with identified three-dimensional structures with the use of least square fittings [93, 94]. In comparison with other scoring functions, the empirical scoring functions are usually much more computationally productive due to their simple energy terms. A number of empirical scoring functions have been developed, such as SCORE2 [95], Chem Score [96], Rank Score [97], Lig Score [98], Glide Score [70], HINT [99], etc. Knowledge based scoring functions are obtained from structural information of protein-ligand complexes determined by experimental methods [100,101]. The scoring functions are based on the principle of the potential mean force (PMF), where the energy of the complex is the sum of all the interaction terms of the protein-ligand atom pairs [74]. An important component of knowledge-based scoring functions is the introduction of an appropriate reference state for an optimal description of the residue-residue or atom-atom pairs in the non-interaction state. One significant advantage of many knowledge-based scoring functions is their computational simplicity, which enhances efficient screening of large compound databases. A drawback is that their derivation is fundamentally based on information implicitly encoded in limited sets of the target-ligand complex. Some common knowledge-based functions include DrugScore [102], PMF [103], MScore [104], SMoG [105], BLEEP [106] and ITScore/SE [74].

The use of molecular dynamics simulation (MD) has created a paradigm in drug discovery for decades. Generally, simulation helps

predict the movement of atoms in a molecular system in a timely and related manner using physics-dependent intermolecular interaction. Capturing the motion and position of every atom in a bio-molecular system gives useful information. This daunting task in the wet lab, however, comes with ease in simulation, thus reducing the complexity surrounding the wet assays within the shortest time frame [107,108]. This potential has led to the perception of MD as a computational microscope. Molecular dynamics simulation could also help unfolds the mystery encircling the diseases associated with protein misfolding and aggregation and therefore help identify small molecular modulator [109,110]. Recently, it was reported that MD simulation could be used to target drugs used for the treatment or management of neurological disorders [4,111,112]. The information provided by MD in drug discovery varies widely, from hit identification to drug design. Structure based drug discovery is characterized by the use of molecular targets, most especially proteins, which are as a result of experimental work from X-ray crystallography, NMR or homology modeling and are obtained from databases like the Protein Databank, AlphaFold protein structure database, etc., to screen a large library of ligands for the identification of hit compounds in docking studies [19, 113,114]. However, one of the limitations here is that the protein target conformation retrieved from the database only favors the protein crystallization process and may not depict the biochemically relevant conformation of the protein; this is thus potentiated to increase the number of false positives in virtual screening. While employing the static structure in virtual screening underscores enrichment factor, the flexibility in protein structure has been campaigned to improve virtual screening and reduce false positives in early stage of drug discovery [115–117]. Several methods, most notably molecular dynamics simulation, have been suggested to factor in protein flexibility. MD has been reported to generate different structural conformations deposited in the database that are in the form of X-ray crystals, NMR, and cryo-EM and are subsequently subjected to ensemble docking. This motivation by MD does not only improve the virtual screening process but also identifies other druggable sites on the structure and fosters hit identification. This is justified in the following studies [118,119]. A 2013 study published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling tailored towards the identification of novel aldose reductase inhibitors (ARI) used MD in its approach. Aldose Reductase, an enzyme that is implicated in diabetes, converts glucose to sorbitol under hyperglycemic condition. This enzyme’s active site architecture samples different conformations when different ligands are bound to it, such that when ligand A binds, the residues it makes interactions with are diametrically different from those of ligand B and C; this causes difficulty in the identification of a particular binding site to be used for this enzyme. A short MD simulation of this protein target (aldose reductase) gave three average conformations that were subsequently used to dock a wide array of compounds. The lead compound and the target protein interaction were later evaluated using MD (complex dynamics). Preclinical and clinical trials of this lead compound revealed it to have high biological activity and a reduced off-target effect compared to Epalrestat, which has been marketed [120]. Sometimes protein targets obtained from the data repositories do not give full active site information. Evidence for this was recent research that involved a 500ns MD simulation that revealed binding site information not found in the PDB retrieved crystal structure of renin, which is an attractive target for anti-hypertensive drugs in the Renin-Angiotensin-system [117]. It also generated ensembles of carboxylesterase-1 structures for docking and machine learning techniques for the discovery of therapeutic agents with inhibitory ability against this protein target [121]. One of the problems associated with the use of MD in the generation of ensembles of structures is the long-time production run for classical all-atom MD. One method used to overcome this hurdle is biased MD—an approach that applies a potential or force to the system under consideration, thereby decreasing the delay in local minima. This was investigated by Campbell and colleagues in a study that involved Cyclin
Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) and factor Xa [122]. Conformations of structures obtained from MD simulation performed better than individual crystal structures and other ensemble generation methods in terms of enrichment factor, although identification of the conformations with optimum performance is still a mist because a large number of conformations are generated in MD. The search for allosteric modulators of Adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR) - a classical GPCR receptor that has been implicated as a therapeutic target for treating cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injuries is in the pipeline. A study used Gaussian accelerated MD to deliver different protein conformations of the A1AR protein obtained from the PDB Cryo-EM structure for docking. The results claimed ensembles generated from MD performed better than individual cryo-EM structures [123]. However, several methods have been employed to deliver ensembles of structure for virtual screening. Part of these has just been reviewed briefly, and others include the work of Ogrizek and co-workers on cathepsin B [124]. Tian and colleagues also used MD to identify potential inhibitors for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) [125]. GPCRs have been identified to have multiple small-molecule binding pockets. Falcon and colleagues used MD to identify druggable MD conformers of membrane GPCR structures retrieved from the PDB [126]. Another group of researchers from the Philippines reviewed MD applications in tuberculosis and concluded that MD has indeed sped up the rate of drug discovery for this disease [127]. Meanwhile, those that are not MD dependent have been proven in other papers [128–130]. This suggests that the utility of ensembles of structure to champion protein flexibility is key in computer-aided drug design. Therefore, it is fascinating to know that ensembles generated from MD outperform others. The interaction of a ligand with a protein seen in docking does not guarantee the stability of the ligand in the binding pocket of proteins because molecular docking studies only give binding energy information and the orientation of the ligand in the pocket. Moreover, molecular docking software algorithms have not been written to incorporate active site water molecules and protein flexibilities, which could contribute significantly to the binding energy of a protein-ligand complex. Unlike docking simulation, molecular dynamics considers the solvent effects, sampling conformation, and clustering of the receptor, which could account for the conformational dynamics of the protein. Hence, an investigator could evaluate better the stability of a drug candidate in the binding pocket of an enzyme by simulating the binary complex of a docked protein-ligand in a more realistic MD environment where the induced fit theory and solvent effect are largely applicable. Meanwhile, the higher the binding affinity in docking, the more likely the ligand will become a lead compound. Although this is still subject to drug-like predictions like ADME profiling. Subjecting the best docked complex to MD simulation gives more information about the interaction, and this has been validated in various studies. Trajectories of results generated after simulation can be subjected to a wide range of analysis depending on the aim of the user. But a detailed analysis of simulation trajectories is the gateway to understanding parameters that are important for strong and stable interaction. Common analyses computed after simulation include the Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (ROG), and H-bond, to mention a few (see Fig. 3 for graph spectrums). These analyses are used to evaluate the protein-ligand complex stability during the simulation period and are relevant to evaluating their functional reliability in a living system, culminating in the efficacy of the drug, which is key in drug discovery. While RMSD measures stability, RMSF evaluates the flexibility of residues in the protein, and those at the active site are of interest in drug discovery. No observable structural shifts in the RMSD spectrum suggest that the complex is stable. ROG addresses the compactness of the complex, and H-bond analysis examines the degree of interaction between the ligand and the protein, and the ability of the complex to maintain the H-bond interaction seen in docking throughout the MD simulation signifies stability. The higher the H-bond in the

complex and the more it is able to maintain it throughout the ligandprotein dynamics simulation, the better the interaction and the more likely the ligand will modulate its target [131–134]. After virtual screening of bioactive compounds from 10 plants in a study designed to find potential inhibitors for HMG-CoA reductase – the
rate limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, Rutin emerged, and the stability of the Rutin-HMG-CoA reductase complex was evaluated with MD. A critical look at the RMSD, RMSF, ROG, and H-bond spectrum of the complex showed that it was stable compared to the free apoprotein [135]. Another study from a group in china, who were the first group to

employ in silico study for the search of novel anesthetic compounds, this group targeted γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor – a common anesthetic target, complementary information from MD analysis (RMSD) reassured the lead 5 ligand as a potent GABA receptor inhibitor and should be channeled to the pre-clinical stage of the drug discovery process [136]. Londhe and colleagues investigated the atomistic details of Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors by subjecting four protein-ligand complexes (4L7B_1VV, 5CGJ_51 M, 4XMB_41P, and 5FNU_L61) to MD simulation and the Umbrella sampling technique, where the first four words are the protein PDB code and the three other words are ligand code in all cases. RMSD analysis computed after 50 ns of MD simulation revealed that other ligands were stable in the kelch domain of Keap1 throughout the simulation except for ligand 1VV. The instability of the 1VV ligand was attributed to the fluctuation seen around the 15ns time frame of the RMSD spectrum; this suggested that the ligand flipped and sampled various conformations while undergoing the simulation. This simple information obtained from the RMSD analysis of this MD could motivate the parameters that should be taken into consideration for the discovery of novel Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein inhibitors in future studies and could not be obtained in conventional binding assays [137]. Amino acids on proteins that mediate interaction with ligands in complex dynamics contain crucial residues that can be exploited in the design of novel inhibitors for protein targets [137,138]. The protein-ligand interaction is key in the drug design mainstream process and the low cost associated with MD simulation compared to its experimental counterpart reduces the cost and time associated [139]. MD cannot only give stability clue but can also give energetic information by incorporating trajectories simulation with either MMPBSA or MM-GBSA to calculate binding free energy which is the affinity of the ligand for the target, although free energy can be calculated by other computational methods, the one obtained from MD have been proven to reduce false positives and exhibit high performance [140–142]. Binding free energy evaluation is relevant in drug discovery processes because the ability of a ligand to elicit a therapeutic effect is dependent on the degree of binding to the target. The umbrella sampling technique has also evolved as a reliable MD tool for computing the affinity of protein-ligand complexes. The binding affinity is evaluated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of free energy change, determined by using the potential of mean force (PMF). The studies of Lan and co-authors on Alzheimer’s disease and Acetyl-cholinesterase (AchE) inhibitors are examples that show the importance of umbrella sampling in drug discovery [143]. In their in silico investigation, 5-carboxy-2′-deoxyuridine was found to be a potent drug candidate against AchE, and the binding energy of the compound ( 11.38 kcal/mol) estimated with PMF was consistent with the experimental binding affinity. An important parameter that is optimized in drug discovery is permeability. The ability of a drug to permeate membranes is critical for drugs with intracellular targets because their efficacy depends on their bioavailability. Several methods, such as parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) and immobilized artificial membrane (IAM), are already in place to obtain the ability of a potential drug candidate to permeate membranes [144,145]. Instead of subscribing to these time-consuming in vitro methods, molecular dynamics simulation can be used to obtain the permeability profile of a compound without its synthesis, thus reducing cost and energy. In a study juxtaposing the permeation predictive ability of MD and the popular PAMPA technique, a group from the USA using specific calibration datasets concluded that results obtained from their all-atom MD simulation were consistent with the in vitro PAMPA data [146]. Recently, an article published by Nature Communications described how the permeation of a drug candidate can be evaluated using martini force field coarse-grained MD—an approach poised to lower the long-time frame that could have been invested in all atomistic MD by pooling atoms together into super-particles or beads [147]. Again, molecular dynamics simulation helps in the lead optimization
process. Following the lead identification stage—the stage before preclinical trial in the drug discovery scheme—scientists always impute an intention to deliver a drug with high potencies into the clinics. This may, however, call for the optimization of the lead compound at the active site of the target to bring about a more therapeutic effect [148]. The addition of a group or removal of another in a ligand and understanding its subsequent interaction in the active pocket of the target is a dynamic process; MD has been used to corroborate this claim [149–151]. It is now crystal clear that molecular dynamics simulation utility in drug discovery spans from early drug discovery steps to lead optimization. Despite this intriguing property addressed by this technology, it still suffers some setbacks. To obtain reliable information from simulations, the simulation time has to be sufficiently long. Simulation around the microseconds and milliseconds time scale brings simulation closer to experimental conditions and gives reliable results. Although this is not applicable to the evaluation of protein-ligand interactions, a few nanoseconds of simulation is sufficient for the analysis [152,153]. Information of biochemical interest occurs at the nanosecond, millisecond or more time scale in reality, but MD simulation could take billions of time steps to show this information, causing the production MD to run for months. Infarct, the saying in the simulation world is that the larger the system, the longer the run, and this is true for a complex dynamic that incorporates atoms from both the ligand and receptor protein. Two methods have been identified to address the longtime scale limitation posed by MD simulation, and these include; improving the computer hardware specification and leap-frog integrator time step. A special purpose machine called ANTON has been designed to tackle the setback encountered with molecular dynamic simulation time length. However, this supercomputer with high computing power is not afforded by most scientists [154]. Other supercomputers with special-purpose hardware such as MDGRAPE [155], MD Engine [156] and FASTRUN [157] have been designed to speed up the most expensive computational systems for MD simulation. In recent time, computer system with powerful Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) has been introduced to allow run MD simulation at a minimal cost [158]. Another method employed to alleviate the computationally expensive MD simulation is to build a model system that involves increasing the leap-frog integrator time steps. The time step of all-atom molecular dynamic simulations is largely dictated by the fastest motions in the system and is technically fixed at 2 fs. The use of coarse-grained (CG) dynamics, where 3-5 heavy atoms are mapped in a bead, involves simulating a system with a much-increased time step [159]. The CG model, where molecules are simulated in the form of pseudo-atoms, enables a reduction in the random degree of freedom, which permits larger systems in a molecular dynamics environment to be studied in a very short time. This model has been used to simulate specific macromolecular systems involving proteins [160] and lipid membranes [161]. Although CG modeling has been largely applied in the study of protein-protein interactions and lipid membrane systems, there have been active fields of computational research solely dedicated to specific protein interactions with DNA [162,163], RNA [164], and other ligands [165]. The application of CG modeling of proteins with small-molecule drugs has, however, posed a challenging task as it requires a fine level of coarse graining and competent force fields [165, 166]. However, an article published recently by Nature Communications suggests that the use of an improved parametrized Martini force field could achieve higher accuracy results compared to all-atom molecular dynamics when simulating protein-small molecule inhibitors with CG modeling [167]. Their benchmark research, which they simulated with GROMACS version 2018, could pave the way for high-throughput screening of drug candidates using the Martini coarse-grained model. Another, increasingly popular approach that has been tested for accelerating MD simulation by increasing the leap-frog integrator time step is Hydrogen Mass Repartitioning (HMR). By increasing the mass of hydrogen atoms to ~3 amu and simultaneously decreasing the parent atom mass by an equal amount, an investigator

could accelerate MD simulation through programming the leap-frog integrator time step from 2 fs to 4 fs using HMR [168]. In drug discovery, small molecule interactions in the binding pocket of membrane proteins are of pharmacological interest, and the application of HMR can be pivotal in accelerating the discovery of potential drug candidates using membrane dynamics. Several studies have been conducted to restrict the movement of hydrogen atoms by increasing their mass in a membrane-biomolecular system for the purpose of speeding up MD simulation [169–171]. Since the emergence of the HMR technology, it has been used with software packages such as AMBER [172], NAMD [173], and ACEMD [174]. The establishment of accurate force fields is also a major stumbling block in MD simulation. Classical force fields are known to determine the accuracy of simulation, and the criteria for evaluating competent force fields are based on their ability to reproduce experimentally known structures. In recent time, several efforts have been applied by force field developers in the re-parametization of consistent force field to simulate macromolecular systems [175–177]. These studies suggest that the improved version of force fields is not perfect but could provide an accurate delineation of various structural and dynamical properties of receptor proteins. Finally, the use of enhanced sampling techniques is another evolving field, although they are associated with a loss in accuracy [178]. Several methods have been introduced to tackle this problem for the improvement of conformational sampling of biomolecules [179–182].
4. Admet and drug-likeness of small molecules
The therapeutic effect of a successful drug is not only dependent on its biological activity but also on a proper ADMET profile. Despite the fact that several ADMET screening methods are available for in vitro and in vivo studies in the laboratory, it is still very important that the pharmacokinetic activity of these therapeutic drugs is performed using an in silico method. In fact, the ability to predict the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs using a computational approach is pivotal in assisting early ADMET investigations [183,184] and reducing the number of animal tests in the laboratory [185]. For a chemically active molecule to be considered as a drug candidate, it must follow some set of parameters that are defined by these pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, it is of great importance in drug discovery that the ADMET properties of a potential drug be determined after its potential to bind to a target receptor have been predicted and shown by in silico molecular docking method. These preclinical candidates must have the tendency to be absorbed into the target surface, be well distributed from the site of insertion to its target site, be properly metabolized in the liver, be eliminated after activity through the excretory system, and must not be toxic [186]. Furthermore, it is imperative that the potential drug candidates obey the Lipinski rule of five (RO5) for excellent drug-likeness and absorption [187]. The physicochemical properties on which Christopher Lipinski based his drug-likeness include the number of H-bond donors (must be ≤ 5) and acceptors (must be ≤ 10), molecular weight (not more than 500 Da) and partition coefficient given by logp (must be ≤ 5). Ligands, phytochemicals, or bioactive compounds (natural or synthetic) that violate more than one of these rules are considered to have poor absorption. A number of software programs have been developed to predict the ADMET properties of drug candidates. For example, QIKprop software has been designed to predict ADMET related properties such as solubility, membrane, coefficients, partition, plasma protein binding, blood brain barrier penetration, and the formation of metabolites [188]. Other softwares for ADMET prediction include; OSIRIS [189], Metasite [190]. Similarly, webservers such as SwissADME [191], ADMETlab [192] and admetSAR [193] are the most popularly used computational tools for the prediction of ADMET properties of drug candidates in pharmaceutical, industrial, and academic settings. Molinspiration (https:// molinspiration.com/)and admetsar 2.0 (https://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/a
dmetsar2/) are few of the known online programs for the physiochemical property determination of compounds. There is no doubt about the importance of early-stage prediction of ADMET and drug-like properties of ligands using these in silico software and webservers. However, question marks surround two major things when screening compounds based on their pharmacokinetics and drug-like profile. First is the decision of investigators to filter out potent drug candidates as a result of their unfavorable ADMET and drug-likeness. In an effort to select ligands with excellent pharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters, it is possible that lead candidates are lost during the screening process. For example, acarbose is a standard, clinically approved drug that is widely used in the treatment of diabetes. The anti-diabetic drug is predicted by the admetsar 2.0 webserver [193] to be hepatotoxic, Ames mutagenic, orally toxic and an inhibitor of human ether-a-go-go (http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2/result/?tid =475139). Moreover, the drug does not comply with Lipinski’s drug-likeness as it violates three out of four parameters in the rule of five. An in silico researcher in effort to select compounds based on excellent ADMET and drug-like profile may filter out acarbose (suppose it has not yet been discovered as efficient anti-diabetic drug) and hence a promising lead-like compound that could be used in the management of type 2 DM could have been lost due to his selection criteria. Even though it is rational to filter out hit compounds (on the basis of binding affinity) with poor ADMET profiles, there are two reasons why an investigator should hold out for more considerations. Firstly, the hit compounds’ drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics may be improved in the lead optimization process [194,195]. Secondly, if the potential therapeutic candidate has a comparatively better pharmacokinetics and toxicological profile than the standard clinically available drugs, then the investigator should avoid dismissing the compound as it might be used as a better alternative after passing through the preclinical and clinical trials. Another concern when screening the ADMET profile of hit compounds is the accuracy of the webservers in predicting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug candidates. Although the perception in the scientific community is that in silico research is purely based on prediction, how much could researchers depend on in silico tools for accurate determination of their research end point? Are we to declare success in the outcome of our findings and go home without proper validation of the in silico prediction tools? It is worthy of note that apart from Acarbose (which has been mentioned earlier), there are also some examples of clinically approved drugs (Chloroquine, Lopinavir, Amodiaquine, etc) that have been predicted by Ametsar2 to be hepatotoxic, mutagenic, and inhibitors of hERG [193]. This is highly perturbing to the inquisitive mind who would have questioned the model on which the webserver was built because the aforementioned drugs have already achieved clinical success with a low safety profile. Although, in recent times, there have been some advances in the ADMET models integrated into webservers and softwares. Nonetheless, for better predictability and accuracy, more effort is still needed to improve the in vitro and in vivo datasets that are used to build these computational models [196]. This concern with the accuracy of ADMET webservers and software predictions was closely examined by Kar and Leszczynski in 2020. The proposition of Kar and his colleague is that to avoid false positive and false negative pharmacokinetic and toxicological predictions, the use of various in silico tools by comparing their results is critically important. Moreover, since different computational ADMET tools are built with different models and algorithms, the outcome of the predictions should be compared for the identification of the most consistent research end point [197].
5. Success of molecular modeling in drug discovery
In the earlier sections of this review, we have discussed two major concepts in molecular modeling (molecular docking and MD simulation), which a beginner in the bioinformatics/computational biology field may find very useful. However, how have these components of

molecular simulation contributed to the discovery of drugs? In this section, we will review the importance and success of molecular modeling in drug discovery. Molecular modeling is a viable tool that could accelerate the discovery of novel chemical entities for the treatment or management of diseases. In the computational modeling community, several in silicobased studies have been reported where small molecule hits were identified to inhibit the activity of their target receptors [198–202]. In fact, some investigations, such as Acharya and co-workers’ recent supercomputer-based ensemble docking and replica-exchange molecular dynamics studies leading to the discovery of 77 drug candidates for the management of COVID-19, have received broad coverage [203]. Nonetheless, it would be misleading to conclude that chemical entities discovered on the basis of only computational modeling have achieved success without robust experimental and clinical validation of the computationally discovered drugs. To this end, we direct our attention towards comprehensive studies that are focused on using experimental techniques to substantiate the discovery of in silico lead candidates. Next, we also review studies where molecular modeling is used to support experimentally generated drug candidates.
5.1. Experimental validation of computationally discovered drugs candidates
Molecular modeling screenings have emerged as a powerful and common practice to explore molecular targets for lead discovery. In support of this claim, a growing number of publications that involve the use of experimental findings to validate the computationally discovered drugs have been reported (Table 2 represents examples of these studies). We briefly review some of the compelling examples of these studies below that have attracted high interest. One compelling example of an experimentally validated in silico generated hit could be found in the recent work of Jin et al. published in Nature [5]. These scientists discovered a mechanism-based peptidomimetic inhibitor (N3) using computer-aided drug design. During the investigations that led to this discovery, the 3-D tertiary structure of SARS-COV2 Mpro was modeled by homology modeling, and Glide software was used as the docking tool to see whether N3 could target this receptor. The resulting in silico experiment revealed that the chemical entity could fit into the substrate binding pocket of the targeted receptor. In order to assess the efficacy of this inhibitor, an experimental kinetic assay was performed, and the outcome of this bioassay showed that the Michael-acceptor compound is a time-dependent irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme. The researchers then went to further elucidate the
crystal structure of Mpro co-crystallized with the small molecule inhibitor (PDB ID: 6LU7). Another study published in the highly reputable Nature involves the computational docking of 3 million small molecule compounds with μOR crystal structure [4]. This virtual screening campaign led to the discovery of a novel agonist (PZM21) of μOR receptor target which could be more efficacious than morphine in the treatment of pain. The docked complex of PZM21-μOR was further subjected to a 3 μs molecular dynamic simulation to investigate the stability of this receptor-bound structure. It was discovered that the key ionic and hydrogen bond interactions responsible for the stability of this complex were maintained throughout the simulation. Moreover, Manglik and his collaborators then synthesized an irreversible version of PZM21 (PZM29), and it was experimentally substantiated that the opioid compound is a potent agonist of μOR. The use of covalent-based docking has been proposed by London et al. as a viable approach that may have broad utility for the rapid discovery of ligand inhibitors [204]. These authors embarked on a virtual screening campaign that led to the discovery of 15 covalent JAK3 (28–42) inhibitors. In order to assess the efficacy and selectivity in vitro, the full dose-response curves of the best docked compounds (Cyanocrylamides 31 and 33) were measured against JAK3 and three other JAK-family kinases (lacking Cys909 residue). Interestingly, the two chemical probes inhibited only the JAK3 enzyme, with an IC50 of 49 nM and 93 nM respectively. The two covalent inhibitors did not have in vitro inhibitory potency against the three other kinases suggesting that covalent interaction of the chemical probes with cysteine residue is crucial for their inhibitory prowess. In another important study, the use of structure-based docking and molecular dynamic simulations led to the discovery of TMPRSS2 inhibitors (Nafamostat, Camostat, and Gabexate) [6]. Subsequently, pharmacophore-based modeling was used to screen a library of compounds to generate compounds with the same active features as Nafamostat, Camostat, and Gabexate. After this screening process, a total of 20,000 lead-like pharmacophoric compounds were identified and subjected to specific docking to the TMPRSS2 active site. Furthermore, 350 hits were selected as the best compounds based on their 1) binding pose. 2) evaluated binding affinity 3) promiscuity and 4) intermolecular H-bond with the target receptor. The authors’ insilico research was then followed by a series of different biochemical assays to test the inhibitory activities of these hit compounds. Finally, four compounds (Otamixaban, NCG00386945, NCG00421880, and UK-1) were experimentally proposed as effective inhibitors of TMPRSS2.

5.2. Computational analysis of experimentally discovered drug candidates
The implementation of computational modeling techniques is also applicable in the inspection of molecular mechanisms of drugs discovered through wet lab experiments and hence has been recognized as an important tool that provides molecular and atomistic details of binding modes, interactions, and inhibition. Although we have provided examples of the summary of our findings in Table 3, below we briefly review some of the retrospective studies gathered based on the context of this section. The study of Tripathi et al. is an interesting topic where in silico molecular modeling was coupled with series of experimental assays to elucidate the binding mechanism and efficacy of teicoplanin with SARSCoV-2 main protease [216]. In search of an effective drug-like inhibitor against 3CLpro, several clinically approved drugs were repurposed against the target enzyme. The authors’ experimental findings point to the fact that teicoplanin is the most effective inhibitor of the tested clinically approved drugs, and their analysis of molecular docking showed that the lead compound fits perfectly into the active site of the receptor by binding to His41 and Cys145 catalytic dyad of Mpro. Moreover, the scoring function of the docking software used reveals a strong binding energy of almost 8.0 kcal/mol, validating the potency of the drug-like compound discovered through wet laboratory assays. In another study, Wan and his colleagues provided insight into the binding mechanism and inhibitory potential of phloroglucinol against α-glucosidase enzyme through the integration of synergistic enzyme kinetic assay and molecular modeling simulations [217]. The analysis of the kinetic assay showed that phloroglucinol is a potent and reversible inhibitor of the target enzyme in a dose-dependent but non-competitive
manner. Intriguingly, this finding was further validated with molecular docking and MD simulation results, which confirm that the compound stably binds in front of the active site of α-glucosidase rather than the enzyme active pocket. Another potentially impactful study involves the use of in vitro antibacterial screening, MurB enzyme inhibition assays, structure activity relationship (SAR) and molecular docking for the discovery of novel thiazoles [218]. Among the 15 thiazole derivatives tested experimentally, compound 6d with p-Meo group was found to be the most effective inhibitor of E. coli MurB enzyme, and analysis of the protein-ligand docked pose revealed three favorable H-bonds, which may account for the inhibitor’s high potency. In contrast, compound 4b, which emerged as the least potent compound, displayed 2 unfavorable/weak H-bond interactions which could be responsible for its lowest effect against the bacterial strain.
6. Conclusion/future perspective
Without any doubt, the ultimate goal of drug discovery research is to discover drugs that excel through rigorous pre-clinical and clinical stages before they can get approval. In the context of this review, it has been demonstrated that molecular modeling techniques are a viable and essential tool for drug discovery research, but we need to ask ourselves whether there has been any reported clinically approved drug discovered primarily with these components of computational modeling. To the best of our knowledge, the answer is a disappointing "NO". Although some studies that involved the discovery of novel chemical entities by purely in silico-based investigations and those that incorporated experimental/clinical research have attracted high impact factor journals like Nature with broad coverage [4], the fact is, without clinical success of these lead-like candidates, some problems pertaining to health remain unsolved. In a COVID-19 pandemic like this, when a microscopic coronavirus organism has claimed millions of lives throughout the globe, scientists in the field of molecular modeling and drug discovery should not be contented with the usage of softwares to execute their research ideas, but also learn computer programming like Python and R coding languages. This will help them unravel the algorithms used to develop the available softwares and how to manipulate them in order to foster better computational results. In this comprehensive review, we urge our readers particularly the beginners in molecular modeling field to not limit their efforts to only publishing papers in highly reputable journal but to also channel their energy and resources (if available) towards translational goal of drug discovery. Collaborating with pharmaceutical/biotechnological industries on in silico-based discovery should never be overlooked or ruled out in this course as it could facilitate and expedite translational research. It is very important to note that a quite number of novices started applying molecular modeling tools for the first time without theoretical basis and proper practices of computer-aided drug design, which have contributed to erroneous discovery and false positives [228]. This could be a bottleneck towards drug discovery and needs to be treated urgently. As we have comprehensively reviewed the theoretical basis of two key components of molecular modeling pivotal to drug discovery in the earlier sections of this review, we hope it will be a proper guide for beginners in the field. Finally, a critical factor that determines the success of drug candidates for approval is their ADMET profile. In fact, the sole reason some drugs have failed to pass through clinical trials is because of their poor pharmacokinetic and unacceptable pharmacodynamic parameters. Although a series of bioassays could be conducted to evaluate the ADMET profile of compounds, but they are often very taxing and expensive. Hence, this highlights the importance of the use of in silico ADMET predictions. Computational ADMET profiling is an essential tool that could accelerate the drug discovery process. However, the models on which computational ADMET servers/softwares were built have limitations, which raise a growing concern about the reliability of in

silico predictions of leads. In the ADMET section of our review, we have reported the hepatotoxicity, human ether-a-go-go (hERG) and AMES mutagenicity profiling of Acarbose, Chloroquine, and Lopinavir to be unfavorable according to the in silico Admetsar2 model [193], but the fact remains that the clinically approved drugs are standards which have been widely approved and used in the therapeutic treatment/management of diseases. So, there is a high propensity that the ADMET result may be false negative due to the inconsistency of computational ADMET models. Like the great minds in Deep Minds’ company, whose collaboration with structural biologists helped solve 50 years of protein folding problems with models of AI-based sophisticated technology [19], we hope researchers whose expertise are focused on developing algorithms come forward to improve ADMET models for better reliability. Surely, the success in this area would revolutionize and expedite the clinical success of drugs in this 21st century.
