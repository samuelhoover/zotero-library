Abstract: We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of 2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules.

Introduction
The two-body additive force fields (FFs) commonly used in biomolecular simulations calculate electrostatics using atom-centered point charges (atomic charges) within a simple Coulombic model. Quantitatively reproducing electrostatic interactions, which play a key role in nonbonded interactions such as ligand binding to a receptor, thus becomes the task of generating a suitable set of atomic charges. An atomic charge must represent not only the influence of the atom itself and its immediate bonded neighbors,
but it must also account for the local effects of any other nearby functional groups, extended  systems (with electron donating and withdrawing groups), and formal charges that may be present. Small molecule ligands such as those made and tested in pharmaceutical research can have all of these effects present simultaneously, and a satisfactory charge model must accommodate them all. Good atomic charges for two-body additive FFs can be ob

tained by fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule calculated at the HF/6-31G* level of theory; refs. 1 and 2 offer good background reviews on the subject. The HF/6-31G* level of theory (and the ESP-fit charges derived from it) overestimates the polarity of molecules by approximately 10 to 15% in addition to accounting for the electronic effects mentioned above. This overestimation offers a fortuitous “implicit” polarization to compensate for the fact that a two-body additive FF, by construction, does not include polarization; thus it balances the exaggerated polarity of widely used water models, for example, SPC, TIP3P, and TIP4P.1,2 This ESP-fit charge model has proven itself through being able to reproduce relative free energies between organic systems of interest within a FF formalism.3 While ESP-fit methods produce suitable charges for condensed phase simulations, there are inherent problems in current ESP-fit methods: charges are conformer dependent; charges on and near buried atoms (e.g., methyl carbon atoms) are numerically unstable, that is, their magnitude can vary widely while barely perturbing the quality of the fit; large molecules must be treated as a superposition of fragments due to computer resource limitations; and charges are not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules. In addition, the costs of the CPU intensive calculation of the ESP at the ab initio level pose a significant barrier to the routine use of ESP charges, especially in pharmaceutical applications where the computational evaluation of potential ligands requires ever-higher throughput. The need for a faster and more efficient method to generate high-quality atomic charges has led to the recently introduced AM1-BCC methodology.4 AM1 population charges5 (hereafter referred to as AM1 atomic charges), although incapable of satisfactorily reproducing the QM ESP, capture underlying electronic features such as formal charge and electron delocalization. Simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied based on the general atom and bond types in the molecule so that the resulting charges emulate the HF/6-31G* ESP that would be generated for that molecule. This approach differs fundamentally from previous efforts to approximate HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges based on scaling charges derived from a semiempirical wave function6a,b in that no scaling is involved. Scaling produces erroneous and nonintegral atomic charges when applied to formally charged molecules, and is built on the questionable assumption that for all the chemistry considered, a single global scaling factor can quantitatively transform the features of a semiempirical ESP into those of a HF/6-31G* ESP. Also, scaling does nothing to rectify the inherent numerical instability of the charge-fitting procedure.2 The AM1-BCC method is more similar in spirit to the CMx methods of Cramer and Truhlar,6c,d but the AM1-BCC method parameterizes additive corrections by fitting directly to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of molecules, whereas the CMx formalism involves a bondorder calculation from the wave function and is parameterized to fit molecular dipole moments. A more detailed comparison between these methods is given in the first article in this series (ref. 4), which describes the AM1-BCC methodology. The current work presents the global parameterization of the BCCs and the validation of the resulting AM1-BCC charge model. The goal of this work was to parameterize the BCCs for all organic
small molecules that could potentially be ligands for macromolecules. This requires a general atom- and bond-typing scheme that spans the required chemistry and a large training set that samples the atom- and bond-types. Once parameterized, a validation procedure consisting of FF calculations of hydrogen-bonded dimers and free energies of solvation was used to verify the quality of the charge model.
Methods
Electrostatic Potentials
The ab initio ESPs used for both the parameterization and for generating RESP (restrained electrostatic potential) charges7 were evaluated at the HF/6-31G* level of theory using GAUSSIAN92.8 A relativistic effective core potential was used for iodine with a valence space consisting of 4d, 5s, and 5p shells.9 The ESP was sampled using a face-centered cubic grid of points, with 0.5 Å spacing, located outside the van der Waals surface at 1.4 to 2.0 times the van der Waals radius of each atom. The standard two stage fitting protocol7 was used to fit RESP charges, except that because a more dense face-centered cubic grid of points was used instead of the Connolly grid,10 the charge restraints were recalibrated to 0.001 and 0.01 for the first and second stages, respectively.
AM1 Calculations
The AM15a calculations were performed using MOPAC 6.05b with the following input keywords: AM1 GEO-OK MMOK EF CHARGEn, where n is the net charge on the molecule. AM1 atomic charges used in this work are the atomic population charges produced by default by MOPAC 6.0 and are derived from the Coulson density matrix. The same charges can be obtained from GAUSSIAN9411 using the Iop(4/243) keyword, except for sulfur- or phosphorus-containing molecules, which will have incompatible charges because GAUSSIAN94 uses MNDO parameters for these atoms. For the training set used in the parameterization, geometry optimizations were carried out. When performing the AM1 calculation to obtain the population charges as precharges for the AM1-BCC method, it is important to avoid short-range through-space polar interactions such as intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Such interactions locally polarize the AM1 wave function, perturbing the population charges significantly away from the typical range for which the BCCs are parameterized. Adding the BCCs to such charges will yield a charge set with exaggerated polarization in that area. In such cases, an extended conformation without intramolecular hydrogen bonds should be used.

Dimer Energies
The binding energy Ebind between two molecules was evaluated as
Ebind  EAB  EA  EB (3)
where EAB is the energy of the hydrogen-bonded complex formed between molecules A and B, and EA and EB are the individual energies of molecules A and B, respectively. A validation set of 47 organic dimers and 27 DNA dimers was chosen to test the ability of the charge models to reproduce ab initio noncovalent interactions between homo- and hetero-dimers of molecules containing common organic functionalities. Monomers and dimers were energy minimized using the steepest descent method12 for 10 cycles and then switched to the conjugate gradient method12 until a DRMS of 0.1 kcal/mol Å was achieved. All FF dimer calculations were performed with the Cornell et al. force field13 using the Sander module of AMBER-5.01.14 The MP2/6-31G*(.25) energies for the DNA dimers were taken from ref. 15, and the MP2/ 6-31G** energies for the organic dimers were calculated using GAMESS16 at the HF/6-31G* geometries. All molecules were charged with the RESP, AM1, MMFF, and AM1-BCC charge models with the exception of the TIP3P water. Initial geometries for the DNA dimers were reproduced from ref. 15, while the organic molecule dimers were obtained from the MMFF validation suite available from the Computational Chemistry List.17
Free Energy Calculations
Free energy calculations were carried out using the Gibbs module of AMBER-5.01. Molecules were solvated in TIP3P water with 12 Å separating the solute from the edges of the box. The solvated systems were then minimized using the steepest descent method for 10 cycles and then switched to the conjugate gradient method until a DRMS of 0.1 kcal/mol Å was achieved. The systems were then subjected to 20 ps of molecular dynamics at 1 K in order to diffuse any buildup of potential energy that may have occurred during the placement of the waters. The next stage consisted of 20 ps of heating to 300 K followed by 40 ps of equilibration at the target temperature. The vdW  electrostatic perturbations were performed using slow growth over 200 ps. Free energy differences between charge models were evaluated using free energy perturbation (FEP) using 21 windows, with 400 steps of equilibration
and 600 steps of data collection per window. The reported perturbation energies are the mean values of the forward and reverse directions. All simulations were run at constant temperature (300 K) and pressure (1 atm) using a constant dielectric of 1 with a 10 Å nonbonded cutoff, 2 fs. time step, and SHAKE applied to all bonds containing hydrogen atoms except those involved in the perturbations. The potential of mean force (PMF) correction was calculated for perturbed bonds. Separate scaling factors were used for solvent and solute atoms with heat bath coupling constants of 0.2 ps while in the gas phase a coupling constant of 0.4 ps was used. The pressure relaxation time was set to 0.2 ps. The 1-4 nonbonded vdW and electrostatic interactions were scaled by 1/2 and 1/1.2, respectively.
Global Parameterization of BCCs
The objective of the global parameterization was to generate a complete set of BCCs that would enable this charge model to be used on any organic small molecule that might serve as a ligand in a biological context. To accomplish this, several considerations had to be taken into account. First, the breadth of organic chemical structures to be parameterized had to be characterized. With no analytic way to do this, we selected The Merck Index18 (an encyclopedia of 10,000 chemicals, drugs, and biological molecules) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) structure database of about 250,000 molecules,19 considering them to comprehensively sample the required chemistry. The bond types generated from the training set were compared to the bond types generated from The Merck Index and the NCI database. If bond types were present in either the Index or the database and not in the training set, then a minimum of four diverse molecules were created to sample the missing bond type. Second, an atom- and bond-typing scheme had to be chosen that would (a) encompass the required chemistry, (b) generate the smallest total number of parameters (BCCs) in order to make the computations tractable, and (c) give the best fit in terms of emulating the RHF/6-31G(d) ESP. Third, a training set of molecules had to be selected, against which the fitting was to be carried out. The fitting was carried out as described previously,4 based on the AM1 population charges and the RHF/6-31G(d) ESP of each molecule in the training set. The overall process was iterative, applying a trial atom- and bondtyping scheme to the small molecule databases to see what BCCs would require fitting, expanding the training set as needed for any new BCC parameter to be fit, simultaneously fitting the entire set of BCCs, and testing the resulting parameters. If not satisfactory, the atom- and bond-typing scheme was modified and the process repeated. Throughout the development of the atom- and bondtypes, the atom- and bond-typing schemes were kept simple and parsimonious so as to simplify the fitting process, decrease the degrees of freedom, and provide a robust method applicable to any organic molecule. Eleven elements were parameterized in this work: C, N, O, F, S, P, Cl, Br, I, Si, and H. Initially, atoms were typed according to element and valency. Seven bond orders were defined: single, double, triple, aromatic single, aromatic double, dative, and delocalized; however, the parameterization was based upon only six unique bond orders because aromatic single and

Five rules are given, beginning with a chemical substructure pattern and definitions of allowable atoms for X, Y, and Z. In the atom definitions, in parentheses after each element, x2 and x3 denote bivalent and trivalent atoms, respectively. If the chemical substructure for the rule has a match in the structure being typed, a property ar5, ar6, or ar7 may be attached to one or more atoms, identifying them as aromatic atoms in a 5, 6, or 7-membered ring, respectively. This property may then be used as part of the pattern in subsequent rules. The property of an atom may be modified by subsequent rules, so all five rules must be progressively applied. A bond between aromatic atoms is considered aromatic if and only if it is within the ring. In rule 5, the expression “Z!ar6,ar7” means “atoms Z are not part of a six- or seven-membered aromatic ring.” (b) Definition of the bond order codes: 01  single bond, 02  double bond, 03  triple bond, 06  dative bond (e.g., N-oxide), 07  aromatic single bond, 08  aromatic double bond, 09  single bond with charge (e.g., methoxide, sulfoxide, etc.) or delocalized bond (e.g., nitro or carboxy).

aromatic double bond orders were made equivalent. Reported here is only the final atom- and bond-typing scheme and the final training set of molecules, together with the derived final BCC parameter set.
Atom- and Bond-Typing
Atom- and bond-typing a molecule begins with assigning aromaticity to atoms using Figure 1a, starting with case 1 and progressing through case 5; bond types are then assigned using Figure 1b. An unusual feature of these rules concerns atoms in five-membered rings that are fused to six-membered aromatic rings. The uniquely five-membered ring bonds in these types of systems (e.g., the three atoms in the five-membered ring of indole) are not assigned aromatic bond types, although nonfused 5-membered heteroaromatic rings (e.g., pyrrole) are bond-typed as aromatic. This was necessary to achieve a good global fit. Once bond types are assigned, atom typing may then be performed.
Having started with elements subclassified only according to valency, further subclassification within the same valency was necessary for C, O, and N. In other cases, atom types of differing valencies could be combined. Carbon atom-types are thus C4,
C3
C, C3
N,P, C3
O,S, C1,2, Car, and Car
lp, where the subscripts refer to the valency (e.g., a carbon atom in a molecule of methanol would be classified as C4). The superscript, in general, refers to the bonded environment: C signifies a double bond to carbon, N,P signifies a double bond to nitrogen or phosphorus, and O,S signifies a double bond to oxygen or sulfur. C1,2 refers to a monoor divalent carbon (e.g., isonitriles and ketenes, respectively), and Car signifies an aromatic carbon atom. The superscript lp signifies that the atom is adjacent to an aromatic nitrogen or oxygen atom bearing a lone pair of electrons. Two aromatic carbon types were used because Car O X bond-types differed in their BCC value if they were adjacent to an aromatic atom containing a lone pair (i.e., N, O). For example, the BCC values for the Car O H bond-types in benzene and pyridine were 0.0128 and 0.1366, respectively. The

adjacent hydrogen atom in pyridine is compensating for the lack of a point charge (or BCC-type in the present charge model) needed to describe the nitrogen lone pair in the plane of the molecule.20 We term this phenomenon “atomic charge compensation” (ACC). In general, ACC occurs when a limited number of point charges are used to describe an ESP that varies quickly around a lone pair of electrons. In this work, we have allowed for ACC by differentiating two aromatic carbon atom-types: Car and Car
lp. Although aromatic carbons adjacent to aromatic sulfur and phosphorus should also suffer from ACC, it was found to be negligible for these atoms. Nitrogen atom-types are N2,3,4, N3
deloc, N 3
hdeloc, N2, and N1,2, where the subscripts represent valency and charge (e.g., N2,3,4
represents divalent anionic nitrogen, trivalent aliphatic nitrogen, or tetravalent cationic nitrogen). The superscripts deloc and hdeloc signify delocalized and highly delocalized, respectively. The subclassification of the N3 into N3
deloc and N 3
hdeloc was needed to distinguish between different levels of lone pair delocalization on conjugated nitrogen systems (e.g., to differentiate a delocalized amide nitrogen from a highly delocalized pyrrole nitrogen). Oxygen atom-types are O1,2, O1
ester,acid, and O1
lact where the superscript ester,acid denotes ester and acid functional groups, and lact signifies either a lactone or lactam. To get a good fit it was found necessary to separate carbonyl oxygen atom-types for the more stable trans form of esters and amides, found in most acyclic contexts, from the less-stable cis form usually encountered in
Figure 2. The atom-typing definitions. The atom-type of an atom in a molecule is determined by starting at the top of the tree for a given element and answering the questions in the boxes until the atom code is reached. Definitions: ar  aromatic; Oar  oxygen atom bearing lone pairs and in an aromatic ring; Nar  nitrogen atom bearing lone pairs and in an aromatic ring; deloc delocalized lone pair, for example, amide nitrogen atoms; hdeloc highly delocalized lone pair, for example, the nitrogen atom in indole, pyrrole, or nitro group.

lactones and lactams. The difference might be caused by ACC or the different electronic characters of the delocalized lone pairs of electrons between the cis and trans conformations. Phosphorus atom-types were classified simply as P2,3 and P3,4

where the superscript “” signifies a double bond. Sulfur atomtypes were classified as S1,2, S3, and S4. It was not necessary to further divide the monovalent atoms (i.e., the halogens and hydrogen) because the subclassifications of the C, N, O, S, and P atom-types provided enough degrees of freedom to fit the BCCs to the data. The final atom- and bond-type definitions are summarized in Table 1, with the last column giving the numeric codes used for the
BCCs; there are a total of 26 atom-types and six unique bond orders. The atom-typing flowchart for each element is depicted in Figure 2. Once these are assigned to a molecule, the BCC-type for bonded atoms i and j, having atom-types I and J, respectively, is then constructed by combining the numeric codes for atom-type I, the bond order O between atoms i and j, and atom-type J, giving BCC bond-type I-O-J. This atom- and bond-typing scheme is robust and general and can be used to unambiguously assign atom-types in an automated fashion, for example, using PATTY,21 a programmable atom-typer. An example of this bond-typing process is shown for piroxicam (Fig. 3). The atoms in the two outer phenyl rings are assigned to be

aromatic, while the remaining four atoms in the middle 6-membered ring and all other atoms in the molecule are assigned to be nonaromatic according to Figure 1. The aromatic bond-order codes (07 and 08 for aromatic single and double, respectively) are therefore assigned to the two outer aromatic rings while nonaromatic bond-order codes (01 and 02 for single and double, respectively) are assigned to the nonaromatic bonds. The atom-types are then determined using Figure 2. Using the amide carbon atom in piroxicam (Fig. 3) as an example, we begin at the top of the “carbon” tree in Figure 2 and descend by answering the questions in the boxes. Is the carbon tetravalent? No. Is it trivalent? Yes. Is it aromatic and trivalent? No. Is its double-bonded partner O or S? Yes, so the amide carbon atom-type is C(x3)AO,S, coded 14. This process is repeated for all the atoms in the molecule. The atomtypes and bond order codes are shown for piroxicam in Figure 3a and the resulting BCC-types are shown in Figure 3b. The BCC values for each bond-type in Figure 3b can be found in Table 2.
Training Set
The training set was composed of 2,755 organic molecules that sample organic bond-types composed of H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I atoms. Only limited sampling of Si bonds was made because they were not of primary interest; no effort was made to ensure that all Si bond-types were present in the training set. In order to improve the robustness of the BCCs, each bond-type was sampled across a minimum of four different chemical contexts. To ensure a diverse and systematic sampling of common organic bond-types, a scaffold/functional group scheme was developed. A set
of molecular scaffolds (Fig. 4) was created onto which were attached a variety of functional groups (Fig. 5), creating an array of chemical functionalities. Primary (pf) and secondary (sf) functional groups were added to primary scaffolds (ps). For example, functional group pf01 is added to scaffold ps08 to build a molecule of acetone, functional group pf07 is added to scaffold ps06 to build a molecule of phenol, and so on. Similarly, a set of secondary scaffolds (ss) (Fig. 4) was used with the primary functional groups (Fig. 5) to extended the range of functionalities. This scaffold/functional group scheme generated a total of 390 molecules after elimination of a few redundancies (e.g., ps06_pf01 and ps07_pf02). Although the above scheme sampled many bond-types, additional molecules were needed to sample cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl bond-types. The building schemes for these molecules are shown in Figure 6, which generated a set of 723 molecules. To further improve sampling and extend the variety of bond-types, the MMFF94 validation suite of 761 molecules was obtained from the Computational Chemistry List17 (CCL) and incorporated into the training set. Additionally, to complete the training set during the iterative modifications of the atomtyping scheme, approximately 900 extra molecules were created manually. In retrospect, a much more complete scaffold/functional-group approach would have reduced this large latter category.
BCCs
With the above atom- and bond-typing schemes (i.e., Figs. 1 and 2), The Merck Index and the NCI database showed that only 354 BCCs would cover the desired chemical variability. Of these, 29 were zero by atom-type symmetry (e.g., C4O C4, bond code 11 01

11), and 16 of them were made equivalent to ensure symmetry in aromatic molecules (e.g., Car
lp arom N2 and Car
lp arom N2, bond codes 17 07 24 and 17 08 24, respectively). This left 309 unique BCCs to be fit to the 44,194 bonds in the training set of 2755 molecules. These BCCs were fit to the ESP of the training set using the methodology given in ref. 4, yielding a relative RMS (c.f. ref.
4) of 0.50. The Pearson correlation matrix for the 354 BCCs was calculated to evaluate interdependencies between them. Of the 62,500 nonequivalent BCC pairs all but 15 pairs showed a correlation of less than 0.6, indicating little correlation between most parameters. Of the 15 remaining BCC pairs, 12 were between 0.6 and 0.7, and the remaining three fell in the range of 0.7 to 0.8. These correlated BCCs were between bonds from H, C, O, and N to a common central atom, where that central atom was tetravalent silicon, hypervalent sulfur, or hypervalent phosphorus. The latter two cases were represented in the training set by sulfones, sulfonamides, sulfonyl esters, and the corresponding phosphorus species. These tetrahedral species tend to have four bulky and often similar substituents attached, which may lead to the correlation. The correlation matrix confirmed that, in general, the BCCs were independent from each other. Subsequent to the fit, five BCCs were adjusted a posteriori to improve the relative free energies of solvation (RFES) of amines, nitros, and unsaturated hydrocarbons. These adjustments will be discussed in the next section. The BCC-types parameterized in this work are listed in Table 2, which presents the bond-types, the BCC values, and the number of times they occur in the training set. These BCCs make it possible to charge any molecule in either The Merck Index or the NCI small-molecule database, except for molecules containing boron or molecules containing covalently bound metal atoms.
Validation of the AM1-BCC Charge Model
The validation examined the ability of AM1-BCC charges, in the context of a FF, to reproduce experimental or high-level ab initio

data of nonbonded interactions between organic molecules. AM1BCC charges were used in the Cornell et al.13 FF to test the ability to reproduce homo- and hetero-dimer energies of a set of diverse small organic molecules and experimental RFES of small organic molecules. Conformational energies were not examined here because the 1,4 electrostatic term is only a component of the torsional energy in a FF, and not necessarily a dominant one; conformational energies reflect the combined overall parameterization of the FF, in particular the explicit torsional term.
Dimer Energies
The hydrogen-bonded energies of diverse but simple organic homo- and hetero-dimers (see Fig. 7 for representative structures) were compared between ab initio calculated values (HF/ 6-31G* and MP2/6-31G**, referred to as HF and MP2, respectively, hereafter) and RESP, AM1, MMFF, and AM1BCC charge models (see Table 3). For comparison purposes, in Table 3 after the dimer energy for each charge model is given, the difference with the two ab initio values, for example, after each RESP value, is given HF  E(HF)  E(RESP) and MP2  E(MP2)  E(RESP). As expected, the AM1 population charges alone showed poor performance here and throughout the validation, but they served as a means of comparison for the improvement introduced with the BCCs. The MMFF charge model performed best overall with respect to MP2 energies, with a mean unsigned error of 0.74 kcal/mol. Interestingly, the MMFF charge model was parameterized for a “buffered” vdW and electrostatic functional form,22 not the AMBER electrostatic functional form13 in which it was used for this work. However, the good performance of MMFF must also be interpreted in light of the fact that the dimer energies of dimers 1 through 40 were part of the dimer training set23 of MMFF. The AM1-BCC model has the same mean unsigned error (i.e., 0.93 kcal/mol) with respect to both HF and MP2 (see Table 3). However, examination of the mean error reveals that AM1-BCC tends to overestimate the binding energy with respect to HF (0.53 kcal/mol) and underestimate it with respect to MP2 (0.36 kcal/ mol), also observed with RESP (0.61 and 0.28 kcal/mol, respectively). Conversely, the AM1 charge model underestimates the binding energy (1.98 and 2.87 kcal/mol) and the MMFF charge model overestimates it (1.24 and 0.35 kcal/mol) with respect to both HF and MP2, respectively. When compared to the HF dimer energies, the AM1-BCC charge model performs best overall with a mean unsigned error of 0.93 kcal/mol, while RESP has a mean unsigned error of 1.01 kcal/mol. However, compared to MP2, RESP slightly outperforms AM1-BCC (0.88 and 0.93 kcal/ mol). Overall, the RESP and AM1-BCC charge models perform similarly, producing dimer energies that tend to fall in between HF and MP2 values. This behavior is consistent with the results found in earlier work.4 The DNA hydrogen-bonding dimer calculations were based on the extensive work of S ̆ poner et al.15 As well as the biological importance of these dimers, the DNA bases are also highly delocalized polar molecules and thus they served as a challenging arena to compare the performance of the AM1-BCC charge model against other models. Representative structures for the DNA
dimers taken from ref. 15 are shown in Figure 8, while Table 4 compares the dimer energies of the RESP, AM1, MMFF, and AM1-BCC charge models to those taken from ref. 15, calculated at ab initio HF/6-31G** and MP2/6-31G*(.25) levels. Again, the AM1 charge model performed very poorly, with large mean unsigned errors of 4.8 and 6.2 kcal/mol for HF and MP2 energies, respectively; this model will not be considered further. For the MP2 energies, the mean error shows that, on average, RESP and MMFF slightly underestimated the hydrogenbond strengths while AM1-BCC slightly overestimated them. Compared to HF, MMFF performed the best; all three charge models overestimated the dimer strengths. The MP2 mean unsigned error for both RESP and AM1-BCC was 1 kcal/mol, consistent with their behavior in the organic homo- and heterodimers (Table 3). This demonstrates the ability of these two charge models to account for the delocalization and dense functionalization in the DNA bases. In contrast, while MMFF had the smallest mean unsigned error in the organic homo- and hetero-dimers (0.74 kcal/mol, see Table 3), this error more than doubled in the DNA dimer energies (1.7 kcal/mol), which were not included in the MMFF parameterization set. All charge models reproduced the correct ordering of the AT base pairs, that is, the AT Hoogsteen base pair is stronger than the Watson-Crick AT base pair.24
Densely Functionalized Molecules
A crucial requirement for a charge model in the pharmaceutical industry is that it properly accounts for the electrostatics of densely functionalized molecules. A large proportion of the molecules in The Merck Index, a wide representation of drug and druglike molecules, contain multiple functional groups crowded close together. In this section, we compare the ability of RESP, AM1, MMFF, and AM1-BCC to correctly capture the electrostatics (vis-a-vis the QM ESP) of four neutral molecules, shown in Figure 9, having varying degrees of functionalization: ethanol, a simple monofunctionalized molecule; homarine, a zwitterion; p-methoxy benzenesulfonate, having both electron-donating and -withdrawing groups; and the multi- and densely functionalized cation Nmethyl-N -cyano-N-nitrosoguanidinium (a variant of the carcinogen N-methyl-N -nitro-N-nitrosoguanine). Table 5 shows the RMS deviation of the four charge models with respect to the QM ESP for the molecules in Figure 9. The RESP, AM1, and AM1-BCC charge models perform as expected: poorly performing AM1 atomic charges are much improved by the addition of the BCCs, while RESP performs best overall. For the ethanol molecule, with a single functional group, MMFF performs moderately with an RMS of 0.0408 a.u. However, for the three molecules with more than one functional group, the quality of the MMFF fit greatly deteriorates, yielding RMS deviations of 0.5, significantly higher than even AM1. Even though MMFF was parameterized within the context of a FF having a different functional form23 than the one in which it was applied here, these large deviations are nevertheless worrisome, possibly resulting from the neglect of explicit delocalized electron-donating and -withdrawing in that model.

Relative Free Energies of Solvation
The calculation of the relative free energies of solvation (RFES) is a critical test of the ability of a FF to correctly capture the dynamic noncovalent interactions between solute and solvent. Unlike the dimer energies, where comparisons were made to quantum mechanical data, the RFES allow a direct comparison to experimental data and therefore provide the most important comparisons. Also, the RFES reflect an ensemble average sampling of many configurations of solvent around the entire solute, as opposed to a single energy-minimized configuration as with the dimers. The RFES in this work were chosen to be between systems as isosteric as possible, but of very different polarity. This places the burden on the electrostatic term for the RFES and thus focuses on the charge
model, minimizing the vdW contributions. Because a two-body additive FF has difficulty reproducing the free energy of charging for solutes bearing a formal charge,25 ions were not included in these calculations. An explicit polarization term appears to be required to accurately reproduce the free energy of solvation of ions.26 Table 6 shows a comparison of RFES for organic molecules using the same four charge models; the experimental values used came from refs. 27 and 28. In general, RESP, AM1, and AM1-BCC underestimate the RFES while MMFF overestimates them, as shown by the mean errors. The mean unsigned errors show that AM1-BCC reproduced the experimental data better than RESP (0.69 vs. 1.36, respectively). This is at least in part due to five BCCs that, a posteriori, were

0.2048) and C4O N2,3,4 (from 0.0864 to 0.1582) BCC values in order to reproduce the experimentally observed free energy of solvation trends of the amine series:29 ammonia (4.3 kcal/mol), methylamine (4.6 kcal/mol), dimethylamine (4.3 kcal/mol), and trimethylamine (3.2 kcal/mol). Testing the validity of these changes, these adjustments also improved the RFES of pyrrolidine to cyclopentane from 3.96 to 5.73 kcal/mol (experimental value of 6.68 kcal/mol); piperidine to cyclohexane from 4.13 to 5.77 kcal/ mol (experimental value of 6.34 kcal/mol); and methylpiperidine to methylcyclohexane from 2.96 to 5.48 kcal/mol (experimental value of 5.60 kcal/mol).

hdeloc deloc O1,2 required a large adjustment from 0.1203 to 0.1500, changing the RFES of nitroethane to isopentane from 10.54 to 5.57 kcal/mol, in close agreement with the experimental value of 6.08 kcal/mol. Similarly, the RFES of nitrobenzene to isopropylbenzene changed from 7.44 to 4.48 kcal/mol, approaching the experimental value of 3.80 kcal/mol. We noticed that the AM1 charge model better reproduced the RFES for perturbations to unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., cyclopentene to cyclopentane) than did AM1-BCC before adjustment, suggesting that a BCC was not needed for COH bonds in unsaturated hydrocarbons. Consequently, unsaturated hydrocarbon

BCCs (i.e., C3
COH1 and CarOH1 ) were set to zero, which gave rise to RFES closer to experiment. The change from 0.0116 to 0.0000 for C3
COH1 made only modest improve
ments, while the adjustment from 0.0128 to 0.000 for CarOH1 improved the RFES of benzene to cyclohexane from 0.87 to 1.50 kcal/mol, approaching the experimental value of 2.09 kcal/mol. We found that setting the BCC for C4OH1 to zero had an overall unfavorable effect on the RFES of methylated molecules, so it was left untouched.
Overall Performance
The correlations between RESP, AM1, MMFF, and AM1-BCC for the ab initio dimer energies and the experimental RFES are shown
in Table 7. For the organic dimer energies all models except for AM1 correlate well with both ab initio methods with correlation coefficients above 0.95. For the DNA dimers, both RESP and AM1-BCC had very good correlation coefficients with the ab initio dimer energies, although those for MMFF deteriorate. The AM1-BCC model achieves the best correlation with experiment for the RFES, partially attributable to the five adjusted BCCs (see above). In general, AM1 population charges perform poorly in every context. MMFF does well with molecules bearing simple organic functionality around which it was parameterized, but does less well in densely functionalized or charged molecules. RESP does well in all contexts except for known liabilities in the RFES of amines and nitro groups. AM1-BCC consistently maintained a high correlation coefficient (0.95) in all contexts.
Conclusions
The AM1-BCC atomic charge method adjusts an initial set of AM1 atomic charges, which do not emulate the HF/6-31G* ESP around a molecule, into a new set of charges that do, using simple additive correction terms applied to the AM1 charges. This charge model thus quickly generates high-quality atomic charges suitable for simulations in polar solution-phase systems: the user of the AM1-BCC model simply needs to calculate AM1 atomic charges and apply the BCCs; there are no ab initio calculations to perform. A training set of 2755 organic molecules was created to parameterize the 309 unique nonzero BCCs of the 354 sample bond-types

Five BCCs were adjusted a posteriori to better reproduce the RFES of the amine series, aromatic and olefinic hydrocarbons, and nitrocontaining functionalities. The resulting set of BCC parameters allows the model to charge any molecule in The Merck Index and
the NCI database of small molecules, except molecules that contain boron or covalently bound metal atoms. Although silicon BCCs are present, a complete set of silicon BCCs has not been parameterized in this work.

able to reproduce correlated ab initio hydrogen-bonded organic homo- and hetero-dimer energies within, on average, 0.95 kcal/ mol, and hydrogen-bonded DNA dimer energies to within 0.9 kcal/mol, on average. These energies tend to fall in between HF and MP2 values. This model was also validated against RFES of isosteric small organic molecules, reproducing experimental relative free energies to within 0.69 kcal/mol, on average. The AM1BCC charge model consistently maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96 for all the validation tests with respect to ab initio and experiment, and therefore we propose it as a general method to charge organic molecules for use in solution phase simulations.
