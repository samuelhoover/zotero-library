ABSTRACT
Aqueous solutions containing polyzwitterions and polyelectrolytes were studied to probe the effects of chemical specificity on the complexation among different types of chains and resulting liquid–liquid phase separation (coacervation). Two kinds of blends were studied. A polyzwitterion, poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA), was blended with either (1) a polycation, poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC), or (2) a poly­ anion, sodium poly(styrene sulphonate) (NaPSS). Coacervation was observed in both blends after equilibration, while the freshly prepared blend solutions exhibited distinct behavior dependent on the mixing protocols. Mixing solutions of the polyzwitterions and the polycations led to coacervation almost instantaneously. In contrast, the blends containing the same polyzwitterions and the polyanions exhibited no such coacervation by following the same mixing protocol. However, blends prepared after dissolving a solid mixture containing the same poly­ zwitterions and the polyanions in water exhibited coacervation. Based on the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryo-electron microscopy, and rheology measurements, complexation and coacervation in the polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte blends is rationalized in terms of the entropy change associated with reorgani­ zation of solvent (water), which appears to be larger in the polyzwitterion-polycation case in comparison with the polyzwitterion-polyanion blends. These results highlight the importance of chemical specificity and mixing protocols leading to metastable structures in designing a new class of materials based on macromolecular complexation of polyzwitterions.

1. Introduction
Complexation of charged polymers has been a topic of extensive research [1–6] due to its relevance to the development of a number of technologies such as biosensors, underwater adhesives, drug-delivery systems, and membranes. Processing of the complexes based on charged polymers has been made possible due to the dependence of rheological properties of these complexes on salt [3,4]. Due to the effects of salt on processing of the complexes, a new class of materials termed as “saloplastic” has emerged, where salt has been used as an aid in pro­ cessing [3,4]. These materials include a mixture of polyanions such as sodium poly(styrenesulphonate) (NaPSS) and polycations such as poly (diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) mixed with water and salt. Effects of mixing ratios, chain lengths, temperature, salt-type,

and salt-concentration on rheological properties of the mixtures have been studied extensively [7–10]. These mixtures undergo a liquid–liquid phase separation due to gain in entropy [11,12] resulting from release of counterions and solvent (water) reorganization when oppositely charged polymers complex with each other. A major focus of previous studies has been to understand and control properties of the dense phase (coacervate) containing polymer chains, which coexist with a superna­ tant phase containing primarily ultra-dilute concentration of polymer chains. Due to the liquid–liquid phase separation, the complexation in oppositely charged polyelectrolytes [13] can be used to generate ma­ terials spanning a continuum ranging from extremely hydrated dense phase (coacervate) to fully dehydrated (“solid” precipitate) complexes.
In recent years, polyzwitterions, a special class of polyampholytes [14–16], have emerged, which exhibit quite interesting properties in

aqueous solutions [17–23]. Polyzwitterions have been studied exten­ sively due to their relevance for various applications such as anti-fouling coatings [24–27], low-friction materials for synovial joints [28], drugdelivery systems based on coacervation, [6] and solid-state batteries [29]. Based on the synthesis scheme, polyzwitterions can be synthesized without any “free” counterions such that a polyzwitterionic chain re­ mains net neutral but contains explicit positive and negative charges in each monomer. This, in turn, means that a complex formed by such a polyzwitterionic chain and a polyelectrolyte chain, will carry the charge of the polyelectrolyte chain and can act as an effective polyelectrolyte chain. Such a complexation between a polyzwitterion and a poly­ electrolyte chain is fundamentally different from a complexation be­ tween oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chains because the complexation involving a polyzwitterion doesn’t gain the entropy of counterion release, while it has been shown that the entropy of the counterion release [11,12] plays a significant role in driving the complexation of oppositely charged polymers. Additional driving forces resulting from solvent reorganization [12] on complexation of a poly­ zwitterion and a polyelectrolyte may drive the complexation towards liquid–liquid phase separation (co-acervation). Previous reports [30–32,24,33–36] on complexation of polyzwitterions and poly­ electrolytes in aqueous solutions have shown that 1) polyzwitterionpolyelectrolyte complexes can indeed undergo liquid–liquid phase sep­ aration but the dense phase (coacervate phase) contains nonstochiometric complexes [31,32,35] containing majority of poly­ zwitterions. This, in turn, implies that supernatant phase contains either paired polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte chains or the polyelectrolytes. This kind of liquid–liquid phase separation is called cascade complexa­ tion [31]. 2) The cascade complexation is primarily observed in solu­ tions of polyzwitterions and polycations [31,32,35]. In contrast, blends

containing polyzwitterions and polyanions such as poly(carbox­ ybetaines) and poly(ionenes), respectively, were reported to exhibit no liquid–liquid phase separation [31–33]. Instead, highly viscous solu­ tions were obtained on mixing solutions of polyzwitterions and poly­ anions, which exhibited altered upper critical solution temperatures (UCST) in comparison with that of the polyzwitterions. These results point out an importance of chemical specificity in coacervates based on polyzwitterions.
Origin of this chemical specificity can be understood by considering attractive ion–dipole interactions between a polyzwitterion and a polyelectrolyte chain. Based on ion–dipole interactions [20,37], which can either be repulsive or attractive depending on orientation of the dipoles in electric field of the ions, the complexation between a poly­ zwitterion chain and a polyanion (Fig. 1(a)) should differ from that of the same polyzwitterion and a polycation (Fig. 1(c)) in two ways. First, the complexation between the anions and the finite sized dipoles in Fig. 1(a) will have the distance of closest approach limited by the steric effects originating from the backbone of the polyzwitterion chain. There is no such limitation on the distance of the closest approach in the case of the complexation between the same polyzwitterion and a polycation. Due to the fact that the distances of the closest approach among ions and dipoles are smaller for the polyzwitterion-polycation complex than the polyzwitterion-polyanion, the complexes formed by polyzwitterions and polycations are expected to exhibit higher strengths than those based on polyzwitterions and polyanions. This expectation results from the more attractive ion–dipole interactions in the polyzwitterion-polycation complex in comparison with the polyzwitterion-polyanion complex. Second, the polyzwitterion-polyanion complex must be negatively charged and the polyzwitterion-polycation complex must be positively charged with the oppositely charged counterions screening the net

charge. So, the entropy of counterion release can not provide a strong thermodynamic force for the complexation. Rather, the entropy of sol­ vent reorganization remains a strong thermodynamic force for the complexation, which can be shown to be dependent on temperature dependence of the dielectric constant of the solvent [37]. Furthermore, the net charge of the complex plays an important role in setting up the direction of a growth front on which more and more polyzwitterion chains can complex further (see Fig. 1(b) and (d)). Such a complexation is termed as the cascade complexation [35], leading to liquid–liquid phase separation so that the dense phase should have excess of poly­ zwitterions. Hence, complexation driven primarily by ion–dipole attraction should have led to the similar results for the liquid–liquid phase separation in the blends containing polyzwitterion-polycation and polyzwitterion-polyanion pairs in the same solvent. The two pairs differ in the first complex between a polyzwitterion and a polyelectrolyte. We should point out that the pairs should behave the same way (i.e., inde­ pendent of the charge of the polyelectrolyte) if the theoretical analysis is done on the basis of orientationally averaged ion–dipole interactions [20,37]. In this sense, reported results so far in the literature showing liquid–liquid phase separation primarily in polyzwitterion-polycation blends remain poorly understood and don’t provide a clear explana­ tion for the experimentally observed chemical specificity in polyzwitterion-based coacervates.
In this work, we investigate the origin of chemical specificity in the polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte coacervates and show an importance of the metastable nature of the solutions. In turn, the chemical specificity can be used to develop materials exhibiting either liquid–liquid phase separation (coacervates) or thermosensitive viscous liquids by changing mixing protocols. In agreement with other reports, we have found that mixing solutions of a sulfobetaine (PSBMA) with polycations like PDADMAC exhibit coacervation spontaneously. In contrast, mixing so­ lutions of the same polyzwitterion with polyanions like NaPSS leads to highly viscous fluids, which span the whole sample volume without any supernatant phase. Here we focus more on understanding the reasons for the lack of coacervation in the mixtures containing polyzwitterions and polyanions. SAXS is used to investigate structure of the solutions con­ taining the polyzwitterions and the polyanions, which shows that these solutions contain polyzwitterion-polyanion pairs and these pairs act as

effective polyanions (in agreement with Fig. 1(a)) but don’t undergo coacervation, cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM) confirms this by directly visualizing the complexes. These results show that complexa­ tion of polyzwitterions with polycations is similar to that the poly­ zwitterions and polyanions. However, coacervation requires additional driving force (likely due to solvent reorganization), which is dominant in solutions containing the polyzwitterions and the polycations. Furthermore, dissolution of a solid mixture of the polyzwitterions and the polyanions exhibit coacervation, which highlights the role of kinetic effects in the coacervation.
This paper is organized as follows: the next section shows Results for the blends followed by the Conclusions. Details of the synthesis, experimental measurements, and data analysis are presented in the Experimental Section, and the Supplementary Materials.
2. Results
We have synthesized a poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) with molecular weight of Mn = 143 kg/mol by free radical polymeri­ zation of a zwitterionic monomer. For preparing blends with poly­ electrolytes, we have purchased PDADMAC (polycations), and NaPSS (polyanions). Chemical structures and molecular weights of the poly­ cations, PDADMAC, and the polyanions, NaPSS, are presented in Fig. 2a) and and Table 1, respectively. These polymers are referred to as PZs, PCs, and PAs, which are abbreviations for polyzwitterions, polycations, and polyanions, respectively. For improving solubility of the PZs in water, and processing of the blends, potassium bromide (KBr) was used.
Fig. 2(b) shows the SAXS curves of the solutions with varying

concentrations of the PZs, which exhibit different scattering patterns, and power-law behaviors. SAXS results show that solution behaviors of the PZs in aqueous solution deviate from that of charged polymers. Charged polymers usually show a peak in SAXS (referred to as poly­ electrolyte peak) resulting from electrostatic correlations. In contrast, the PZ chains show scattering pattern similar to uncharged polymers, which is in qualitative agreements with our recent work on similar polyzwitterions (i.e., polysulfobetaines) in dilute aqueous solutions [23]. The SAXS data were fit using correlation length model combined with power law model. Specifically, we fit the SAXS data using a cor­ relation length model, written as

where the first term describes the Porod scattering from clusters with

exponent = n. The second term is a Lorentzian function describing

scattering from polymer chains with exponent = m. This second term

characterizes the polymer/solvent interactions and therefore the ther­

modynamics. The two multiplicative factors A and C, the incoherent

background B and the two exponents n and m are used as fit parameters.

Another fit parameter, ξ is a correlation length for the polymer chains.

Note that when m = 2, this functional form becomes the familiar Lor­

entzian function used for the long neutral polymer chains exhibiting

random walk statistics. In solutions, we expect m to vary with the con­

centration due to mixing of chains and solvent molecules. Even with the

concentration dependent m, ξ represents the characteristic distance in

the polymer solutions.

Using the correlation length model, one can obtain information

about inter-chain and intra-chain correlation and mass fractal dimen­

sion, m. Extracted fit parameters are shown in Fig. 2(c,d). It is found that

the inter-/intra-chain correlation length (ξ) decreases with polymer

concentration since chains becomes more crowded with an increase in

the concentration. The correlation length (ξ) dependence on the con­

centration, ξ = 524.8c− 0.71 as shown in Fig. 2(c) agrees well with the

literature value measured for neutral polymer (polystyrene) [40] and

close to the expected ξ ∼ c− 3/4 scaling for semi-dilute solutions of

neutral polymers in good solvent [38,39]. Also, the zero angle scattering

normalized by the polyzwitterion concentrations, I(0)/c decreases as per

the predicted form [41] i.e., I(0)/c ∼ [ 1] , where wpp is the

excluded volume parameter (in units of Å3), NA = 6.023 × 1023, Mn is the molecular weight (in gm/mol) and N is the number of Kuhn statis­

tical segments. Here, I(0) = C +B in Eq. 1. The mass fractal dimension

(m) increases with concentration since solution contains more polymer

chains within the same volume (see Fig. 2d). The extracted mass fractal

dimension, m = 1.7, 2 and 2.6 are close to those of swollen chains, ideal

Gaussian chains and globules, respectively, however the individual

polymer chain conformation might not be as such.

For the purpose of studying effects of chemical specificity in

polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte coacervates, we have mixed solutions

containing 1) the PZs and the PCs, and 2) the same PZs and the PAs. We

have observed coacervation in the mixtures of the PZs and the PCs

within minutes. In contrast, no coacervation was observed on mixing the

solutions of the PZs and the PAs. These results are in qualitative

agreements with previous reports on other mixtures of polyzwitterions,

polycations, and polyanions [31–33,35]. As these results point out the

importance of chemical specificity in polyzwitterion-based coacervates,

we have investigated reasons for the lack of coacervation in the mixtures

containing PZs and PAs. These mixtures should have behaved similar to

the mixtures of PZs and PCs if the coacervation were to be driven by

orientationally averaged ion–dipole attractive interactions [37]. Indeed,

coacervation was observed in the solutions prepared by dissolving solid

mixtures of the PZs and the PAs in water. In retrospect, these results

imply that the coacervation in the mixtures of the PZs and

polyelectrolytes is affected by a gain in entropy due to solvent reorga­ nization, which must be higher in the case of the PZ-PC blends in comparison with the PZ-PA blends. Furthermore, complexation of the PZ and the PA chains in the solutions may lead to kinetically-trapped highly viscous fluids. In the following, we present these results highlighting effects of chemical specificity in polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte blends.
2.1. Coacervation in the Polyzwitterion-Polycation (PZ-PC) Mixtures
Fig. 3 shows images of the solutions at room temperature containing blends of the PZs and the PCs at different concentrations by weight but at the same mixing ratio of 1 : 1 and at two different concentrations of KBr. For both sets of the aqueous solutions containing 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/ mL KBr, PZ-PC coacervates precipitated out when lower concentrations of polymer stock solutions were mixed (e.g., 25 mg/mL PZ-25 mg/mL PC, 50 mg/mL PZ-50 mg/mL PC) (see images 1,2,4, and 5 in Fig. 3). In contrast, higher concentrations of the polymer solutions (e.g., 100 mg/ mL PZ-100 mg/mL PC-10 mg/mL KBr), exhibited water soluble com­ plexes and liquid–liquid phase separation. Zoomed-in images of the panels (3) and (6) in Fig. 3 are shown in Fig. 4, which clearly show that the liquid–liquid phase separation (coacervation) is dependent on the salt content, which is a well-established phenomenon in mixtures con­ taining oppositely charged polyelectrolytes [3,13]. A similar depen­ dence of the coacervation on the salt content in polyzwitterion based blends is expected due to the electrostatic screening of multipolar in­ teractions [20,23]. Specifically, in the Fig. 4 (right), the dense phase appearing at the bottom is the PZ-PC coacervate, while the supernatant phase at the top contains the polymers with very low concentration. In contrast, turbid homogeneous PZ-PC coacervate solution is obtained by mixing high concentrated polymer stock solutions in 20 mg/mL KBr aqueous solution (Fig. 4 (left)). These results are in qualitative agree­ ments with previous reports and point out that the coacervate phase should contain non-stochiometric complexes with the PZs in excess (i.e., cascade complexation) [31,35]. Also, the coacervation should be driven by the solvent reorganization [35]. Structure of these solutions were characterized using Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results from these techniques support the hypothesis of phase segregation in these mixtures (see Figures S1, S3, and S5 in the Supplementary Materials).
2.2. Complexation and coacervation in the polyzwitterion-polyanion (PZPA) mixtures
Fig. 5 shows images of the mixtures prepared by mixing solutions of the PZs and the PAs (NaPSS) at the same weight concentrations as used for the PZ-PC blends. In contrast to the behavior seen in the PZ-PC so­ lutions, no liquid–liquid phase separation was observed. Instead, highly viscous translucent solutions were obtained (Fig. 5). The solutions were yellowish due to the PAs used in these blends and the color becomes more yellow with higher PA content. Also, at the room temperature (RT), these liquids become highly viscous (and behave like a physical gel) especially with an increase in polymer concentration (Fig. 6 (top row)). Furthermore, an increase in temperature leads to a decrease in viscosity of these solutions (Fig. 6 (bottom row)).
To quantify the viscoelastic properties of these solutions, rheological measurements were performed on the salt-free 250 mg/mL PZ-250 mg/ mL PA-H2O sample. Due to the concern of solvent evaporation, we did not perform rheological measurements at elevated temperatures (e.g., 100◦C). An increased concentration of the polymers was used to estab­ lish whether a physical gel can be obtained based on the complexation among the PZ and the PA chains. Fig. 7a shows that the dynamic modulus of these solutions is reminiscent of that of an entangled poly­ mer solution: a rubbery “plateau” is observed at high frequencies and terminal flow behavior is found at low frequencies. This result is in agreement with the qualitative behavior displayed in Fig. 6. Addition­ ally, the sample exhibits strain softening behavior under large-

amplitude oscillatory shear (Fig. 7b). An increase in viscosity on mixing the PZs and the PAs implies that
there must be accompanying structural changes. Lack of liquid–liquid phase separation in these mixtures hints that these changes must be different from the solutions containing the PZs and the PCs and cannot be described using non-stochiometric/cascade complexation driven by the solvent reorganization. For understanding structural changes on

mixing the PZs and the PAs, we have used SAXS, and these results are presented in Fig. 8. As complexes of the PZs and the PAs will act as effective PAs, we hypothesize that the increase in viscosity can be interpreted in terms of complexation leading to effective polyanions. In order to verify this hypothesis, we fitted the measured SAXS patterns by a worm-like (flexible charged cylinder) model, inset in Fig. 8(b) con­ voluted with a structure factor based on the Random Phase

this implies that the viscous liquids possessed the worm-like micelles with almost identical dimensions, so that the almost identical form factor of worm- like micelles leads to the same scattering at high-q, while the deviations at low-q results from increasing contribution of structure factor resulting from interactions between worm-like micelles. The concentration-dependent parameter vRPA can be rationalized by considering monopolar and dipolar interactions involving the mono­ mers and the solvent [42,41]. Overall, these results show that the PZs and the PAs form complexes but doesn’t undergo liquid–liquid phase separation. This, in turn, implies that solvent reorganization mechanism leading to cascade complexation in the PZs and the PCs must not be strong enough in the case of the PZs and the PAs. These molecular mechanisms, driving the coacervation, need to be investigated in more details to understand the origin of the chemical specificity observed in the polyzwitterion-based coacervates.
In our attempt to observe coacervation in the blends containing the polyzwitterions and the polyanions, we used a different preparation method. In this method, we first mixed the solid polymers and KBr; and then added the solvent. This led to solutions with a visual liquid liquid phase separation (Fig. 9). This implies that the coacervation in the blends prepared by mixing solutions of the polyzwitterions and the polyanions is affected by kinetic effects, where the complexation among the chains may render the solution as one-phase instead of being phase separated. This was further evaluated with SEM images from samples that were prepared similarly to the PZ-PC counterparts (see Figures S4, S5, and S6 in Supplementary Materials).

contrast micrographs with high particle density. We took a similar approach to observe any structural changes in the PZ-PA blends. Fig. 10 shows two representative micrographs for PA alone and PZ-PA blend at concentrations five to twenty times lower than those probed by the SAXS. Despite multiple attempts, the PZ sample was never observed in the grid holes and appears to have an affinity to the carbon support

instead (data not shown). Future experiments will alter the chemical properties of the grid surface to overcome this preferred binding and allow for imaging of PZ samples.
We utilized CryoSPARC™ to evaluate our datasets and produce 3D reconstructions of the samples [43]. Within the CryoSPARC™ work­ space various algorithms are available to increase contrast (Topaz

denoise) [44], correct for the contrast-transfer function (CTFFIND4) [45], and correct for sample and stage drift (MotionCor2) [46]. Various Deep Neural Networks (DNN) automated particle picking regimes are also available in this software package. This work utilized template-free filament tracing to determine filament length and distribution and blobpicker to select more globular images. Fig. 10 shows the filament tracing results for two representative PA and PZ-PA micrographs. In the PA micrographs, filaments adopted an elongated, worm-like structure. In the PZ-PA micrographs, we see the worm-like state present and the emergence of a secondary structural state (green circles) with multiple filaments aligning in a globular-like formation. Ab-initio and symmetryfree reconstructions of the filament-traced particles produced two structures that differ slightly in their length and thickness (Fig. 11) but adopt similar (worm-like) structures. For the PZ-PA data, we used a second round of particle picking (’blob picker’ in CryoSPARC™) to ac­ count for the globular-like structure seen in the data and to ignore the filament states. The resulting 3D structure of this population state is shown in Fig. 11, with projections extending off the central hub in a nonuniform fashion.
The resulting cryoEM structures are in the low-resolution range, limiting the possibility of building atomistic models into the density. However, the resulting density envelope produced in these re­ constructions can be compared to SAXS data, allowing for orthogonal assessments of polymer systems. Both methodologies reveal the diam­ eter of the worm-like structures to be around 25 Å. However, the con­ tour length of the complexes estimated using the SAXS (∼ 1000 Å) and the EM (∼ 100 Å) differ, most probably due to the differences in the concentrations of the solutions probed using the two techniques. Also, EM revealed the emergence of a secondary state in the PZ-PA mixture that was not seen in PA alone. While coacervation was not seen in these samples, it is clear that at least two population states exist in the PZ-PA samples. What remains unclear is the structure of PZ alone, given that we were unable to image the PZ samples. However, given that the PZ sample behaves differently during the vitrification process (e.g., high affinity for the carbon grid) it is clear that complexation alters some chemical properties of the sample.
Some points of caution should be considered when interpreting this

data. First, the PA and PZ-PA samples adopted a preferred orientation, with the predominant views being along the long axis and limited numbers of end-on views. Missing information from the end-on pro­ jections can cause problems for any structure interpretation along that axis [47]. Second, a minimal number of micrographs (590 micrographs for PA and 320 micrographs for PZ-PA) and particles (less than 100 K per reconstruction) were used relative to the biological field [48]. This also limits the structural information obtained in these experiments. Finally, polymers of interest can result in either missing data related to the structure or low-resolution reconstructions [43]; therefore, it may never be possible to get information in the sub 5 Å range, which is necessary for atomistic model building typically seen in the biological field for these polymers. However, this work does show the benefit of employing biological EM methodologies for soft matter materials, provided caution is taken in the data processing and results interpretation stage. Future soft-matter experiments should take advantage of these methods where possible to analyze their polymers of interest in the hydrated (or sol­ vated) functional state.
3. Conclusions
Solutions containing polyzwitterions can exhibit either liquid–liquid phase separation or remain one-phase but show high viscosity, when mixed with polycations and polyanions, respectively. In either case, polyzwitterions tend to form complexes with polyelectrolytes. However, the coacervation is mainly observed on mixing the solutions of the polyzwitterions and the polycations. In contrast, mixing the solutions of the polyzwitterions and the polyanions doesn’t exhibit coacervation. Instead, metastable viscous fluids are obtained and the high viscosity results from the underlying complexation of the chains. One way to avoid the metastable one-phase is to dissolve solid mixtures of the polymers in water instead of mixing solutions containing individual polymers. These results clearly show that the chemical specificity plays an important role in affecting the coacervation. Here, we have hypoth­ esized the entropy gain due to the solvent reorganization as a molecular mechanism leading to the coacervation. Future works should focus on such molecular processes leading to the chemical specificity, which can

be leveraged for many applications involving filtration, drug delivery, and anti-microbial surfaces. For example, changing orientations of the dipoles on zwitterionic monomers such as in choline phosphate and phosphorylcholine [49]; and understanding its effects on complexation and coacervation when mixed with polyelectrolytes can shed more light on the chemical specificity. Furthermore, the viscous solutions of the polyzwitterions and the polyanions are responsive to salt and tempera­ ture, exhibit strain-softening and are promising materials for future applications. We envision the use of polyzwitterion based complexes and coacervates in the preparation of next generation of membranes and anti-fouling materials.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Materials
All reagents were used as received from suppliers without further purification unless otherwise noted. [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyl-(3- sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide (DMAPS), PDADMAC (Mn ∼200 K) and NaPSS (Mn ∼200 K) were purchased from Sigma­ –Aldrich. Deionized (DI) water of 18.2 MΩ cm (Millipore) was used throughout this work.
4.2. Synthesis of the polyzwitterions
To obtain polyzwitterions with 100% of pendant groups of zwitter­ ions, [2- (methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide (DMAPS) was polymerized by free radical polymerization using recrystallized 2,2’-Azobis (2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) as the initiator. In a typical procedure, DMAPS (50.0 g, 178.99 mmol, 118 eq), AIBN (0.25 g, 1.52 mmol, 1 eq), and 550 mL of deionized water were added into a 1 L flask under the inert atmosphere. Degassing was per­ formed by bubbling with nitrogen for at least 30 min. After stirring at 60 ◦C for 4 h, the reaction was quenched in the liquid nitrogen, followed by precipitation in cold ethanol to afford white solids as the pure products. (70 % yield).
4.3. Preparation of coacervates and other mixtures
PSBMA solid was dissolved into water with the addition of KBr and/ or heat (100 ◦C). The 20 wt% PDADMAC solution and 30 wt% PSS so­ lution were diluted using either KBr solution or water and were used as stocking solutions with designated polymer and salt concentration. For preparing polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte coacervates, two polymer stocking solutions containing the same polymer and salt concentration and volume were mixed and briefly vortexed at room temperature. Note that for preparing coacervates using high concentration of the polymers (especially 250 mg/mL PZ-250 mg/mL PA-H2O), the stocking solutions were heated and mixed at 100 ◦C. The resulting mixture was stored at room temperature.
We have prepared coacervates for the PZ-PA blends by using a different mixing protocol. First, we freeze-dried NaPSS solutions to obtain the solid NaPSS. Then, we added all solid materials including the PSBMA, the NaPSS, and the salt into a vial. Subsequently, we added water to the desired concentrations. The obtained solutions were initially vortexed and then stored at room temperature.
4.4. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
Both, the PZ-PC and the PZ-PA samples were prepared the same way. Specifically, 100 μl of the polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte mixture was drop-casted onto a cleaned silicon wafer (size: 1 × 2 cm). The samples were dried under ambient environment for several days before SEM measurements. The coating-free SEM samples were imaged using SNE4500 M Plus or Zeiss Merlin Scanning Electron Microscope at 1–5 kV for reduced electrostatic charging and electron beam damage to the

polymer films.

4.5. Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)
The polyzwitterion and polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte mixtures were characterized using a laboratory based Xenocs Xeuss 3.0 instru­ ment equipped with a D2 + MetalJet X-ray source (GaKα, 9.2 keV, λ = 1.341 Å). The polymer solutions were filled into 2.0 mm quartz capil­ laries (HR6-126, Hampton Research) and sealed with epoxy. The cap­ illaries were placed vertically in the X-ray beam (transmission mode). The scattered beam was recorded on a Dectris Eiger 2R 4 M hybrid photon counting detector with a pixel dimension of 75 × 75 μm2. The sample-to-detector distance for SAXS was calibrated using Silver Behenate (AgBeh) standard, which was 1750 mm and the exposure time was 600 s. The collected 2- dimensional (2D) SAXS images were circu­ larly averaged and expressed as absolute intensity versus scattering vector q, where q = (4πsinθ)/λ with θ and λ being the half of scattering angle and X-ray beam wavelength, respectively. All the data were cor­ rected for X-ray beam transmission, X-ray beam path length in solution, detector background and the absolute intensity calibration was achieved by direct beam measurement.

4.6. Rheology
Rheological measurements of the PZ-PA mixtures were performed on a DHR2 rheometer (TA Instruments) at two temperatures, 4◦C and 20◦C, with a 20 mm diameter parallel plate and Peltier temperature control base. To evaluate the linear viscoelastic properties, small-amplitude oscillatory shear was imposed in the angular frequency (ω) range of 0.1–100 rad/s with 1–2% strain. To probe the nonlinear rheological behavior, amplitude sweep measurements were carried out at ω = 1 rad/s in the strain range of 1–1000%.

4.7. Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (CryoEM)
4.7.1. Sample Preparation Three samples, PA at 5 mg/mL, PZ at 5 mg/mL, and PZ-PA blend at
2.5 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL, were prepared for analysis. Gold Quanti­ foil® 2/2 grids were glow discharged in a Quorum GloQube® system and loaded into a Vitrobot Mark IV system preequilibrated to 100% humidity at 4 ◦C. For each sample 5 μl of liquid was deposited on the grids, blotted for 6 s with a blot force of − 5, and immediately plunged into nitrogen-cooled ethane to produce a thin layer of vitreous ice. Samples were clipped into autoloader cartridges, loaded into a cassette, and inserted into a Krios G4 (S/TEM) microscope operating at 300kEV and liquid nitrogen temperatures in the ORNL’s CNMS facility.
4.7.2. Data collection Each sample was evaluated to measure ice thickness, potential
contamination (e.g., crystalline ice), and any potential devitrification. Here, we noticed that PZ showed preferential for the carbon support grid, and further processing of PZ was halted. We continued with the PA and PZ-PA samples that showed thin, vitreous ice and good particle distribution. We collected data using ThermoFisher’s EPU software to mitigate dose and allow for automated collection as seen in biological methodologies. Briefly, we used a defocus range from − 0.5 μm to − 4.0 μm, the Falcon3EC in counting mode with dose fractionation turned on, a total dose of 50 e/˚A2, and a pixel size of 0.85 Å/pixel. The total number of micrographs for each data set was 590 for PA and 320 for PZ. These micrographs were motion-corrected using MotionCor2 [46], CTFcorrected using CTFFIND4 [45], and denoised using Topaz denoising [44] all within the CryoSPARC [43] environment.
4.7.3. Reconstruction For the PA and PZ-PA data, a template-free filament tracer was used

for particle picking with a filament diameter of 15 Å, separation of 1, and minimum length to consider of 2 Å. Data was analyzed, and bad picks were discarded. Particles were extracted with a box size of 324 pixels and separated using 2D classification of filament classes aligned vertically to discard ’junk’ particles. An initial volume was generated from selected particles using ab- initio reconstruction, with a final vol­ ume generated by a series of non-uniform refinements. Symmetry was not imposed at any point in the reconstruction. Since the filament tracing options for the PZ-PA sample revealed a more ’particle-like’ structure was also present, the PZ-PA micrographs were processed using the ’blob-picker’ option in CryoSPARC™ with the particle diameters set between 40–110 Å. Picks were again inspected, extracted, classified, and reconstructed as previously mentioned.
