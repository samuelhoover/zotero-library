rug design is central to the discovery of a new medicine, as the drug molecule embodies the therapeutic hypothesis of a drug discovery program and encodes the properties, pharmacology, and safety of the medicine. During the design process, medicinal chemists endeavor to integrate existing knowledge and the insights generated during a drug discovery program into a molecule that achieves the target
product profile of the medicine.1 Following the development of
“rational drug design” in the mid-20th century,2 subsequent advances in drug design over the ensuing decades have included quantitative structure−activity relationships
(QSARs),3 ligand-based drug design,4 computer-aided drug
design,5 structure-based drug design,6 property-based drug
design,7 hypothesis-driven drug design,8 and approaches harnessing artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/
ML).9 Despite this progress, and myriad other drug discoveryrelated advances, some degree of serendipity is often still needed for successful drug discovery, as drug design remains a complex multiparameter optimization challenge and no single approach is a panacea. Modern drug design requires the strategic and integrated use of multiple approaches, which has
been referred to as holistic drug design.10,11 Among the above advancements, the advent of propertybased drug design stands out as an inflection point in the
evolution of small molecule drug development.12 Propertybased drug design is the careful consideration and modulation of molecular and physicochemical properties to optimize the pharmacological and safety profiles of drug molecules, including pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and toxicokinetic
properties.7 The term “property-based design”, as defined in the landmark Perspective by van de Waterbeemd and coauthors, was intended to encompass the variety of design approaches that had been developed up to the time of its
publication in 2001.7 This Editorial is intended to highlight what we believe are the most significant developments in the evolution of property-based drug design and to draw attention to the impact it has had on oral small molecule drug discovery since its genesis over 25 years ago. This Editorial is not intended to be a comprehensive review nor a detailed analysis of property-based drug design. Property-based drug design, combined with other drug design approaches and drug discovery-related scientific and technical advances, has enabled the development of more novel and complex oral small
molecule drugs,13−15 the pursuit of more challenging therapeutic targets, and the treatment of more complicated
diseases (Figure 1).16 We believe the impact property-based drug design has had on the development of medicines and the improvement of human health is worthy of a Nobel Prize.

EVOLUTION OF PROPERTY-BASED DRUG DESIGN
The development of QSAR by Corwin H. Hansch and collaborators in the 1960s contributed significantly to how medicinal chemists understand the relationships between chemical structure, physicochemical properties, and biological
activity.3 Most importantly, the efforts of Hansch and coworkers created greater awareness among medicinal chemists of the importance of controlling lipophilicity in drug
design,17,18 culminating in the concept of minimal hydro
phobicity (MH) in 1987.19 The core principle of MH is that drugs should be designed to be as hydrophilic as possible without the loss of activity unless there is convincing evidence to the contrary. In 1995, Hansch and co-authors published two books that served to summarize three decades of work on the
development and use of QSAR.20,21 By this time, in vitro highthroughput screening (HTS) and combinatorial chemistryderived screening libraries had become the dominant approaches to hit identification. A focus on optimizing the in vitro activity of the hits and leads emerging from these sources and a movement away from in vivo primary screening led to a decline in attention to molecular and physicochemical properties in drug design. Christopher A. Lipinski and co-workers believed these changes in drug discovery practices increased the challenge of designing orally active compounds, because in vitro HTSderived hits and leads tended to have higher molecular weights and lipophilicities and consequently lower aqueous solubilities
than pre-HTS era hit and lead compounds.22 As a response to these trends, Lipinski and co-workers reported the develop
ment of the rule of 5 (Rof5) in 1997 (Figure 1).22 This seminal publication led medicinal chemists to reconsider the relationships between molecular and physicochemical properties and oral bioavailability and launched the modern era of propertybased drug design. Stemming from an analysis of approved drugs and investigational drugs that had progressed to Phase 2
clinical trials,23 the Rof5 predicts that a compound is more likely to have poor absorption or permeation when exceeding the following parameter values: molecular weight (MW) > 500 Da, calculated logarithm of the octanol−water partition coefficient (cLogP) > 5, hydrogen bond donor (HBD; NH and OH bonds) count > 5, or hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA;

N and O atoms) count > 10. In this analysis, they found that only ∼10% of approved drugs and investigational drugs that had progressed to Phase 2 clinical trials and met their selection criteria exceeded any one of these parameter values, or most combinations of two of the four parameter values. Polypeptides were excluded from this analysis and compound classes that are substrates for biological transporters were described as exceptions to the Rof5 (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, vitamins, and cardiac glycosides). A compound exceeding two or more of these four parameter values was deemed to violate the Rof5 and was flagged as a risk for poor absorption or permeation. Another rules-based approach to property-based drug design was developed by Veber and co-workers in 2002, and is
generally referred to as Veber’s rules (VRs).24 Based on an analysis of the oral bioavailability of clinical candidates in
rats,25 VRs predict that a compound is more likely to have acceptable oral bioavailability when meeting the following two parameter values: rotatable bond (RB) count ≤ 10 and topological polar surface area (TPSA) ≤ 140 Å2 (or a HBD and HBA count ≤ 12). Although there has been much criticism of the Rof5 and other rules-based approaches to property-based drug design, the Rof5 has stood the test of time, as ∼90% of oral small molecule drugs still comply with
these guidelines.26−28 It is important to point out that Lipinski and co-workers did not suggest that small molecules violating the Rof5 cannot be orally active, only that they are less likely to be orally bioavailable. They noted that ∼10% of approved drugs and investigational drugs that had progressed to Phase 2 clinical trials and met their selection criteria violated the Rof5. Lipophilic efficiency (LipE), also referred to as lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE), developed by Leeson and Springthorpe and published in 2007, was an early example of a new composite metrics-based approach to property-based drug design, and gave medicinal chemists a new principle to understand how physicochemical properties impact potency,
selectivity, and safety (Figure 1; LipE = pIC50 − cLogP).29,30 LipE can be seen as a quantitative formulation of the MH principle developed by Hansch and co-workers and discussed previously. Emerging from an analysis of approved drugs, this rubric predicts a compound is more likely to be clinically developable when LipE > 5. LipE and other composite metricsbased approaches to property-based drug design evolved from the original ligand efficiency (LE) metric developed by Hopkins and co-workers in 2004, which is a ratio of the free energy of binding (ΔGbinding) and the number of non-hydrogen
atoms (NnH) of a ligand (LE = ΔGbinding/NnH).31 Based on an analysis of internal corporate screening data, LE predicts the best hit or lead compounds to pursue are those with the highest LE value. The mathematical validity of many composite metrics-based approaches to property-based drug design has been questioned; however, LipE has proven its
lasting value as a measure of compound quality.32−34

Lovering and co-workers reported the development of
fraction sp3 (Fsp3) in 2009 (Figure 1; Fsp3 = number of sp3
hybridized carbon atoms/total carbon atom count).35 Fsp3 represented a new individual property-based approach that provided a novel way for medicinal chemists to assess and exploit molecular shape to affect pharmaceutical properties and developability. Stemming from an analysis of discovery compounds, investigational drugs, and approved drugs, Fsp3 predicts a discovery compound is more likely to become a drug when Fsp3 > 0.40. This observation was ascribed to increased Fsp3 leading to increased aqueous solubility, a critical physiochemical property for successful drug discovery. A contemporaneous analysis of the effect of aromatic ring (AR) count on compound developability was reported by Macdon
ald and Ritchie in 2009.36 Based on an analysis of an internal corporate compound collection, AR count predicts that a compound is more likely to become a drug when AR count ≤ 3, which was attributed to increased AR count leading to decreased aqueous solubility. Much like the Rof5 and LipE, Fsp3 has proven to be enduringly useful for the design of
compounds with improved chances of clinical success.37 Many additional approaches to property-based drug design have been developed since the advent of the Rof5 in 1997 and we have highlighted what we believe are the most significant developments to date. Other notable approaches to propertybased drug design are included in Figure 1. The central nervous system multiparameter optimization (CNS MPO) algorithm developed by Wager and co-workers in 2010 was the first example of an MPO score-based approach to property
based drug design.38 The CNS MPO algorithm combines cLogP, cLogD, TPSA, MW, HBD, and pKa, and predicts a compound is more likely to have favorable CNS penetration and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), and safety profiles when CNS MPO score ≥ 4. The property forecast index (PFI) developed by Young and co-workers in 2011 (PFI = chromatographic log D7.4 + AR count) predicts a compound is more likely to have good developability when PFI
< 7.39 Finally, the beyond Rof5 (bRof5) property space analysis, published by Kihlberg and co-workers in 2014, predicts that oral bioavailability risks for compounds in this property space can be mitigated by implementing design
tactics such as intramolecular hydrogen bonding and macrocyclization or the use of alternate formulations and moderate
to high dosage.40 New approaches to property-based drug
design continue to be developed;41 however, their impact and durability remain to be seen. Property-based drug design approaches developed to date can be organized into six categories: individual properties, property−activity relationships, sets of rules, composite metrics, MPO scores, and AI/ML models (Figure 2). As drug design remains a complex multiparameter optimization challenge and no single approach is a panacea, modern property-based drug design requires the strategic and integrated use of multiple approaches. Property-based drug design is best approached as chemical series-specific, relative, and probabilistic (i.e., for a given chemical series, a relative change in a molecular or physicochemical property will have some probability of improvement in a pharmacological or safety property). Contemporary computational tools have made modern property-based drug design more accessible to medicinal chemists and have contributed to its widespread adoption; however, measured, rather than calculated, molecular and physicochemical properties should be used whenever practicable. A holistic approach to property-based drug design for a chemical series requires one to consider the following: 1.) individual properties to focus design hypotheses and proposals; 2.) property−activity relationships to inspire, validate, or invalidate design hypotheses; 3.) sets of rules as guidelines to assess the property space risk of design proposals; and 4.) composite metrics, MPO scores, and ADME-related AI/ML models to further assess the risk and quality of design
proposals.42 Ultimately, medicinal chemists must follow the structure−activity relationship (SAR) data for a chemical series and adapt their property-based drug design approach as needed.

IMPACT OF PROPERTY-BASED DRUG DESIGN
Medicinal chemists now leverage property-based drug design as an integral part of their multiparameter optimization efforts
in modern small molecule drug discovery.10,43 The ubiquity of property-based drug design is clearly seen in the number of citations for select property-based drug design publications as

shown in Figure 3. Based on a citation search using SciFinder (accessed on June 7, 2024), Lipinski’s Rof5, Leeson’s LipE, and Lovering’s Fsp3 publications have garnered 20156, 1848,
and 2688 citations, respectively.22,29,35 These property-based drug design approaches have contributed to the development of numerous oral small molecule drugs; some examples of approved drugs for which these approaches have been cited as design considerations are highlighted in Figure 4 along with their therapeutic targets and year of first approval. The Rof5 and the four parameters it includes have been ingrained as drug design considerations since their publication in 1997 and were recently reported to be key factors in the design of futibatinib, a covalent inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptors 1−4 (FGFR 1−4) for previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.44 LipE was reported to be a consideration in the design of several approved drugs: 1.) crizotinib, a dual inhibitor of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-Met) and ana
plastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, relapsed or refractory, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and unresectable, recurrent, or refractory
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors;45 2.) lorlatinib, a macrocyclic dual inhibitor of ALK and c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) for refractory and metastatic non-small-cell lung
cancer;46 3.) vonoprazan, an inhibitor of gastric hydrogen
potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) for erosive esophagitis
and add-on therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection;47 4.) osimertinib, a covalent inhibitor of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer;48 and 5.) fezolinetant, an antagonist of the neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R) for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to
menopause.49 Fsp3 was cited as a consideration in the design of fezolinetant as well as a number of other approved drugs: 1.) daclatasvir, an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus nonstructural 5A protein (HCV NS5A) replication complex for chronic
HCV genotype 1 or 3 infections;50 2.) delgocitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1−3 (JAK 1−3) and tyrosine kinase
2 (TYK2) for atopic dermatitis;51 and 3.) pemigatinib, an inhibitor of FGFR 1−3 for relapsed or refractory myeloid/ lymphoid neoplasms and previously treated, unresectable
locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.52 As these examples illustrate, property-based drug design has contributed to the development of more novel and complex oral small molecule drugs, the pursuit of more challenging therapeutic targets, and the treatment of more complicated diseases.

CONCLUSION
The 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James W. Black, Gertrude B. Elion, and George H. Hitchings for their development of “important principles for drug treatment”, often referred to as “rational drug design”. While drug discovery had earlier largely stemmed from chemical modification of natural products, they introduced a more rational approach based on the understanding of fundamental biochemical and physiological processes. This Nobel Prize is the only one awarded to date for an approach to drug design and discovery, and the only Nobel Prize awarded to a medicinal chemist (Gertrude B. Elion) since the establishment of the foundational principles of medicinal chemistry by the physician-scientist Paul Ehrlich in the early 1900s. These facts are striking, given that innovative drug design by medicinal chemists is central to the discovery of a new medicine, as the drug molecule not only embodies the therapeutic hypothesis of a drug discovery program, but also encodes the properties, pharmacology, and safety of the medicine. We believe that property-based drug design, used in concert with other drug design approaches and other drug discovery-related advances, has enabled the development of more novel and complex oral small molecule drugs, the pursuit of more challenging therapeutic targets, and the treatment of more complicated diseases. We propose that a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine should be awarded for property-based drug design, with Christopher A. Lipinski, Paul D. Leeson, and Frank Lovering as the proposed recipients for their development of “important principles for drug design”, principles that have contributed to the development of numerous approved drugs. While drug design previously focused primarily on optimizing potency, they introduced a more holistic approach based on the

consideration of how fundamental molecular and physicochemical properties affect pharmaceutical, pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and safety properties. The development of the Rof5 by Christopher A. Lipinski in 1997 introduced a new principle for how molecular and physicochemical properties affect oral bioavailability. The development of LipE by Paul D. Leeson in 2007 introduced a new principle for how physicochemical properties impact potency, selectivity, and safety. Finally, the development of Fsp3 by Frank Lovering in 2009 introduced a new principle for how molecular shape affects pharmaceutical properties and developability. We acknowledge our proposal may spark some debate, yet it is crucial for both the drug discovery community and the general public to recognize that “chemists invent drugs and drugs save
lives”.53 And what better way to do that than with a Nobel Prize?

Discovery of a Janus kinase inhibitor bearing a highly three-dimensional spiro scaffold: JTE-052 (delgocitinib) as a new dermatological agent to treat inflammatory skin disorders. J. Med. Chem. 2020, 63, 7163−7185. A focus on increasing molecular complexity and three-dimensionality in the design of delgocitinib for improved target specificity was done without explicit consideration of Fsp3, but the favorably high Fsp3 value of delgocitinib versus marketed drugs was acknowledged retrospectively. A topical formulation of delgocitinib is approved in Japan for atopic dermatitis; an oral formulation is in clinical development for hypersensitivity and autoimmune disorders.
