Familial parkinsonism and dementia with cortical and subcortical Lewy bodies is uncommon, and no genetic defect has been reported in the previously described sibships. We present a Spanish family with autosomal dominant parkinsonism, dementia, and visual hallucinations of variable severity. The postmortem examination showed atrophy of the substantia nigra, lack of Alzheimer pathology, and numerous Lewy bodies which were immunoreactive to -synuclein and ubiquitin in cortical and subcortical areas. Sequencing of the -synuclein gene showed a novel, nonconservative E46K mutation in heterozygosis. The E46K mutation was present in all affected family members and in three young asymptomatic subjects, but it was absent in healthy and pathological controls. The novel mutation, that substitutes a dicarboxylic amino acid, glutamic acid, with a basic amino acid such as lysine in a much conserved area of the protein, is likely to produce severe disturbance of protein function. Our data show that, in addition to the previously described hereditary -synucleinopathies, dementia with Lewy bodies is related to mutation of -synuclein.

Familial parkinsonism accounts for a significant proportion of cases of Parkinson’s disease (PD)1–3 and is related to several genetic defects that are inherited in a dominant4–12 or recessive pattern.13–16 The genes responsible for familial parkinsonism are not yet fully known, although several loci have been identified in the last few years.4–16 The clinical phenotype presented by patients with familial parkinsonism is variable. Not infrequently, in addition to the typical parkinsonian symptoms of PD, many of these patients present other deficits including dystonia, dysautonomia, cognitive and behavioral changes, sleep disorders, and perceptive deficits. Dementia is not uncommon in patients with PD, both sporadic and familial. It was present in some patients of the Contursi family, with the A53T mutation of -synuclein4,17 and in families with mutations of the tau gene.18–21 In PD, whether sporadic or familial, the most common form of dementia is dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in neocortical and paralimbic areas, and Alzheimer-type lesions.22–27 DLB is an heterogeneous
disorder with variable clinical and pathological features typically characterized by dementia, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognition and attention28,29 associated with the presence of Lewy bodies in a pattern more widespread than that usually observed in the brain nuclei of patients with PD. The clinical diagnostic criteria of DLB proposed by an international consortium includes the presence of cognitive decline plus at least two of the following: (1) spontaneous parkinsonian symptoms and signs, (2) visual hallucinations, and (3) fluctuations in consciousness early in the course of the disease.28,29 These criteria have high specificity but low sensitivity for the diagnosis of DLB, and the pathology remains the gold standard for the diagnosis.30 Recent studies have suggested that the density of LBs in certain brain regions, such as the parahippocampus and the cortical areas, correlates well with the presence of dementia.27,30 The cause of DLB is likely to be related to multiple causes. Most cases are sporadic but familial cases have been described.31–38 Genetic investigation of familial DLB has been very limited, and so far negative. Here,

we report a family from the Basque Country with autosomal dominant parkinsonism, possible/probable clinical criteria, and typical pathological features of DLB, produced by a novel mutation of -synuclein gene (SNCA). This mutation has not been found in the control population or in other patients with familial and sporadic parkinsonism, DLB, or dementia.
Patients and Methods
Clinical Investigation of the Original Family
A simplified version of the pedigree is presented in Figure 1. The hereditary pattern is definitely autosomal dominant. For confidentiality reasons, all members of this family are depicted, regardless of their sex, by a diamond. The ancestors of Patient I-1 are unknown. In the second generation, five of eight siblings (Cases II-2, II-4, II-6, II-10, and II-15) were affected according to the family informants, and all of them had transmitted the disease to their progeny. No medical records from any of these possible affected members were available. Case II-7 was a single woman without children and she died asymptomatic at 65 years of age. Case II-8, an obligate carrier of the mutation, died from cancer at 61 years of age without neurological symptoms. Case II-12 died asymptomatic when he was 62 years old, and none of his children have suffered the disease. We have personally examined four of the seven affected members in the third generation (Cases III-25, III-34, III38, and III-39) and the only known symptomatic member of the fourth generation (Case IV-28). The clinical summaries of these five affected subjects are provided below.
Histopathological Studies
The brain of the proband (Case III-34), extracted after death, was immersed in formalin. After fixation 22 blocks were taken from representative cortical and subcortical areas according to standardized protocols.28 The paraffinembedded sections were stained with routine histological methods and processed for immunocytochemistry with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (1/5,000; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), phosphorylated neurofilaments (1/40;
Zymed, San Francisco, CA), tau (1/400; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), ubiquitin (Z0458,1/400; Dako), and -synuclein (1/ 200, without formic acid pretreatment; Zymed).
Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography Studies
After informed consent a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)–FP-cit was obtained in Patient IV-28 and in two asymptomatic children of the proband, aged 37 and 41 years. A tomographic brain study with a Siemens double-head gamma-camera was performed after intravenous injection of 185 MBq (2.5 mCi) of 123iodoflupane (2betacarbomethoxy-3beta-[4-iodophenyl]-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortropane (FP-CIT) as described.39
Clinical and Pathological Criteria for Diagnosis
The clinical diagnosis of DLB was made according to international criteria28,29 that require the presence of progressive cognitive decline plus at least two of the following: (1) idiopathic parkinsonism, (2) visual hallucinations, and (3) fluctuations in consciousness early in the course of the disease. The pathological criteria were those of the international consortium28,29 modified according to Harding and Halliday,30 namely, the presence of a high density of LBs, greater than 3/200 magnification field in the parahippocampus, and the absence of Alzheimer-type pathology. The diagnosis of PD was made in accord with the recommendations of the London Brain Bank.40
Genetic Studies
Informed consent was obtained from patients, members of their families, and control subjects according to the ethical requirements of the Clinical Research Committee, Fundacio ́n Jim ́enez Dı ́az, Madrid. Genomic DNA was isolated either from peripheral leukocytes by standard phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation methods or from embedded brain tissue adding xylene to remove the paraffin and using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based methods were used for the molecular analysis.39 Park1 exons were amplified using

the oligonucleotides primer pairs described in Table 1. Some of these primers were selected according to previous reports6,8 and others according to National Center for Biotechnology Information database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Amplification reactions were performed by means of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA) in a final volume of 25l by use 250ng of genomic DNA. The MgCl2 concentration (1.5–1.75mM) and annealing temperature (50 –55°C) were optimized when necessary. After initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 minutes, amplification was performed through 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, the annealing temperature for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 45 seconds, for extension. After a final 10-minute extension at 72°C, the amplified products of Park1 exons 2 and 3 (previously referred to as 3 and 46,8) were subjected to direct sequencing in the index case with the same primers used for amplification, using a fluorescence-based automated sequencing technique (Applied Biosystem 373a DNA sequencer, Perkin-Elmer Model). Exons 4 and 5 and coding region of exon 6 of the Park-1 gene were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis using the Genephor System (Amersham, Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) at both 5 and 15°C according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. PCR products were digested using StyI enzyme (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols. After digestion, the fragments were electrophoresed on a 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 150V for 2 hours and visualized by silver staining with the PlusOne DNA Silver Staining Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Selection of Controls and Other Clinical Cases
In addition to the original family, we included seven DLB families from different regions of Spain, 22 sporadic DLB cases (20 of them confirmed by pathology), 34 patients with other neurological disorders, and 213 healthy controls from blood banks.
Results
Retrospective Clinical Data
We questioned the relatives of the eight deceased cases whom we had not personally examined about their
clinical picture, namely, the presence of tremor, disability, visual hallucinations, or dementia. The response to L-dopa could not be evaluated because all had died before this drug was available. Age at onset of the disease ranged from 50 to 65 years, and age at death from 64 to 75 years. One patient had died early at age 63 years from cancer. Mild tremor at rest was present in approximately 50% of the patients. All the patients became wheelchair or bed bounded. Evaluation of dementia was difficult because of severe mutism and immobility but was probable as a late event in four of the eight cases. Two patients had presented vivid visual hallucinations.
Report of Representative Cases
PATIENT 1 (PROBAND, CASE III-34). Patient 1 was a 69
year-old man, who had noticed tremor in his right extremities, rigidity, generalized bradykinesia, and memory loss for 2 years before his first consultation and agitated nocturnal sleep for a long time. Examination showed a normal mental status with hypophonic speech, hypokinesia and rigidity in both arms, more severe in the right side, together with tremor at rest in the right hand. He had normal gait, balance, and coordination. The polysomnography showed a drastic reduction of sleep time, with only short periods of phase I of nonrapid eye movement sleep and absence of rapid eye movement sleep (detailed polysomnography results will be reported elsewhere). Blood counts and chemistries were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed nonspecific changes. The patient improved with L-dopa and selegiline but developed mild choreic dyskinesia and cognitive decline 2 years later. He was disoriented in time and place, his Mini-Mental State Examination was 16 of 30, his alertness fluctuated, and he had delusions, visual hallucinations that improved with risperidone, and confusion of reality. One year later, he had unexplained sudden falls. In January 2002, 8 years after disease onset, dementia was severe

and the patient was incontinent. He died of pneumonia in February 2002. An autopsy was performed. In summary, this man presented with nocturnal agitated insomnia for more than 10 years followed by a generalized parkinsonian syndrome with mild memory impairment for 7 years and a severe cognitive decline and hallucinations for 2 years.
PATIENT 2 (CASE III-25). Patient 2, a 67-year-old woman, was seen in November 1992 because of a 2-year history of bradykinesia for hand movements, and postural abnormalities with flexion of the trunk, and festination of gait. The patient was amimic, tremorless, with a marked flexion of the trunk, severe akinesia, and rigidity in the four limbs. Gait was slow but unaided, without arm swing but at a normal pace. Balance was preserved. She improved functionally with L-dopa and selegiline. Two years, later the patient developed memory problems, and when the dose of L-dopa was increased, mental confusion and visual hallucinations appeared. Her cognitive and motor deficits worsened progressively, and she died dependent for daily living activities at age 73 years.
PATIENT 3 (CASE III-38). Patient 3 was a 58-year-old woman who developed generalized bradykinesia with early flexion of the trunk and without tremor. Her motor deficits became worse during the following years despite treatment with L-dopa, bromocriptine, and selegiline. We examined her when she was 69 years old, and, in addition to her parkinsonian syndrome, she had fluctuating behavioral changes, mental confusion, disorientation, diurnal hypersomnia, confabulations, visual hallucinations and frequent falls. A neurological examination confirmed a fluctuating mental status. Changes of antiparkinsonian medication provided no benefit. After a hip replacement, her mental status deteriorated, she became confused and delirious, with restless sleep, confined to a wheelchair or bed, mute, and demented. She died in 2001.
PATIENT 4 (CASE III-39). Patient 4 was a 60-year-old woman who reported bradykinesia that prompted her early retirement. She was diagnosed as having PD and treated with L-dopa. The effects of the treatment are unknown but eventually she became unable to walk at around age 70 years. Two years later, her speech was unintelligible. She was placed in a nursing home at age 74 years, dependent for daily living activities [invalid] and demented, and she is still alive at age 78 years. She does not recognize her relatives or nurses, is double incontinent, and wheelchair bound. L-Dopa, 1,000mg/ day, does not modify her motor deficits now. She is moderately amimic. Spontaneous and automatic ocular movements are normal. Speech is unintelligible and she only produces some automatic utterances. She can
obey only inconsistently some simple commands (eg, raise your hand) or perform pronosupination movements of the hands. A mild postural tremor is present in both arms, slightly more marked on the left. Stance and walking are impossible.
PATIENT 5 (CASE IV-28). Patient 5 was a 50-year-old man who was seen in May 2001 for a 1-year history of diffuse discomfort and muscle rigidity in his right arm, shoulder, and lateral cervical region. He noticed a reduction of right arm swing during walking, and loss of manual dexterity for skillful movements such as writing, shaving, or using a computer mouse. He had no tremor. He felt sad and depressed and left his job transiently. The neurological examination disclosed amimia, reduced blinking and fixed stare, normal ocular movements, and hypophonic and monotonous speech. He had marked bradykinesia and moderate rigidity, and no tremor in the right limbs. Stretch reflexes and plantar responses were normal. He walked with a mild dragging of the right leg and reduced right arm swing. Balance was normal but some slowing of postural reflexes was observed. Mental status was considered normal. Routine blood and urine analyses and brain magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Treatment with selegiline and pergolide improved his motor and affective deficits and he resumed his job. At the beginning of 2003, he scored 27 and 20 in the United Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale–III in “off-drugs” on 2 consecutive days. A mild resting and postural tremor appeared in the upper extremities. Apomorphine, 2mg SC, reduced the motor score by 30%, and by 59% after a second challenge with 3mg. L-Dopa, 250mg PO, reduced the United Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale–III score by 15%, and by 57% at a dose of 375mg. A comprehensive neuropsychological examination gave results within normal limits, although the patient had some difficulties in learning the bases of classification in the Wisconsin Card Sorting test. He provided 39% of wrong answers, 19.5% due to perseveration, a score still normal but below the mean for his age and education. This result was considered suggestive of mild impairment in cognitive flexibility. A SPECT-FP-cit showed a clear reduction of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function on the left striatum more marked in the putamen, contralateral to the more symptomatic right limbs (Fig 2).
Pathological Findings
The macroscopic external examination of the brain was unremarkable. The brain weight after fixation was 1,400gm. A moderate pallor of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus was observed. The main microscopic finding with the routine histological stains was a moderate to severe neuronal loss, microspongiosis, free and phagocyted neuromelanin, and reactive astrogliosis

in the substantia nigra. Some neuronal loss was present in locus coeruleus and was more severe in the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagus nerve. With the hematoxylin and eosin stain, abundant Lewy bodies of the classic type were observed in the substantia nigra, basal nucleus of Meynert, perifornical area, medullary and pontine tegmentum, periaqueductal gray matter, raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, area postrema, and dorsal motor
nuclei of the tenth nerve. Some pale bodies and axonal spheroids were present in the same structures. Many nonconcentric and some concentric LBs were observed in the anterior cingulated cortex (Fig 3B, C). Some bizarre inclusions (elongated or serpiginous) were detected in the pontine (see Fig 3D) and bulbar tegmentum and in the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagus nerve. Some scattered amyloid nonneuritic plaques were ob

served in the frontal neocortex. There were no plaques, tangles, or granulovacuolar degeneration in the hippocampal formation. There were no other relevant microscopic abnormalities with the routine stains in cortical or subcortical structures. The immunocytochemical methods against ubiquitin and -synuclein confirmed the presence of Lewy bodies in the above-mentioned structures (Fig 4). In addition, more axonal spheroids and many dystrophic neurites (Lewy neurites [LNs]) positive for ubiquitin and -synuclein were observed. A semiquantitative distribution of LBs, LNs, and axonal spheroids is presented in Table 2. In the hippocampal formation, there was a moderate to abundant deposit of LBs and LNs in the pyramidal layer (in all the sectors), but there was no immunoreactivity in the granular layer. The amyloid plaques in the neocortex showed a tiny granular staining for ubiquitin but were negative for tau immunoreactivity. There were no plaques or tangles in any area.
Molecular Findings
Sequence genomic DNA analysis of the different exons of Park1 gene of the index case failed to show any of the previously reported mutations but disclosed a single base pair change at position 188 from G to A (G188A)
relative to the published GenBank ID L08850 (Fig 5). G188A transition replaces the acidic polar glutamic residue with the basic polar lysine residue at position 46 (E46K) and abolishes a StyI restriction site (see Fig 6). Mutation screening for the G188A change in this family showed complete segregation with the DLB phenotype with the exception of the carriers of this mutation that are asymptomatic. Such individuals are younger than the other affected members. We performed haplotype analysis in the available members of the family using three microsatellite markers that mapped around the Park1 gene. This analysis identified a haplotype shared by E46K carriers (data not shown). We excluded the presence of another genetic lesion in addition to E46K by analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphism of the rest of the Park1 coding exons. We did not observe any band shift. The search for the G188A change in 276 Spanish healthy and pathological controls was negative.

most patients 2 or more years after disease onset, with late hallucinations at therapeutic doses of L-dopa, and fluctuations in the level of consciousness. The clinical features of these patients were more consistent with motor than with perceptive or cognitive deficits, at least in the initial stages of the disease. Cognitive decline, hallucinations, and fluctuations of consciousness appeared eventually in most but not all patients. The pathological findings were unambiguously consistent with DLB, because there was a high density of LBs present not only in the subcortical nuclei but also in the parahippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. No Alzheimer-type pathology was present.
Several clinicopathological syndromes such as DLB, pure autonomic failure, and behavioral disorder of rapid eye movement sleep share the same histological marker with PD, namely, the LB, but with different regional and cellular distribution. In these syndromes, the clinical symptoms are poor predictors of the pathology,30 and, in general, DLB is seen more frequently as a pathological finding than as a clinical diagnosis It is not clear how these syndromes with their different clinical phenomenology are related to synuclein pathology. In the absence of a proven common cause, the relationship between these syndromes, particularly between PD and DLB, is a matter of controversy due to clinical and pathological overlap. Approximately 30% of PD patients eventually develop dementia, and numerous LBs are found in their cortical and subcortical brain areas.24 On the other hand, a parkinsonian syndrome associated with cognitive impairment is a main clinical diagnostic criterion for DLB, and, in such cases, LBs are regularly found at autopsy in the substantia nigra. A consensus conference held in 1996 concluded that for pragmatic reasons it was appropriate to maintain PD and DLB as different clinicopathological syndromes.28 They suggested taking an arbitrary 12-month interval (later expanded to 24 months) between the beginning of motor symptoms and the cognitive decline as indicative of DLB, whereas they reserved the denomination of PD with dementia (PDD) for those cases in which the dementia occurs later in the course of the disease.29 The main reason for such a distinction is that, in PDD patients who develop dementia after many years of evolution, a confounding comorbidity with Alzheimer pathology is common.24,25 There are, however, patients with DLB who develop dementia more than 2 years after disease onset.
Fig 5. Genomic DNA sequencing corresponding to exon 3 of Park1 gene of the index case of this family showed a single base pair change at position 188 from G to A (G188A) that produces a nonconservative mutation, E46K, of the -synuclein protein.

The E46K Change Is a Pathogenic Mutation Responsible for Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Not a Polymorphism
The E46K change is a pathogenic mutation responsible for DLB in this family and not a polymorphism for the following reasons. (1) It cosegregated with the presence of clinical symptoms with the exception of the asymptomatic gene carriers who had not yet reached the expected age of onset. (2) It is not present in the control populations. (3) It involves an area of -synuclein that is well preserved during evolution. (4) It involves an area of -synuclein that is critical for the protein function. (5) It produces a nonconservative change of polarity in that area of the protein, substituting a dicarboxylic amino acid, glutamate, with a basic amino acid in one of the imperfect repeats KTKEGV, near the amino terminus, that are critical for the protein function. The first Park1 mutation, A53T, consists in the transversion at the nucleotide position 209 from guanine to adenine, resulting in the change of alanine to threonine in the mutant peptide. This mutation was found in a large Italian family and several Greek families.6 The other mutation in Park1, A30P, was identified in a PD German family and consists in the substitution of guanine to cytosine at position 88 of the coding sequence, causing the change of alanine to proline.8 These patients have typical L-dopa–responsive parkinsonism except for a relatively early age at onset.4 There is, however, phenotypic variability among patients, because, in the Contursi kindred, three of five patients whose clinical data were reported had dementia and one had visual hallucinations. Surprisingly, a recent review of the neuropathology in one of these brains reported that the density of LBs in the cortex was low but that there was extensive tau pathology,41 not present in our case.
The Mutation Now Described Greatly Interferes with Protein Function
Lewy bodies are mainly composed of misfolded -synuclein, a presynaptic protein of 140 amino acids that is abundant in the brain.42 An important characteristic of the -synuclein primary structure is the presence within the first 95 residues of imperfect repeats that bind synthetic unilamellar vesicles rich in acidic phospholipids, suggesting that it may be a lipid binding protein.42 Interestingly, both the A53T and the A30P lie in the repeat region of the molecule, and, although the mechanistic pathogenetic basis is not clear, it probably involves novel functions of the mutant filamentous -synuclein.41 There is an altered expression of synucleins in Lewy bodies, with increased levels of -synuclein mRNA and reduced levels of synuclein.43 Transgenic mice expressing wild-type human -synuclein present -synuclein and ubiquitinimmunoreactive intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions in their cortical neurons, fewer dopamine terminals in the striatum, and motor deficits.44 In addition to its nuclear and cytoplasmic function, -synuclein plays a role in the regulation of dopamine release at the presynaptic terminal. Mice lacking -synuclein had an increased liberation of dopamine.45 Human mesencephalic lines transfected with the A53T mutation present a reduced KCl- and an increased amphetamine-induced release of dopamine and accumulation of this neurotransmitter in the cytosol where dopamine could trigger excessive production of free radicals and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to cell death.46 The mutation now reported lies also in one of these imperfect repeats, but the radical change that it produces in the protein greatly modifies the polarity of the region. The impact of this change in protein function therefore is predicted

Our Findings Help to Include Dementia with Lewy Bodies in the Spectrum of Parkinson’s Disease
Because different mutations of the same gene could produce variable clinical phenotypes and with gradual severity of the pathology, our findings support a close relationship between DLB and PD. Both PD and DLB are caused by -synuclein pathology. Other familial cases of PD or DLB could be caused by other mutations of -synuclein. Therefore, in families with autosomal dominant PD or DLB, a full search for mutations in the Park-1 gene is warranted. Synucleinopathies, both genetic and sporadic, also could be related to mutations of other genes that code for proteins interacting with -synuclein in the case of familial disease, or to postranslational alterations of this protein in sporadic cases. Gwinn-Hardy and colleagues47 recently reported a family with patients affected by diseases ranging from Parkinson’s disease to dementia and psychosis linked to chromosome 4p15, a different locus from that of the -synuclein gene. They also had widespread synuclein pathology, from pleomorphic Lewy bodies to synuclein-positive glial inclusions and dystrophic neuritis. We recently have reported a case of pathologically confirmed progressive supranuclear palsy with hyperphosphorylation of protein tau associated with a mutation of the Park-2 gene, which occurred in a patient with a haplotype of risk for a tauopathy.48 In sporadic PD patients with -synuclein pathology, postranslational changes may be related to several mechanisms such as nitric oxide–related oxidation of tyrosine residues of -synuclein,49 abnormal aggregation related to excess of free radicals or inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain,50 abnormal -synuclein phosphorylation,51 and other putative alterations that should be investigated. Our study provides relevant data for understanding the pathogenesis of DLB. The investigation of the role of -synuclein and the effects of the new mutated molecule in cell function will provide the clues for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of these disorders and for developing rational neuroprotective strategies.
