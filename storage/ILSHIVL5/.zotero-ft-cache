ABSTRACT: The nanopore sensing method holds the promise of delivering a single molecule technology for identification of biological proteins, direct detection of post-translational modifications, and perhaps de novo determination of a protein’s amino acid sequence. The key quantity measured in such nanopore sensing experiments is the magnitude of the ionic current passing through a nanopore blocked by a polypeptide chain. Establishing a relationship between the amino acid sequence of a peptide fragment confined within a nanopore and the blockade current flowing through the nanopore remains a major challenge for realizing the nanopore protein sequencing. Using the results of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, here we compare nanopore sequencing of DNA with nanopore sequencing of proteins. We then delineate the factors affecting the blockade current modulation by the peptide sequence, showing that the current can be determined by (i) the steric footprint of an amino acid, (ii) its interactions with the pore wall, (iii) the local stretching of a polypeptide chain, and (iv) the local enhancement of the ion concentration at the nanopore constriction. We conclude with a brief discussion of the prospects for purely computational prediction of the blockade currents.

eading the amino acid sequence of individual proteins with high precision and throughput holds the promise of
delivering the most detailed portrait of a biological cell.1 In the absence of natural mechanisms to copy, read, or transcribe protein sequences, abiological approaches to protein sequenc
ing have taken a lead.2 While improving conventional protein
sequencing methods, such as Edman degradation3 and mass
spectrometry,4 has its merits, the ultimate advances may come
from nanopore sequencing,5 Figure 1a, a single molecule sensing tehcnique that, in the field of DNA sequencing, has
matured from a pipe dream to commercial enterprise.6 In a typical nanopore experiment, a nanopore is embedded in a thin, electrically insulating membrane separating a volume of electrolyte solution into two compartments connected by the nanopore. Electric field is applied across the membrane using two electrodes placed at the opposite sides of the membrane. In contrast to conventional gel electrophoresis, where the electric field is evenly distributed over the macroscopic distance between the electrodes, in a nanopore experiment, the field is focused to the vicinity of the
nanopore.7 The electric field extending from the nanopore entrance can bring a charged analyte molecule from the solution to the nanopore and then push the molecule through the nanopore to the other side of the membrane, transiently
reducing the ionic current flowing through the nanopore. Such ionic current blockades are measured experimentally and used to determine the chemical structure of the molecule. Early measurements of nanopore transport found DNA molecules to pass through the nanopores too quickly for the DNA sequence to be determined with a single nucleotide
resolution from the blockade current signatures.8,9 The solution to the DNA speeding problem came in the form of a DNA binding enzyme, which is too large to pass through the
nanopores.10 In addition to serving as a translocation stopper, the biological enzyme can perform a host of useful (for DNA sequencing) functions, most importantly to thread the DNA polymer through the nanopore in single nucleotide steps and to unzip double-stranded DNA. Combining the stepwise translocation of DNA enabled by the biological enzyme with

DNA nucleotides at a time in its constriction, has made
nanopore sequencing of DNA possible.12,13 Efforts to adopt the concept of nanopore DNA sequencing to protein sequencing have been ongoing starting with the
pioneering work that used either an unfoldase motor14 or a
DNA tag15 to thread and unfold native proteins through a biological nanopore α-hemolysin. But, in comparison to DNA sequencing, nanopore sequencing of proteins faces multiple challenges that stem from the chemical structure of a polypeptide chain. Under physiological conditions, a DNA strand carries a uniform electric charge of one electron per each phosphate backbone of its nucleotides, Figure 1b. A polypeptide’s backbone, however, is electrically neutral and the charge of a polypeptide chain is dictated by the charge of its side chains, Figure 1c. Thus, the force of the electric field alone may not be sufficient to capture and unidirectionally transport a polypeptide chain through a nanopore. Multiple solutions have been described to address this problem, which includes
the use of electro-osmotic16,17 or dielectrophoretic18 forces, or changing the charge of the polypeptide by either bathing a
protein in a detergent solution,19−21 changing pH of the
solution,22 and/or appending the proteins with charged
tags.15,21,23 Please see recent reviews for a complete account
of the literature.2,24,25 Another challenge�the main topic of this article�relates to identifying individual amino acids from the blockade current signature that a peptide strand makes when passing through a nanopore. Reading the DNA sequence boils down to identifying one of the four canonical DNA bases. Although the differences among the bases are small, Figure 1b, the similar chemical structure of the bases alleviates, to some degree, complications related to differential interactions with the nanopore surface, which as we show below, is not the case for polypeptides. More importantly, protein sequencing requires identification of the twenty amino acids, which can be done for individual
amino acids attached to the same polypeptide carrier26 or
transiently bound to a modified nanopore,27 but becomes a formidable challenge in the context of a random sequence background. Thus, a protein nanopore that confines four
nucleotides at a time can produce current levels from 44 = 256 possible nucleotide combinations, i.e., k-mers. The same nanopore will confine about seven amino acids at a time and
thus produce a total of 20 7 = 1.28 × 109 current levels. Taking into account the abundance and diversity of posttranslational
modifications,28 the latter number can be astronomically higher. Below, we use the results of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe four factors that determine a sequence-specific blockade current produced by a peptide transport through a nanopore. We show that, in addition to a
volume exclusion mechanism seen in the case of DNA,29 the blockade current is determined by at least three additional effects that stem from the heterogeniety of a polypeptide chain structure. While our work does not provide a solution to resolving the astronomical number of possible amino acid combinations that one would expect to encounter in de novo protein sequencing, it provides a framework for designing singal processing tools aiming at protein identification, detection of mutations, and post-translational modifications.

NANOPORE SEQUENCING OF DNA VERSUS NANOPORE SEQUENCING OF PROTEINS
Prior to describing the factors affecting the blockade current from peptide translocation, it is instructive to compare nanopore sequencing of DNA with nanopore sequencing of proteins under ideal circumstances, when both carry uniform negative charge. For the purpose of such comparison, we constructed a simulation system containing a DNA strand threaded through a truncated version of an MspA nanopore, a computationally efficient model that retains all essential
properties of a full length MspA system.29,30 Upon embedding the nanopore/DNA complex within a patch of a lipid membrane and solvating the system with 0.4 M KCl

A strand of a biopolymer�a nucleic acid or a polypeptide�is threaded through the nanopore. A transmembrane voltage is applied across the membrane, generating the flow of ions through the partially blocked nanopore. The motion of the biopolymer through the nanopore is controlled by the tug of war of the transmembrane electric field and the pull of a biological molecular motor. The ionic current fingerprint produced by the displacement of the biopolymer chain through the nanopore is used to decipher the nucleic or amino acid sequence of the biopolymer.

electrolyte, the system was simulated for 2 μs under a 180 mV transmembrane voltage while a harmonic potential restrained the position of the top DNA nucleotide, reproducing the anchoring action of a biological enzyme, Figure 2a. A second system was built and simulated under identical conditions featuring a polypeptide chain, Figure 2b. Both strands contained a chemically uniform and electrically charged sequence: poly(dT)14 in the case of the DNA and poly(D)18 in the case of the polypeptide. The lengths of the biopolymers were chosen to span, approximately, a similar distance along the nanopore axis under the same applied bias. Figure 2c,d plots the location of each monomer during a 2 μs simulation at 180 mV. The monomers of both biopolymers are seen to undergo stochastic displacement relative to the MspA constriction (located at z = 0). The displacement in both cases is coherent among the monomers of the same strand, which we attribute to their electric charge. Much less coherence is expected for a heterogeneous sequence peptide, as some amino acids do not carry a net electric charge and may interact specifically with the nanopore surface. The amplitude of the stochastic displacement, computed as the root mean squared displacement, is 2.3 Å for the DNA, four times larger than the average stochastic displacement of the polypeptide, 0.6 Å, which we attribute to the higher tension in the latter strand. Finally, the spacing among the consecutive monomers is noticeably greater in the DNA strand: 1.4 nucleotides are confined, on average, within the 8 Å length of the nanopore constriction, whereas 2.6 amino acid residues are confined within the same nanopore volume. The average intermonomer distance along the nanopore axis is thus 5.5 Å and 3.1 Å in the nanopore, which compares well with the 6.8 Å and 3.5 Å distances extracted from the respective chemical structures. Although both strands are negatively charged, they adopt statistically different conformations within the nanopore constriction. Thus, the backbone of a thymine nucleotide is
located, on average, 1.0 Å lower than the DNA base of the same nucleotide, Figure 2e, whereas the backbone of an aspartic amino acid is located, on average, 0.7 Å higher than its side chain, Figure 2f. These systematic differences in the local structure of the biopolymers at the nanopore constriction are caused by the differential localization of the electrical change within a nucleotide or a polypeptide monomer, Figure 1b,c. Knowing the coordinates of each atom in an MD simulation, we can compute the ionic current flowing through the nanopore from the instantaneous displacement of the
ions.31,32 Such raw current trances, however, are very noisy as they account for the thermal (stochastic) displacement of
ions.33 Averaging the instantaneous currents in 50 ns blocks and then dividing each block-average value by the average open pore current (determined from an additional simulation) reveals how the simulated blockade current changes over the course of the MD trajectory and how it depends on the biopolymer type, Figure 2g. In general agreement with experiment, the relative blockade current through MspA is about 2-fold larger when the pore is blocked by a charged
polypeptide strand,34 in comparison to a DNA strand under
similar conditions.12 Such a large difference cannot be fully explained by the difference in the steric footprints of the monomers, as the respective conductive volume of the nanopore constriction differs by only ∼10%, Figure 2h. Hereafter, a steric footprint of a molecule refers to the molecule’s ability to reduce the number of bulk-like water molecules when placed in a solution and, in practice, means the volume occupied by the molecule and its first solvation shell. We attribute the remaining difference of the blockade currents to the strong enhancement of ion concentration in the nanopore constriction, Figure 2i, caused by the higher charge density of the polypeptide strand. The difference in the local charge density can largely account for the 2-fold difference in

the effective force35 applied to the strands by the electric field in the nanopore, Figure 2j.
Determinants of Current Blockade: Steric Exclusion
Previously, we have shown that, in the case of DNA translocation, the ionic current blockade is determined by the conductive volume of the nanopore constriction and that the nucleotide sequence of the DNA modulates the blockade
current by altering the conductive volume of the nanopore.29 To determine if the same steric exclusion mechanism is at play in the peptide translocation case, we examined the current blockades produced by two uniformly charged polypeptides, poly(D)22 and poly(E)22, that differ solely by the presence of a single methylene group in each amino acid side chain, Figure 3a,b. In order to enhance sampling, we conducted four replica simulations for each system, anchoring the top residue of the strands at different locations above the nanopore, Figure 3c. Figure 3d plots the distribution of the relative blockade current obtained from the simulations of the poly(D)22 and poly(E)22 systems. The polypeptide chain containing larger amino acids (glutamic acid, E) is seen to block the current more, with the blockade current difference being about 6% of the absolute current value. Similar magnitude difference is observed when comparing the relative conductive volume of the nanopore constriction occupied by the poly(D) and poly(E) strands. Thus, the addition of a single methylene group to the side chain of an amino acid produces a small yet measurable decrease of the blockade current and the magnitude of such a decrease is quantitatively similar to the reduction of the nanopore conductive volume. Thus, steric
exclusion determines the blockade current not only in the so
called whole molecule sensing measurements,26,36 but also in strand sequencing of a polypeptide, a conjecture echoed by
recent experiments.37,38 The steric footprint is found to introduce a small yet statistically significant difference in the effective force acing on the polypeptides, with the bulkier side chains reducing the effective force, Figure 3f. The difference cannot be attributed
to the drag of the electro-osmotic flow35 as we did not observe a statistically significant difference in the average water flux through the nanopores, Figure 3g. We attribute the effective force difference to direct interactions between the polypeptide and the nanopore, Figure 3h, which was previously shown to considerably affect the effective force on DNA in a solid-state
nanopore.39 Note that the effective force on poly(D)22, Figure 3f, is only marginally higher than on poly(D)18, Figure 2j, because the majority of the electric field is focused at the nanopore constriction.
Determinants of Current Blockade: Interaction with the Nanopore Surface
A straightforward approach to controlling the nanopore transport of a charged polypeptide is to chemically link the polypeptide to a fragment of DNA and then use the already established methodology of stepping DNA through a nanopore
with the help of a DNA processing enzyme.34,40 This approach
has been demonstrated in the proof-of-concept experiments,34 where three polypeptide chains differing by a single amino acid substitution were pulled against the force of the electric field using a helicase motor, Figure 4a. The resulting ionic current

nontrivial manner: while the smaller amino acid, glycine (G) increased the ionic current relative to the baseline amino acid type (D), the largest amino acid�tryptophan (W)�could both decrease or increase the current, depending on its putative location relative to the nanopore constriction. Three sets of multicopy MD simulations have determined the molecular cause of such puzzling ionic current dependence. The displacement of a mixed-sequence (DE) polypeptide, Figure 4c, was found to produce no noticeable changes of the conductive volume of the nanopore, Figure 4f, and, hence, of
the ionic current.34 The passage of a glycine substitution through the nanopore constriction, Figure 4c, was accompanied by the transient increase of the conductive volume,
Figure 4f, and the ionic current,34 in accordance with the steric exclusion mechanism. For the tryptophan substitution, however, the conductive volume was first observed to decrease but then transiently increase as the substitution exists the nanopore constriction, Figure 4f. Further analysis showed that this transient increase is correlated with direct (hydrophobic) interaction of the tryptophan residue to the surface of the nanopore above the constriction, Figure 4g. This interaction reduced the effective footprint of the polypeptide in the nanopore by reducing the number of water molecule exposed to the combined surface of the nanopore and the peptide,
similar to the effects previously reported for DNA41 and
protein42 systems. Thus, specific interactions between the residues of the nanopore surface and the residues of the peptide can modulate the blockade current by altering the conductive volume of the nanopore.
Determinants of Current Blockade: Stretching and Ion Congregation
The vast majority of biological peptides are heterogeneous with regard to their local hydrophobicity and electrical charge. This heterogeneity becomes even more diverse when taking into account a large library of possible post-translational
modifications.28 One common modification is phosphorylation, which changes the charge of a modified amino acid. Nanopore detection of peptide phosphorylation has become possible in the broader context of nanopore sequencing by chemically linking both ends of a target peptide to two DNA fragments and using a helicase motor to move the peptide in
discrete steps through the nanopore constriction,23 Figure 5a. These experiments specifically examined βCAT peptides, which are of immunological significance to several health
conditions including cancers, Alzheimer’s, and heart diseases.28 Experimentally, phosphorylation of the two serine residues within the βCAT sequence was found to produce a pronounced increase of the blockade current, in comparison to the nonphosphorylated peptide variant, Figure 5b. This is a counterintuitive result as the addition of a phosphate group increases the steric footprint of the modified residue, which is expected to decrease the blockade current. We have identified the molecular mechanisms responsible for such a dramatic (almost 2-fold) increase of the ionic current upon phosphorylation. Two sets of multicopy MD simulations of a reduced-length MspA system each containing either variant of the βCAT peptide reproduced the experimentally measured difference in the blockade current, Figure 5c. In such simulations, the peptide’s location was controlled by restraining the coordinates of the maleimide linker above the nanopore constriction, allowing the peptide to adopt its preferred conformation within the nanopore.
First, we noticed that placing a negatively charge phosphate group on a serine residue produced pronounced stretching of the peptide in the nanopore constriction, in comparison to the conformation of the nonphosphorylated peptide anchored at the same location above the nanopore, Figure 5d. The stretching effect was consistent among all replica simulations and robust regarding the choice of the phosphorylated residue, i.e., at position 4 or 8 of the peptide, Figure 5e. The stretching was seen to increase the conductive volume of the nanopore constriction, Figure 5c, and thereby the ionic current via the steric exclusion mechanism. Stretching alone, however, was not sufficient to explain the sustained level of higher current seen for the phosphorylated peptide (top trace in Figure 5c), as the additional steric footprint of the phosphorylated group compensated the conductive volume increase due to stretching when the group entered the nanopore constriction. Further analysis of our MD trajectories showed that the local addition of the electrical charge by the phosphorylation markably increases the local concentration of cations within the nanopore, Figure 5f,g. Tripling the number of the charge carries within the bottleneck to the ion passage, i.e., the nanopore constriction, locally increases its conductivity and, hence, the overall ionic current. Thus, both effects�local stretching of the peptide and local enhancement of ion concentration�contribute to the ionic current enhancement in the specific scenario depicted in Figure 5. We note, however, that the two effects do not have to occur simultaneously, as peptide stretching can be produced by external factors, such as a peptide unfoldase pulling the peptide strand through a
nanopore,38 whereas ion current enhancement can occur independently of stretching when a charged amino acid flanked by uncharged residues passes through the nanopore constriction.

OUTLOOK
We have described four factors affecting the blockade current produced by peptide transport through nanopores. Our description is, of course, not complete and we expect further work to discover additional mechanisms, which could be related, for example, to interactions between the amino acids within a polypeptide strand (akin to base-stacking in DNA) or partial dehydration of the nanopore volume. While we expect the all-atom MD method to continue provide invaluable insights into the microscopic mechanisms enabling amino acid identification, using this method to predict the blockade
current for 109 possible permutations of amino acid residues will remain impractical for the forceable future. Simpler
computational methods43−45 or empirical models,38 informed by the outcome of brute force all-atom simulations, will have to be developed to provide fast and accurate estimate of the blockades current and used for training of the amino acid caller algorithms. Among the most anticipated advances in the methodology of computational modeling of the blockade currents are algorithms enabling computationally efficient and statistically sound sampling of polypeptide conformations under nonequilibrium conditions of the nanopore measurement and precise continuum models of ionic current capable of handling highly nonuniform distributions of ions within the nanopore volume. The advent of such methods will allow the decomposition of the ionic current prediction problem into two independent computational tasks and will create conditions enabling purely in silico machine learning of the sequence−current relationships.

■ METHODS
General MD Methods
Unless specified otherwise, all MD simulations were carried out using
NAMD246 under periodic boundary conditions and a time step of 2
fs. The CHARMM36 force field47,48 was used to describe proteins,
DNA, lipid bilayer membrabes,49 water,50 and ions51 along with the CUFIX corrections applied to improve description of charge−charge
interactions.52−54 RATTLE55 and SETTLE56 algorithms were applied to covalent bonds that involved hydrogen atoms in protein and water
molecules, respectively. The particle mesh Ewald (PME)57 algorithm was adopted to evaluate the long-range electrostatic interaction over a 1 Å-spaced grid. Van der Waals interactions were evaluated using a smooth 10−12 Å cutoff. Bonded and short-ranged nonbonded interactions were evaluated every time step whereas long-range nonbonded interactions were evaluated every third time step. The
Nose-Hoover Langevin piston pressure control58 was used to maintain the pressure of the system at 1 atm by adjusting the
system’s dimension. Langevin thermostat59 was applied to all heavy
atoms of the lipid membrane with a damping coefficient of 1 ps−1 to maintain the temperature of the system at 295 K. The simulations
performed using the D. E. Shaw Research supercomputer Anton260 employed a set of parameters equivalent to those listed above, except
for the use of the Nosé-Hoover thermostat61 and the k-space
Gaussian split Ewald method62 for calculations of the electrostatic interactions.
All-Atom Models and Simulations of poly(dT)12 and poly(D)18 MspA Systems
All MspA systems were built using a reduced-length model of MspA
that included residues 75−120 of the full-length protein.30 Each system contained approximately 40000 atoms and included a 6.5 ×
6.5 nm2 patch of a palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) bilayer solvated with 0.4 M KCl electrolyte. The simulations
employed the M2-NNN variant of MspA,63 where 32 aspartate residues were replaced by asparagine or arginine residues. The poly(dT)14 strand was oriented to have its 3′ end in the MspA vestibule. The poly(D)18 peptide was oriented to have its C-terminus in the MspA vestibule. After 2000 steps of energy minimization and 45 ns equilibration in the constant pressure (NPT) ensemble, each system was simulated for 2 μs in the constant volume (NVT) ensemble on Anton 2 under a 180 mV electrical bias applied across
the membrane.32 The C1′ atom of the 3′ terminus of the DNA and the Cα atom of the C-terminal residue of the peptide were restrained to the same anchor position using a harmonic potential of 1 kcal
mol−1 Å−2 spring constant.
Multicopy Simulations of Charged Peptides Containing Single Amino Acid Substitutions
Initial systems each containing a polypeptides of one of the following amino acid sequences: C(D)22 or C(E)22, were built by combining the peptides with a reduced-length MspA, a DPhPC bilayer and 0.4 M KCl solution. In the main text, we refer to these polypeptides as poly(D)22 and poly(E)22 for brevity. Upon energy minimization and NPT equilibration, each system was simulated in the NVT ensemble under a 200 mV bias while the top residues of the peptide strand were moved by 6 Å up and down multiple times in a 400 ns simulation
using the steered MD (SMD) protocol.64 A representative ensemble of peptide conformations was used to initiate ionic current simulations under 200 mV, which were performed having the top residue of each peptide stationary restrained to its coordinate in the chosen instantaneous configuration. During these 200 ns simulations, the amino acid substitutions were located within 15 Å from the nanopore constriction. The details of the simulation protocols were
described previously.34
MD Simulations of Phosphorylated Peptides in MspA
Each system contained a reduced-length MspA model, a peptide of the specified sequence, two chemical linkers covalently attached to the peptide’s termini, a DPhPC bilayer and 0.4 M KCl solution. The systems were built using previous well-equilibrated peptide con
formations and were re-equilibrated for 20 ns in the constant ratio NPT ensemble. The topologies and parameters of the DBCO-azide and maleimide linkers were generated using CHARMM General
Force Field (CGenFF).65,66 The charges of the atoms at the linker− peptide junction were adjusted by small amounts to produce an electrically neutral linker−peptide−linker conjugate. The conjugate was placed in a pre-equilibrated MspA system. Water molecules overlapping with the conjugate were removed. For each peptide variant, six systems were built differing by the location of the top (maleimide) linker. In all simulations, the phosphorus atom of that linker was harmonically restrained to an anchor located along the z axis 19 to 39 Å above the constriction. The z coordinate of the phosphorus atom of the bottom (DBCO-azide) linker was restrained as well but the atom was allowed to move within the x−y plane using a zero-velocity SMD protocol. The use of such restraints prevented the linkers from developing strong interactions with the nanopore, accounting for the action of the DNA fragments absent in our allatom model. The simulations utilized a hydrogen mass repartitioning
scheme, making it possible to use a time step of 4 fs.67 Each 100 ns production simulation under a 180 mV bias was performed in the NVT ensemble with the system’s dimensions set to the average values observed within the last 5 ns of the corresponding NPT equilibration. Ion Current

where zj(t + Δt) − zi(t) is the displacement of ion j along the z axis during the time interval Δt = 20 ps and qj is the charge of ion j. To minimize the effect of thermal noise, the current was calculated within lz = 20 Å slab centered at the nanopore constriction; the slab spanned the entire simulation system in the x−y plane. Conductive Volume
To calculate the fraction of the nanopore volume available to conduct ionic current, we first compute the average number of bulk-like water molecules confined within the 8 Å constriction of the MspA nanopore from an open-pore MD trajectory. Following that, we compute the conductive volume of the same nanopore section for MD trajectories of the MspA−DNA or MspA−peptide systems. The ratio of the two bulk water numbers defines the relative conductive volume of the nanopore constriction. In all conductive volume calculations, we define bulk-like water molecules as those located more than 2.5 Å away from any protein or DNA atom. Previously, we found this definition of the conductive volume to provide the best correlation with the blockade current produced by a DNA strand in MspA
nanopore.29
