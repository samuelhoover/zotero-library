In nanopore analytics, individual molecules pass through a single nanopore giving rise to detectable temporary blockades in ionic pore current. Reflecting its simplicity, nanopore analytics has gained popularity and can be conducted with natural protein as well as man-made polymeric and inorganic pores. The spectrum of detectable analytes ranges from nucleic acids, peptides, proteins, and biomolecular complexes to organic polymers and small molecules. Apart from being an analytical tool, nanopores have developed into a general platform technology to investigate the biophysics, physicochemistry, and chemistry of individual molecules (critical review, 310 references).
1. Introduction
The sensing of individual molecules has become an important research component within modern biochemistry, biophysics, and chemistry.1 Detecting individual molecules can also lead to the development of next-generation bioanalytical and diagnostic tools.2,3 Among the group of single-molecule techniques, sensing with nanopores is likely the youngest member. Despite its recent inception, the field of nanopore research has increased exponentially within the past 10 years and has become widely accepted.4 One of the reasons for the popularity is the simplicity of the approach. In nanopore sensing, individual molecules pass through a nanoscale pore
leading to detectable changes in ionic pore current. The approach is label-free and does not require the analytes to be immobilised on a surface. Nanopore analytics has also become popular as it has the potential to sequence DNA strands at high speed and low cost.2 While this aim has so far not been achieved, the range of analytes that can be detected with nanopores now spans small molecules, organic polymers, peptides, proteins, enzymes, and biomolecular complexes. Indeed, nanopore recording has developed from a simple sensing tool into a general platform technology which enables the examination of the physicochemistry, biophysics, and chemistry of individual molecules. The proliferation in scientific use has been accompanied by an increase in the variety of nanopores. While initial experiments were solely performed with natural protein pores, man-made nanopores in organic polymers or inorganic materials such as silicon nitride, silicon dioxide, silicon, or silicate are now used on a routine basis. The general use of engineered biological and solid-state

nanopores in biophysics and chemistry has made nanopore analytics a highly interdisciplinary field. This article gives a comprehensive overview on nanopore analytics. Previous reviews have focused on DNA sequencing and DNA detection,2,5–11 non-nucleic acid analytes,12 engineered protein pores,13–16 and solid-state nanopores.6,12,16–18 A review covering pores and sensing has been published 9 years ago.19 Here we attempt to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive account which pays tribute to the highly interdisciplinary nature of nanopore research. After introducing the origin and basics of nanopore analytics, the review will cover biological protein pores and solid-state nanopores. We will describe how the pores are generated and engineered to enhance their functionality, thereby highlighting the similarities and differences between the pores. Furthermore, we will show how pores are applied to sense DNA and RNA as well as non-nucleic acid analytes. The review closes with an outlook on how the field of nanopore analytics might develop.
2. Origin and basics of nanopore analytics
The origins of electrical nanopore recordings6,8,19 can be traced to the conceptual convergence of two preceding techniques: Coulter-counting which was patented 1953,20 and single-channel current recording, which was pioneered in the 1970s.21,22 In Coulter counting, microscale objects pass through an aperture and cause a detectable short modulation in the ionic current flowing through the aperture.20 As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1A, a typical Coulter-counter is composed of two electrolyte-filled chambers which are connected via a microscale aperture. Two immersed electrodes and a potentiostat are used to set up a transmembrane potential which drives a
unitary ionic current through the opening (Fig. 1B), equivalent to a constant resistance at a set potential. When microparticles or eukaryotic cells are added to one chamber, their passage through the aperture can block the pore (Fig. 1C) and cause short pulses of altered resistance. The frequency of these modulations can be used to infer the number of particles, while the magnitude of the modulations is proportional to the size of the objects.19,23 The relationship between molecular size and blockade magnitude is important because it holds that individual molecules can be detected when the pore diameter is of similar nanoscale dimensions. In this respect, nanopore analytics represents Coulter-counting at the nanoscale. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the experimental set-up for nanopore recording is similar to the system used for the Coulter-counting, except for the replacement of the microscale aperture with a nanoscale pore. Given the conceptual similarity in the read-out technology using temporary changes in the resistance, both Coultercounting and sensing with nanopores has been termed ‘‘resistive-pulse sensing’’.19 This term is, however, not entirely accurate as analyte detection with nanopores is usually displayed as current changes rather than resistance pulses (Fig. 1C). Extending the Coulter-counter principle to nanopores has been possible by applying the technique of single-channel current recording. Single-channel current recording has originally been developed to characterise individual membrane ion channels embedded in natural lipid bilayer membranes.21,22,24,25 Ion channels are complex biological structures whose narrow lumen is capable of passing specifically small inorganic ions from one to the other side of the membrane.26–28 Most ion channels are also able to control the flow of ions by opening and closing in response to external stimuli such as voltage, Ca2+, or neurotransmitters. The stimulus-dependent gating is mediated via conformational changes in the protein channel. Prior to the advent of nanopore analytics, stimulusresponsive channels have been exploited to sense specific analytes by using current modulations of single channels as read-out. For example, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine was detected based on the reversible current fluctuations caused by triggered conformational changes in the acetylcholine receptor.19,29,30 Nanopore analytics is different to sensing with biological ion channels. Firstly, biological nanopores are usually reconstituted in artificial membranes,28,31 as pioneered with gramicidin peptide pores,21 or are formed in non-biological membranes composed of inorganic matter or organic polymers.32,33 Furthermore, the current modulations in nanopores are directly caused by the analyte molecules via steric or electrostatic effects. By contrast, the blockades of biological channels rely on the indirect mechanism of conformational changes in the channel structure caused by the specific binding of analytes. Most importantly, nanopores are usually ‘‘blank’’ and lack any intrinsic ability to bind molecules with specificity. While analytes can be detected with biological pores which were designed by nature to bind specific molecules,34–37 it is often advantageous to use blank pores. Blank pores can be equipped with artificial binding sites and can therefore be tuned for a broad range of analytes. The engineered pores detect molecules which bind to the artificial recognition site (Fig. 1D). This sensing mode is conceptually

3. Pores
3.1. Protein pores
The bacterial protein pore a-hemolysin is currently the most widely used biological channel in nanopore analytics. The a-hemolysin (aHL) protein pore is a structure formed by self-assembly of seven identical polypeptides from Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 2). The mushroom-shaped heptameric aHL pore consists of a 14-stranded transmembrane b-barrel and a bigger cap region which is positioned outside the membrane.38 The external dimensions of the pore are 10  10 nm, and the inner diameter of the central channel varies between 2.9 nm at the cis entrance, 4.1 nm in the internal cavity, 1.3 nm at the inner constriction, and 2 nm at the trans entrance of the b-barrel (Fig. 2). Several features of aHL help explain its popularity in nanopore analytics. Firstly, aHL has a robust structure and lacks any moving parts. The resulting unitary conductance facilitates the detection of analyte-induced blockades against an unchanging current level. Under certain conditions (e.g. low salt concentration) the current can, however, fluctuate.39 Secondly, aHL does not feature any intrinsic ability to specifically bind analytes. Specificity can, however, be engineered into the aHL pore by exploiting, thirdly, that the channel walls are amenable to rational design using genetic and chemical means.40 A peculiar characteristic of aHL is its sevenfold symmetry. Due to its assembly into heptamers, a single mutation in the subunit is usually multiplied in the pore. This limitation to obtain a pore with a single change can be overcome with a specialised procedure.41–43 A protein pore composed of a single polypeptide chain is the OmpG porin. Porins are pores from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The membrane proteins are usually trimers of 16 or 18-stranded b-barrels44 but OmpG is monomeric.45 This structural feature is attractive compared to multimeric aHL because a single point mutation can be easily achieved within the monomeric pore. The lumen of porins can, however, contain flexible peptide loops which give
rise to undesired gating.46 Another porin is the MspA pore from Mycobacterium smegmatis. It has a short and narrow channel constriction suitable for the sensing of DNA.47 Less frequently used pore structures include the peptide antibiotics gramicidin and alamethicin. Gramicidin channels are composed of two b-helical peptides which dimerise to form an elongated membrane-spanning tube.48 The sequence of the peptides alternates between hydrophobic L- and D-amino acids thereby positioning the hydrophobic residues at the outside of the channel which interacts with the lipid chains. The two helical peptides of gramicidin channels reside in the two membrane leaflets and can dissociate to migrate laterally within the membrane plane.49 Covalent cross-linking of the two helical peptides is possible.50 The a-helical alamethicin peptides belong to another class of antibiotic channels. Alamethicin forms bundles from more than 10 strands which give rise to pores with multiple conductance states in single-channel current traces.51,52 Several other channels of semi-biological or synthetic origin are available but they have, so far, not been applied for nanopore analytics. Examples among the de-novo designed protein and peptide pores13,14 include structures composed of stacks of cyclic peptide with alternating D- and L-amino acids similar to gramicidins.53–55 Within the realm of synthetic chemical structures with non-biological scaffolds,56,57 octi(p-phenylene)-based pores stand out. The rods carry peptide arms that interact, thereby leading the rods to self-assemble into a barrel-like structure.56 Any future application of the synthetic pores in nanopore analytics would likely benefit from the ease with which functional pore properties can be engineered by standard chemical modifications including peptide couplings.58,59
3.2. Engineering of protein pores
One of the main reasons to engineer protein pores has been to introduce artificial binding sites for analytes. Most of the engineering work has been pioneered with aHL40 because its X-ray structure is available, and the pore is able to withstand drastic mutagenic changes and harsh purification conditions.41,42 Three approaches towards creating molecular recognition sites have been developed. They differ with regard to the means by which the binding site is engineered (Fig. 3). The first approach (Fig. 3A) uses amino acid replacement60 or substitution.61 It has been applied to create a patch of histidine residues to which metal ions bind.42 Similarly, a ring of hydrophobic side chains was engineered to recognise the aromatic explosive TNT.62 Alternatively, one of the aHL protein chains was extended via genetic means to generate a specific molecular recognition site for a kinase.61 Secondly (Fig. 3B), nonproteinogenic receptors are covalently attached to the pore via one or more engineered cysteines. This approach has been demonstrated using pores carrying a single DNA oligonucleotide43,63 or a ligand-terminated PEG chain64,65 to capture complementary DNA and antibodies, respectively. Finally (Fig. 3C), binding sites for small analytes such as drugs and organic solvents can be created by non-covalent adapters. Adapters are ring-shaped molecules which lodge inside a pore while simultaneously mediating the binding of

smaller analytes.66 Non-covalent adapters can optionally be tethered to the channel wall67 but their main advantage lies in the ability to transplant a known binding site into a new structural framework. This has been shown for embedding an adapter originally used for aHL into the OmpG porin structure.46 The approach can be extended to synthetic channels.68 Protein engineering is also performed to delete structural components of protein pores which would interfere with single-molecule sensing. For example, the OmpG porin pore contains a moveable peptide loop which causes current fluctuations in the absence of analytes. This undesired property was greatly reduced by trimming the movable peptide loop with the deletion of amino acids and stabilising it via the introduction of a disulfide bond.46 Similarly, engineering was also applied to improve the sensing properties of porin MspA.47 Here, negatively charged residues were removed at the narrow pore constriction to avoid the electrostatic repulsion to negatively charged analyte DNA. Finally, engineering has been successfully applied to alter the interaction of pores with electrolytes. For example, changes in the voltage-dependent pore conductance were achieved by placing engineered cysteines into aHL and modifying them with charged chemical reagents.69 In addition, genetic substitutions to charged amino acids have turned the mostly non-rectifying OmpF porin70 into a nanofluidic diode.71 The ion selectivity of the OmpF porin was changed by adding two glutamates into the constriction zone of the pore. The engineered construct showed preference for calcium ions over sodium, similar to biological L-type Ca2+ channels.72
3.3. Biological nanopores in lipid membranes
Protein pores can be engineered with atomic precision, but the insertion of protein pores into lipid bilayers is usually less controlled. Traditionally, lipid bilayers are formed across 30 to 100 mm-diameter orifices in hydrophobic polymer-based membranes.31 A protein solution is then added to the electrolyte-filled chamber to induce the random insertion of a single pore into a lipid bilayer membrane, after which excess soluble non-inserted pores are flushed out. This method is widely used and sufficient for many applications. However, it does not give precise control over when the channels insert. Recently, a strategy has been developed to directly introduce single protein channels into lipid bilayers.73 The approach is based on a hand-operated hydrogel probe which is coated with a layer of proteins and mechanically engaged with the lipid bilayer. The methodology has been extended to directly transfer membrane proteins from bacteria to planar bilayers for rapid screening by single-channel current recording.74 The instability of lipid bilayers is another important topic for recordings with protein pores. Ideally, the membrane should be stable to permit hours-long recordings or to create durable sensing devices which withstand pressure fluctuations or mechanical vibrations. However, due to their non-covalent nature, lipid bilayers are fragile and often rupture. The tendency to break can be contained by decreasing the size of the lipid bilayer. This has been demonstrated by using a 2 mm orifice in a polymeric membrane,75 or by forming a lipid bilayer across a 100 to 400 nm wide aperture in a glass nanopipette.76 Chemical reagents represent another strategy to help stabilise membranes. For example, polymerisable phospholipids were used to cross-link the lipids after the protein pore had inserted.77 The stability of the bilayer can be enhanced by soft or hard support structures. Supports made of soft hydrogels have been tested with photopolymerisable polymers,78 poly(ethylene glycol),79 and agarose gel.80,81 A potential drawback of hydrogels is the reduced diffusion and convection-based transport of analyte molecules through the support layer. This limitation can be partially mitigated by using soft hydrogels featuring a meshwork of large holes to facilitate diffusion. For solid supports, several different systems have been developed. One comprises the covalent linking of the bilayer to a support made of gold. The process starts by tethering a lipid monolayer to the support via a spacer unit, followed by the formation of the second leaflet of the bilayer via depositing vesicles which fuse into a contiguous layer. While membrane proteins can still insert into these structures,82–84 the usefulness of the supported bilayer for current recordings depends on the size of the electrolyte reservoir between the conducting substrate and the membrane. Solid support structures have also been implemented without chemical linkage. In this case, porous alumina was employed to stabilise pore-suspended lipid bilayers.85 One of the challenges in this system was to form a tight interface between the membrane and alumina in order to obtain a Giga-ohm seal required for current recordings. This might be achieved by using a polymer cushion between the solid support and lipid bilayer.85,86

Irrespective of the support strategy, the long-term stability of bilayers is compromised by the diffusion of lipid molecules out of the membrane into the solvent. Recently, this limitation has been addressed by replenishing lost membrane components using a pool of lipids. The lipid reservoir consisted of an oil–lipid mixture with suspended lipid-coated water droplets.87 When the droplets were joined together, the lipid monolayers surrounding them combined at the interface to form a robust lipid bilayer. Various protein channels and pores were incorporated into the droplet-interface bilayer. By applying a potential difference with electrodes embedded within the droplets the ionic current flowing through the pores was measured.88 Based on their inherent stability, the droplets may be used in future as devices for bilayer recording with greatly reduced electrolyte volume.
3.4. Solid-state nanopores
Biological pores such as aHL have the advantage of a well-controlled geometry and chemical structure that is known at atomic precision. Every reconstituted aHL pore is exactly the same. This assures reproducibility between different pores and experiments performed in different laboratories. aHL and other biological pores can, however, function only if inserted in a lipid bilayer, which can present challenges as described in the previous section. Synthetic nanopores made in robust silicon materials or organic polymers offer an alternative. These synthetic analogues allow for long recordings over a wide range of external parameters such as temperature, pH, and ionic strength. In addition, synthetic nanopores can be more easily integrated into sensing devices. In this section, we present different strategies to prepare single nanopores in silicon-based materials, polymer foils, and glass. We cover small nanoscale pores as well as structures with a diameter of several hundreds of nanometres. The latter pores are suitable for detecting viruses89 and similarly sized objects, and provide an interesting intermediate system between the nano- and macroscale.
3.4.1. Nanopores in silicon materials. The first solid-state nanopore used for sensing single molecules was sculptured into silicon nitride using an ion-beam.94 The nanofabrication technique uses ion beams of keV energies which have two opposing effects on silicon nitride. Firstly, ion sputter erodes and removes the material leading to the opening of a pore in the membrane. Secondly, energy input via the ion beam results in the surface diffusion, viscous flow, and re-deposition of materials, which causes the closing of the pore. Using a focused ion beam, a 50–100 nm wide pore was drilled (Fig. 4A, left panel), and the pore was subsequently narrowed with a diffuse beam (Fig. 4A, right panel). The pore shrinking was monitored in real time with a feed-back mechanism, allowing the process to be stopped when the desired diameter was reached, thereby offering a precision of B1 nm. The physical mechanism underlying the nanostructuring method was studied in great detail,94,95 along with the influence of various noble gases on the pore shrinking process.96 Although the method of ion beam sculpting is primarily applied to generate pores in silicon nitride, it can also be used for other
materials such as silica, Al, Cr, poly(methyl methacrylate) and polyimide.90 The second breakthrough in the nanofabrication of single nanopores was achieved with a silicon dioxide system using an electron-beam as structuring tool.91 In the first method, a nanopore is generated using standard nanolithography followed by the decrease of the diameter using a diffuse electron beam. The initial pores are fabricated in 70  70 mm2 free-standing silicon membranes with a thickness of 340 nm.97 The multistep process for the pore fabrication includes the thermal oxidation of Si to yield thin layers of SiO2 on both sides of the wafer, the generation of squares of up to 500 nm in the top silica layer using standard nanolithography, followed by etching in KOH to yield pyramid-shaped holes. The last processing step is thermal oxidation to form a 40 nm thick SiO2 layer. This fabrication resulted in pores with diameters between 20 and 200 nm. Similar to ion beam sculpting,94 the diameter of the pores could be further reduced

using a diffuse electron beam of intensity B105 to 107 A m2. Pore shrinking was only observed when the initial pore had a diameter of about 50 nm or less.91 Using electron beams in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) gives the unique possibility to image the pore being created in situ during the shrinking process (Fig. 4B). The rates of pore closing could be slowed down to 0.3 nm min1. In the second method of fabricating SiO2 pores, a focused electron beam with a spot size of a few nanometres is used to drill holes in 10 nm-thin free-standing silica layers.91,98 The diameter of these pores can also be tuned by exposure to a diffuse electron beam.91 Direct drilling of pores with diameters as small as 3 nm was demonstrated as well.99,100 Rather than using the elaborate nanolithographic and TEM-based technique, nanopores can be inexpensively prepared in silicon using asymmetric etching in KOH.92 Crystalline silicon etches along lattice planes, and pyramidal indentations can be easily obtained by using a square aperture in the etch mask. Using this procedure, deep indentations in a 105 mm thick wafer were obtained. The wafer was subsequently placed in a conductivity cell to etch the pore under controlled conditions.92 One side of the membrane was brought in contact with KOH while the other side contained a solution of KCl. The transmembrane current was measured during the etching process in order to detect the moment of breakthrough and stop the etching step. The nanofabrication process typically resulted in the preparation of twin pores with a diameter of B20 nm (Fig. 4C).92 While this method is inexpensive it does not allow for a reliable preparation of small, sub-20 nm pores. Representing another approach, Fig. 4D shows a silica nanotube that was prepared by controlled oxidation of silicon nanowires synthesised by SiCl4 chemical vapour deposition. These tubes were also found capable of detecting single molecules of DNA.93
3.4.2. Polymer nanopores prepared by the track-etching technique. Track-etching is the oldest fabrication technique for single non-biological pores. It has been mostly applied to prepare pores in polymer films such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polycarbonate (PC) and polyimide (PI), as well as in mica.101 In this technique, a dielectric film is first irradiated with energetic heavy ions. Subsequently, local damaged zones created during the irradiation –so called latent tracks– are chemically etched to obtain pores with desired nanoscale or microscale dimensions. Tracks are typically generated using ions of Xe, Pb, Au, and U with kinetic energies in the GeV range. This energy allows the heavy ions to penetrate a B100 mm thick polymer material, or simultaneously irradiate up to eight foils of 12 mm thickness. The unique feature of this technique is the direct correlation between the number of heavy ions passing through a foil and the number of pores created during the wet chemical etching. Initially, the technique was used to prepare membranes containing many pores with micrometre-sized diameters. Fabrication of single pores was enabled by technical advances in the irradiation step to limit the number of heavy ions to one per sample.104 In an alternative approach, a single nanopore is isolated out of many in a membrane irradiated
with B104 ions cm2. Therefore, the traces are chemically etched, and membrane areas with just one pore are then isolated. The process of identifying a single pore can be facilitated by using a light microscope for larger pores, or by indirect visualisation using fluorophores for smaller pores.101,105,106 Etching is conducted as the second step in the process of nanopore fabrication. It achieves that the latent tracks are developed into pores. The etching step is important as it determines the size and shape of the pores. The main parameters to tune the pore diameter are the concentration of the etchant, the etching temperature, and the duration of the etching process. In order to obtain nanometre-sized single pores, the etching step is performed in a conductivity cell to simultaneously measure the diameter. The etching to conically shaped single nanopores is of special importance due to their unique transport properties. A conical nanopore not only has a much lower resistance than a cylindrical pore of the same opening diameter,107,108 but also shows nonlinear current–voltage behaviour which can be exploited for ionic devices.107,109,110 Conically shaped pores in PET and PC can be obtained via asymmetric etching by placing a highly concentrated sodium hydroxide solution on one membrane side while protecting the other side from etching by an acidic stopping medium.102,107,109,111–114 The conditions have to be adjusted to the type of polymer, and PI pores were obtained by asymmetric etching in sodium hypochlorite with potassium iodide as a stopping medium.115 Track-etched pores are routinely characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fig. 5A and B show examples of conical nanopores in PET and PI foils, respectively. SEM is usually used to image pores with diameters above 30 nm, while pores with effective diameters as small as 2 nanometres107,115,116 are characterised by ion conductivity measurements.107,114

3.4.3. Glass nanopipettes. The approach to generate glass nanopipettes with diameters of several tens of nanometres uses commercially available pipette pullers.103,117,118 Typically, a glass capillary is heated in the middle with a laser and then mechanically pulled to break it at the narrow neck, thereby forming two open-ended nanopipettes. By tuning the parameters of heating and mechanical pulling it is possible to obtain pipettes with opening diameters as small as B40 nm. Prior to their application as nanopores, glass nanopipettes have been used in the patch-clamp technique for studying single biological channels,27 and in scanning ion conducting microscopy to image nanostructured surfaces.119,120 An alternative method for preparing glass nanopipettes121 uses a Pt wire with a sharp tip as a mould to form the nanopore replica. The electrochemically sharpened tip is sealed completely into a glass capillary. The closed tip is then polished down so that the Pt tip is revealed. Finally, the Pt wire is etched away completely leading to the formation of an open glass nanopipette. Alternatively, the etching is prematurely stopped leading to the formation of a small conically shaped nanopore chamber. The open diameter of a pipette prepared in this way can be as small as 100 nm.
3.4.4. Sub-micrometre pores. While pores with nanoscale diameters are ideally suited for sensing molecules, larger pores with a lumen of above 100 nm are used for larger analytes such as multimeric complexes of proteins. A route towards single mesoscale pores in borosilicate glass coverslips uses a femtosecond-pulsed laser.122,123 Compared to other techniques, this approach does not require masks, etching or high vacuum. In addition, the pores are prepared in glass, which has superior noise properties, and mechanical robustness. The surface of glass can furthermore be tuned by chemically modifying the silanol groups.124,125 Large pores of several hundreds of nanometres have also been prepared in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) using well-established lithographic techniques. The procedure involves the fabrication of the negative master of a pore and two reservoirs, and the casting of a replica composed of PDMS. One master can be used for the preparation of many nanoporous systems.128
3.5. Chemical modification of solid-state nanopores
Chemical modification can enhance and tailor the properties of man-made nanopores for sensing. Similar to protein pores, inorganic and polymeric materials are modified to (i) remove undesired properties. For example, solid-state pores exhibit enhanced low frequency conductance fluctuations129–131 which affect the quality of the recordings. This problem can be mitigated e.g. by chemical modification of the channel walls using chemical vapour deposition.132 An additional aim for pore modification is to (ii) emulate the ion selectivity of some biological channels by mimicking their natural design principles. For example, the calcium selectivity of biological channels is due to the high density of negatively charged glutamates at the selectivity filter.72,133,134 The residues are key to the functional design as reducing their number via genetic means dramatically changes the selectivity from calcium to sodium ions. A similar electrostatic basis is observed
for the selectivity of other channels.135,136 Engineering ion selectivity into artificial solid-states pores by introducing negative or positive charges in the channel can therefore lead to ion-selective nanofluidic devices. Finally, (iii) modification has the potential to equip artificial pores with the ability to recognise specific analytes. Following nature’s example on the binding of acetylcholine to the acetylcholine receptor, it is conceivable to graft modular binding sites into solid-state pores in order to make them respond specifically to analytes. In this section we describe methods for chemical modification of pores in silicon, polymer, and glass. We provide examples on how surface modification affects the transport of ions.
3.5.1. Chemical modification of silicon-based nanopores. The surface of silicon nitride nanopores can be tuned by the deposition of atomic layers. For example, a layer of aluminium oxide was grown via chemical vapour deposition.132 The B3 nm thick Al2O3 film improved the transport properties of the pores by reducing the 1/f noise level. The alumina layer also changed the surface charge characteristics of the nanopores. In contrast to the cation-selective native pores, the coated pores were not ion selective. This property facilitates the detection of single DNA molecules. Individual SiN nanopores are amenable to chemical modification with organic compounds. Reaction with organosilanes rendered the pores positively or negatively charged, depending on the type of reagent.137 Given that organosilanes can form molecular aggregates, two steps were taken to prevent the blocking of the sub-10 nm pores. The modifying agent was dissolved in an anhydrous organic electrolyte to limit the extent of aggregates. Furthermore, the chemical modification of the pores was performed in a conductivity cell using an applied potential difference to drive unreacted silanes out of the pore. Silicon nitride pores were locally modified by depositing silicon oxide as a rim around the pore entrance (Fig. 6A).126,138 This important approach attempts to achieve a spatially controlled engineering of the pore wall similar to what has been demonstrated with the aHL pore. A membrane with a single silicon nitride pore was placed in a chamber containing a gaseous mixture of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and water vapour. An ion126 or electron beam138 was focused on the nanopore leading to the localised decomposition of the precursor gas and the condensation of silicon and oxide. The resulting silicon oxide layer at the rim of the pore (Fig. 6A) was further modified via silane chemistry to attach single stranded DNA molecules. Each modification step was characterised using current–voltage curves.126
3.5.2. Chemical modification of polymer nanopores. Two major approaches can be pursued to chemically modify polymer pores prepared by the track-etching technique. Both methods utilise the carboxyl groups that are created on the polymeric walls in the course of the chemical etching step. The first way to change the surface chemistry involves the derivatisation of the COOH groups via amide bonds using the coupling reagent 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC).139 For example, attaching diamines to PET127 or polyimide140 pores changed the surface

charge from negative to positive, while coupling of 2-aminoethanol led to neutralisation of the surface charge. This chemical modification has a profound effect on the ionic transport properties of the pores. Before modification, conical nanopores with deprotonated carboxyl groups are cation selective and therefore rectify the current with the preferential flow of cations from the narrow to the big pore opening (Fig. 6B).110,141 After the modification with amines, the pores are positively charged which results in a change to anion selectivity and an inversion of the rectification behaviour (Fig. 6B). The rectification is certainly a consequence of the electrostatics at the channel wall, because neutralising the surface groups e.g. by changing the solution pH leads to linear current–voltage curves. The ion current rectification can be explained by assuming a broken symmetry of the electrochemical potential inside a conical nanopore.110,142,143 This interpretation is supported by qualitative and quantitative modelling using the Poisson–Nernst–Planck equation.144–147 Indeed, the ionic transport properties of conical nanopores can be compared to the functioning of the Schottky diode of semiconductor physics.148 The conical shape of nanopores provides the unique possibility to obtain discontinuous patterns of surface charge. A pattern with radial zones of positive and negative charges (Fig. 6C) was generated in anticipation of the defined ionic diode properties.127 To achieve targeted chemical modification
at the narrow opening of the nanopore (Fig. 6C), a simple yet powerful technique was developed. In the protocol, only the membrane side with the narrow pore opening is brought into contact with a modification reagent, such as EDC and diamine, while the other side is treated with a non-reactive electrolyte solution. Due to the conical pore shape, as predicted from the steady-state solution of the diffusion equation, the concentration of the reagent is very high at the first tens of nanometres at the narrow tip but decays hyperbolically along the pore axis. Consequently, modification occurs only at the region close to the small opening where the reagent’s concentration is sufficiently high. This results in a discontinuous pattern of positive amines at the tip and negative deprotonated carboxyl groups in the remainder of the pore (Fig. 6C, top left). The pore’s current–voltage curve is characteristic as ions only flow in one direction (Fig. 6C, red curve). This ionic diode-like behaviour can be easily distinguished from homogeneously charged pores (Fig. 6B). A similar surface charge pattern has been obtained in a nanofluidic channel149 using a very quickly occurring reaction between biotin and avidin. Another approach towards surface modification of polymer nanopores involves electroless plating of gold, followed by chemisorption of thiol derivatives onto the gold surface.150–154 In the procedure for gold plating, the carboxyl groups on the polymer surface are first complexed with tin. Immersing the membrane in a silver nitrate solution leads to tin-mediated reduction of silver on the pore walls. Finally, the membrane is incubated in a dilute Au commercial gold plating solution in the presence of a reducing agent such as formaldehyde. The gold film grows linearly with time, thereby providing an experimental handle to control the film thickness. The reduction is typically carried out at B4 1C. The slower kinetics result in a homogeneous deposition of gold and avoid clogging of the pore.155 The successful deposition of gold can be followed by recording current–voltage curves. The chemisorption of thiol derivatives was also confirmed using pore recordings. For example, current–voltage curves easily discriminated chemisorbed carboxyl groups from amino groups.156 The chemisorption also enables the attachment of various biomolecules such as biotin. Biofunctionalisation of gold-plated surfaces was demonstrated first using membranes containing many pores,157,158 and more recently for single pores.159
3.5.3. Chemical modification of glass nanopipettes. Surface modification of glass nanopipettes can help tune the ionic properties. Glass nanopipettes are negatively charged, which results in rectification similar to the behaviour of conically shaped nanopores.117 Modifying the walls of B50 nm pipettes with polylysine reversed the surface charge from negative to positive. This change was observed as an inversion of the current–voltage curves.103
4. Sensing and examining individual molecules
Nanopore analytics has been made popular with the protein pore aHL but the sensing of individual molecules with singlechannel current recordings predates aHL. For example, ion

channel blockers were detected via the blockades in current measurements of the acetylcholine receptor channel.160 Furthermore, alamethicin pores detected the PEG polymer chains due to an increased noise in the current level.51 While these experiments were pioneering, they do not represent nanopore analytics in the strict sense because the observed blockades could not be linked to individual molecules. Discrete current blockades caused by individual molecules were first published using the aHL pore.161 The protein pore has a constant current level at a transmembrane potential of 120 mV with a positive sign at the trans side (Fig. 7A and B). When single stranded DNA or RNA homopolymers were added to the cis side of the pore, reversible current deflections from the open channel were observed (Fig. 7A). The almost complete current blockades (Fig. 7A, bottom) represent the voltage-driven translocation of the negatively charged nucleic acid strands through the pore from the cis to the positively charged trans side of the membrane (Fig. 7B). The blockadesalso called ‘‘events’’—reflect the passage of individual rather than multiple strands because the 1.2 nm-wide inner constriction of aHL can accommodate only one individual single stranded DNA molecule at a time. In line with their proposed molecular origin, the frequency with which these events occurred was found to increase with the concentration of the nucleic acids. By comparison, the conductance amplitude of the events and their duration—also called dwell time or event lifetime—was dependent on the length of the strand and the type of homopolymer.161,162 The conductance amplitude is the difference between the open and blocked current levels and can also be normalised to the unblocked current (Fig. 7A, bottom). The event frequency, event lifetime, event amplitude, and the event area163 are four key read-out variables with which molecules are characterised in nanopore analytics.
aHL was also used to pioneer the sensing of individual molecules using an engineered molecular recognition site. In this case,42 the b-barrel of an aHL pore was equipped with several engineered histidines to detect individual bivalent metal cations (Fig. 8A). The cationic metals bound reversibly to the electron-rich imidazole groups thereby causing temporary current blockades (Fig. 8B). Importantly, different cations gave rise to different current blockade signatures (Fig. 8C).164 Blockade signatures represent another property that is used to characterise molecules with nanopore analytics. The frequency of occurrence of the metal blockade events and their duration were Poisson-distributed.42,164 This distribution indicates that the exact time point and duration of the binding events cannot be predicted. The degree of randomness in nanopore analytics has inspired the term ‘‘stochastic sensing’’.15 In stochastic sensing with nanopores, the frequency of occurrence of individual blockade events reveals the concentration of an analyte, whereas the mean duration and amplitude of the events indicate the analyte’s identity.15 The term stochastic sensing was introduced to describe analyte detection with engineered protein pores15,40 but is now also used for sensing with non-engineered nanopores.62,84,165,166 These two pioneering papers42,161 on DNA and metal detection jump-started the field of nanopore analytics to grow to currently encompass analytes such as small molecules, peptides, organic polymers, proteins, enzymes, and biomolecular complexes (Table 1). In addition, the two papers epitomise two

different approaches to the sensing of analytes. The two modes are based on (i) the passage of molecules through a non-engineered pore or (ii) the binding of analytes to an engineered molecular recognition site within the pore. In the following, we will organise the wealth of studies on nanopore analytics (Table 1) according to the use of non-engineered (sections 4.1 to 4.3) and engineered pores (sections 4.4. and 4.5). We wish, however, to point out that this categorisation does not imply that blank nanopores are only used in the Coulter mode, or that sensing via molecular recognition sites always requires an engineered pore. Indeed, we will see that the distinction between the passage and the binding of an analyte can be fuzzy. The distinction between Coulter-mode and molecular binding mode is therefore not always clear.
4.1. Sensing of DNA and RNA with non-engineered aHL
The first report on the translocation of nucleic acids through aHL161 raised the prospect of sequencing DNA strands with nanopores.248 The report also led researchers to investigate the physics of DNA translocation through narrow pores, which is a biologically relevant process.249,250 In this section, we first discuss the physicochemical aspects of DNA passage through the protein pore aHL. Secondly, we present strategies which derive sequence information at the single-molecule level. The chapter will be concluded by showing how nanopore recordings with DNA can help study biomolecular complexes.
Translocation of single stranded nucleic acid strands: pore threading and event frequency. The threading of DNA is the first step in the process of pore translocation. The frequency of threading can be readily calculated from the number of current blockades per time. Several studies have measured the event frequency as a function of transmembrane potential.174–177 In line with expectations, the electrophoretically driven movement of the negatively charged DNA or RNA strand was more frequent with higher positive potentials at the other side of the membrane. The increase in the frequency followed an exponential dependence.174 Below the threshold voltage of 50 mV, no events occurred apparently because the electrophoretic driving force was not high enough to overcome the entropic costs of squeezing a polymer into a narrow pore.174 In an additional study, the voltage range was extended to above 120 mV. At these high voltages the event frequency increased with a lower exponent.175 Most likely, DNA molecules become concentrated at the pore entrance and steric hindrance and repulsion limits their threading into the pore. Additional work in combination with Monte Carlo simulations predicted the capture rate at high voltages of up to 500 mV.176 Apart from voltage, DNA translocation has been studied as a function of the diameter of the pore entrance,174 and the electrostatics of the pore.177 With regard to the latter variable, augmenting the number of positive charges within the aHL pore increased the frequency of translocation over 10-fold over the wild-type protein.177
Strand translocation: voltage and length dependence of event duration. The duration of the blockades decreases with increasing voltage, in line with the concept of electrophoretically driven transport.161 The translocation was studied for a voltage range between 70 mV and 300 mV. As DNA strands
of different lengths were used, the velocity nDNA of DNA transport was obtained from the ratio of the length of the molecules and the duration time of current blockades.173 The experimental data of nDNA vs. applied voltage V could be fitted using a quadratic function of: nDNA = k1(V  V0)2 + k2 where k1 and k2 were constants, and V0 indicated the threshold voltage for DNA translocation.173 Further studies performed with long ssDNA revealed a more complex voltage-dependent interaction between DNA and the pore walls. The data yielded a voltage-dependent diffusion coefficient for DNA translocating through the protein pore.171 Further studies investigated the translocation as a function of strand length.161 At a very short length of 12 nt or below the translocation speed was no longer constant but increased with the shorter oligomers.173 Interestingly, the cut-off value of 12 nt corresponds to the length of the b-barrel indicating the influence of pore–DNA interactions and the drag force which is acting on the translocating polymer in the confined narrow pore.
Translocation: influence of strand composition and temperature. The influence of the polymer composition was first studied by using homopolymeric polycytidylic, polyadenylic, polyuridylic, and polydeoxycytidylic acid strands of around 130–150 nucleotides in length.162 The translocation events showed characteristic event times and amplitudes. In most cases a combination of the two features unambiguously identified the type of homopolymer.162 The different event durations were interpreted to be influenced by secondary structures. For example, the high translocation speed for poly(A) (22 ms nt1) was seen to originate when the helical and 2.1 nm-wide poly(A) strand unwinds to translocate through the 1.3 nm wide inner constriction of aHL. In comparison, the unstructured poly(C) helix with a speed of 5 ms nt1 is thinner and does not have to unfold for translocation. The different current blockades were interpreted to reflect the different extents by which the bases block the current flowing through the protein pore. Indeed, pyrimidine and purine segments within single RNA strands could be identified based on the characteristic current amplitude.162,168 Additional work on DNA strands showed that discrimination can be achieved among DNA strands of similar length.167 The group of strands included homopolymers poly(dC)100, poly(dA)100, block polymer poly(dA50dC50) and poly(dC50dT50), and mixed polymer poly(dAdC)50. Discrimination was achieved by using the characteristic amplitude and duration, and the additional parameter of temporal dispersion. The same study167 also examined the influence of temperature. The analysis yielded that the translocation duration of the DNA strands scales as approximately T2. The T-dependence was taken to reflect the secondary structure of the nucleic acid strands which has to be molten before the strand can pass the pore.167
Orientation of DNA and DNA–channel interaction. Further studies demonstrated that strand orientation and the interaction of DNA with the channel wall play a role in translocation. High-resolution current recordings of homopolymers169 found slightly different current blockades and durations which were interpreted to stem from the threading at the 50 or 30 orientation. The strand orientation hypothesis169 was corroborated by accentuating the duration difference by measuring the

translocation at low voltages rather than high voltages.170 In the measurement a duplexed structure with a free 50 or 30 overhang was trapped inside the pore. The aHL pore is able to trap duplexes because the inner constriction is only wide enough to permit the passage of single stranded DNA. After locking the duplex at high potential, the voltage was lowered to allow the strand to escape. The measured differences in the escape time were in line with the proposed effect of orientation, and the asymmetric interaction between the DNA and channel wall was supported by simulations,170 and studies on the voltage-dependence.171 A related approach on locking and then releasing DNA has also investigated the anomalously long escape times. These non-exponential kinetics were related to the DNA–pore interactions.172 Long escape times indicative of DNA–pore interactions were also observed using single stranded DNA. Here, a feedback control system was used to rapidly lower the voltage while individual DNA molecules are inside the pore.251
Sequence information on DNA hairpins and trapped duplexed DNA. The ability of aHL to pass single but to lock double stranded DNA is also exploited for DNA biosensing. In the approach, a hairpin enters the pore but cannot pass until the duplex unzips and translocates in single stranded form. Systematic studies using different hairpins have established a strong correlation between the type of hairpin and the current blockade. Based on characteristic current signatures, the nanopores were able to discriminate between stem length, base mismatches, and loop length in the hairpins.180,183 Furthermore, it was possible to detect just an additional unpaired base180 and indeed identify the four combinations of Watson–Crick base pairs at the ends of hairpins.181 This sensing approach has been advanced by using a machine learning algorithm to automatically classify the DNA hairpin molecules according to sequence.182 In a related approach, sequence information is obtained via the formation of perfect matched/mismatched duplexes between analyte and probe strands.63,188 This approach uses a biotinylated DNA with a bound streptavidin cap. The free DNA end of the complex threads into the pore. The DNA is long enough to bind complementary analyte DNA strands on the other side of the membrane. Reversing the potential destabilises the duplex and leads to strand dissociation. As mismatched DNA duplexes have a lower stability,63,181,186 single point-mutation could be detected based on the lower threshold voltage for duplex unzipping.63,188 The approach can be performed using hundreds of aHL pores in a lipid bilayer, thereby facilitating the parallel measurements of hundreds of analyte strands.190 DNA duplexes have also helped to sense an individual base position in a single stranded DNA molecule.178 The single stranded overhang of a duplex was held inside the aHL pore by the wider double stranded duplex. This arrangement placed a single base position next to the narrow inner constriction, which is the bottleneck of current flowing through the aHL pore. Different bases in the static position gave rise to different current blockades.178a Another study showed that the transmembrane b-barrel of an engineered aHL pore contains 3 recognition sites that can be used to identify all 4 DNA bases
in an immobilized single-stranded DNA molecule. The identification was independent whether the bases were located in an otherwise homopolymeric DNA strand or in a heteropolymeric strand.178b Sequence information was also obtained from translocating rather than static DNA strands.179 In the approach, chemical tags were attached to individual bases within a single stranded DNA molecule. Owing to their larger diameter, tag-modified bases slowed at the narrow constriction of the aHL protein pore. The pattern of modified and unmodified bases gave rise to a characteristic current signal for the DNA, and the approach was used to discriminate between single nucleotide polymorphisms.179b
Unzipping for single-molecule force spectroscopy. In biophysics, unzipping with nanopores opens up a window to examine the energies and forces of duplexes at the single-molecule level. For example, a detailed examination of the unzipping kinetics has provided estimates for enthalpy barriers to the biomolecular transition.186 Furthermore, the unzipping kinetics of individual DNA hairpins under constant force or constant loading rate187 have been measured. In combination with a kinetic analysis using Kramers theory of diffusive barrier crossing, these force measurements have yielded kinetic parameters such as intrinsic rates, transition state locations, and free energies of activation.189 The studies on DNA unzipping are relevant because they highlight the suitability of nanopores to conduct single-molecule force spectroscopy187–189 which has previously been performed with optical tweezers252,253 and atomic force microscopy.254,255 Compared to the more established approaches, nanopore force spectroscopy does not require DNA molecules to be immobilised on a bead, solid support, or cantilever. The potential of nanopores to investigate the forces in biomolecular interactions at the single-molecule level has been further extended to nucleic acid–protein complexes. The

studies were conducted with DNA exonuclease,191 DNA polymerase,192,193 and an RNA binding motor protein.194 As illustrated in Fig. 9A, the nucleic acid strand dangling off the exonuclease complex enters the narrow pore. Fast strand translocation is blocked due to the bulky protein lodged on top of the pore. As the transmembrane potential pulls on the negatively charged nucleic acid strand, the protein nucleic acid complex is destabilised until dissociation terminated the current blockade. The longer blockade events caused by the exonuclease DNA complex (Fig. 9D) can be clearly distinguished from the shorter DNA ‘‘only’’ threading events (Fig. 9C). Detailed measurements of blockade duration and amplitude helped determine the binding strength between DNA and exonuclease191 and also revealed the stepwise enzymatic addition of bases by a polymerase.192,193
4.2. Sensing of DNA and RNA with solid-state nanopores that lack a molecular receptor
The first experiment on the detection of single DNA molecules with solid-state nanopores was performed using silicon nitride pores prepared by the ion sculpting technique. In the study, a 5 nm-wide pore was used to follow the translocation of doublestranded DNA molecules with a length of 500 bp.94 Additional studies expanded the examination using silicon nitride pores,163,195–203 and pores made in silicon oxide,196,204–208,256 organic polymers,166,209,210,214 and glass.118,257
Measurements on the influence of DNA concentration and transmembrane voltage. The sensing of DNA via the Coulter-counter approach has been examined as a function of the bulk concentration of DNA,166,203 the length of the molecules,195,196,203,205,206,209 and the applied voltage.166,195,197,198,200–203,205 These experiments were performed mostly with dsDNA and showed similarities and differences to measurements with the aHL pore. For example, the frequency of the current blockades scaled linearly with the DNA bulk concentration,166 similar to results on the protein pore.161 However, the translocation time was found to increase exponentially with the voltage in the model system of silicon nitride pores.203 In comparison, the passage time for aHL was inversely proportional to the external voltage.161 This strong voltage dependence in solid-state pores suggested that the DNA molecules interacted with the pore walls.203
Influence of DNA length. Measurements with solid-state pores were performed to examine how the translocation time t depends on DNA length, L. The time t for DNA in silicon oxide nanopores was found to depend on the molecule length according to the power law: t E La where a = 1.27,205,206 although a linear dependence with a = 1 was reported as well.201 This result was explained by considering that the polymer coil of the DNA strand to be translocated through the pore experiences an hydrodynamic drag. The drag force opposes the electrical driving force, leading to slower translocation speeds of long DNA molecules through a nanopore. Further analysis of the length dependence in silicon nitride pores found that t had a power exponent of 1.40 for shorter DNA strands (150–3500 bp) and a value of 2.28 for longer molecules.203 These observations are in strong contrast
to the experiments performed with aHL in which linear dependence of the translocation time on the DNA length was reported. The difference in the behaviour of the solid-state and protein pores can be explained by considering the pore diameter with respect to the width of the DNA molecule. The narrow aHL constriction causes very strong interactions between the translocating part of the polymer and the pore lumen. Hence, the passing segment of the DNA dictates the translocation speed. In contrast, solid-state nanopores are wider, and the hydrodynamic drag on the whole polymer molecule has to be taken into account, which leads to the power-law scaling of the translocation time with the molecule length.205
Influence of ionic strength on DNA detection. Measurements on the effect of the electrolyte concentration were stimulated by the following experimental observation: lowering the electrolyte concentration from 1.0 to 0.1 M KCl increased rather than decreased the amplitude of the current blockades.204 This result, in agreement with predictions,20 suggested that at low KCl concentrations a DNA molecule at the pore entrance leads to a higher number of available charge carriers. These additional ions were soon identified as the positively charged counter ions surrounding the DNA phosphate backbone.93,204,207 A DNA molecule thus changes the ionic pore conductance in two ways: (i) DNA excludes ions from the pore due to the finite volume of the strand, and (ii) DNA facilitates the entrance of additional cations.207 These factors can be described using the following equation:207
DG 1⁄4 1
Lpore
p
4d2
DNA mK þ mCl
ð ÞnKCle þ m


where dDNA is the diameter of the molecule (2.2 nm for DNA), nKCl is the number density of potassium or chloride ions, ql*,DNA is the effective charge on DNA per unit length, and mK* stands for the effective electrophoretic mobility of potassium ions along the DNA molecule. The value of the product mK*ql*,DNA can be determined by studying the concentration dependence of DG and identifying a crossover for which DG = 0. Based on this analysis as well as experiments performed with silicon dioxide pores, it was found that the KCl concentration of 370  40 mM corresponds to DG = 0. Thus at this concentration, DNA presence in the pore cannot be detected.
Folded DNA in solid-state nanopores. The diameter of solid-state nanopores is typically larger than the aHL pore. As a result, a DNA strand can thread into a solid-state nanopore not only as an elongated molecule (Fig. 10b) but also in a bent state as illustrated in Fig. 10c and d. As bent dsDNA occupies at least twice the volume of an elongated strand, the possible conformations can be distinguished based on the different current blockades (Fig. 10a). The effect was first demonstrated in 2003195 and further expanded by several
groups.201,205,215
In further work, the duration of the blockades enabled to distinguish DNA molecules according to their length. This detection method was evaluated using a single silicon oxide pore and a mixture of strands ranging in size between 6557 and

Discrimination between ssDNA and dsDNA. The majority of experiments with solid-state pores examined the translocation of dsDNA. Pores in silicon nitride can however be shrunk to dimensions that allow distinguishing of dsDNA from ssDNA.163,196 dsDNA has a width of 2.3 nm while ssDNA is around 1.3 nm wide. The two forms of DNA are readily discriminated with the aHL pore of 1.3 nm limiting diameter. Tuning the opening diameter of silicon nitride pores to below 2 nm allowed for successful DNA unzipping.211 Silicon nitride pores with diameters between 1.5 nm and 2.3 nm were also used for studying stretching and unzipping hairpins.199 On a larger scale, size discrimination was observed in polycarbonate conical nanopores, which translocated linear dsDNA molecules but did not transport dsDNA plasmids.166
Slowing down DNA translocation. While solid-state nanopores can detect and size single DNA molecules, they cannot yet read homopolymeric segments in individual strands. One of the obstacles towards achieving this goal is the very fast translocation of DNA strands through a nanopore. A high translocation speed limits the current resolution of individual bases. A recent review compared various translocation velocities in solid-state systems.18 Several attempts were made to decrease the mobility of DNA in a nanopore. One method involves the use of high-viscosity additives such as glycerol to slow down the
diffusion of DNA through the electrolyte.200 Furthermore, lowering the temperature and the applied voltage were pointed out as other options to slow down DNA.203 It was found that using nanopores with a diameter of B2.7 nm, which is comparable to the width of a DNA molecule, increased the translocation time over 10 times compared to a 5 nm pore.203 This huge increase in the translocation time could not be explained by the increase in the frictional drag, which occurs when a molecule has to squeeze through a narrower pore. Rather, a translocation of a molecule could be envisioned as a process with many thermally activated jumps over small energy barriers, which could lead to a dramatic slowing down of the DNA translocation.203 A new method to decrease DNA translocation involves the technique of optical tweezers.208,212 In this system, the position of a DNA strand in a pore is controlled via a DNA-tethered bead and laser tweezers. This approach was initially used to measure electrophoretic forces acting on a DNA molecule threaded in a nanopore.208,256 The concept of repeatedly characterising the same piece of DNA by ‘‘flossing’’ it through the pore was first suggested208,256 and then demonstrated.212 In a complementary approach,202 the same DNA strands were repeatedly recaptured directly after translocation through a silicon nitride pore. The capturing was achieved by a quick reversal of the transmembrane potential direction. Repeated translocation of the same molecules demonstrates a possibility to trap and manipulate single macromolecules in a solution.
4.3. Sensing of peptides, proteins, and polymers with non-engineered protein and solid-state nanopores
Translocation of peptide strands. The sensing of peptide strands with nanopores shows some similarities to the translocation of DNA strands. This was first demonstrated in a study on the passage of cationic a-helical peptides through the aHL protein pore.225 The peptides with a cross-sectional diameter of 1.4 nm were electrophoretically driven from one side to the other of the pore. The passage was, however, slowed down due to the electrostatic and steric interactions at the narrow b-barrel.225 The resulting energetic barrier for the translocation of the positively charged peptide could be lowered by placing negatively charged amino acid residues at the entry and exit of the b-barrel.258 These findings are of relevance to the biologically important process of peptide translocation and contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of how electrostatic interactions alter the underlying kinetics of translocation.
Unfolding and unzipping of proteins and peptides. Peptides and proteins which are larger than the pore lumen must unfold to pass the narrow opening. This has been shown with b-hairpins229 and proteins.228 In the case of proteins, pore translocation was studied as a function of folding state. By using different concentrations of denaturing agent, native protein as well as partly and completely unfolded proteins were obtained. Completely unfolded proteins led to short pore blockades while partially folded conformations were characterised by long blockades. These results are consistent with the idea that the proteins thread with the free terminus into the pore, but that translocation requires complete

unfolding.228 In the case of peptides, partially as well as fully folded b-hairpins could traverse the aHL pore even though at greatly retarded speed.229
Translocation of folded proteins and protein complexes. Solid-state nanopores have been applied to detect native proteins and protein complexes without unfolding. The experiments were conducted using a silicon nitride pore of 55 nm diameter in combination with BSA protein (5  4  4 nm).220 Size distinction between BSA and fibrinogen (34  4  3 nm) was achieved with smaller nanopores with diameter B10 nm.221 The larger fibrinogen caused bigger current blockades than the smaller BSA protein. In another study, size-dependent current blockades were exploited to distinguish between BSA and the larger immuno-complex with anti-BSA antibody.218,219 Detecting analytes via the formation of larger immune-complexes is advantageous because the large aggregates produce an analyte-specific signal. The latter benefit was demonstrated using glass pores of 650 nm diameter and the enterotoxin B analytes.125 Only specific large immunocomplexes gave rise to blockades while smaller ubiquitous proteins in the sample did not cause current modulations.
Sensing of PEG. The organic polymer PEG was historically one of the first non-biological molecules detected with nanopores.51 In the recordings conducted with aHL, PEG chains were found to cause increased current noise259 and –in additional studies– defined current blockades.232–235,259 The conductance changes were interpreted to represent the molecular permeation of the PEG into the pore. In support of this interpretation, the blockades were dependent on the size of PEG chain.233,259 Furthermore, the residence time of the polymer showed a crossover behaviour, first increasing and then decreasing with the PEG molecular weight.235 The data were explained with a model in which large polymers only partially reside in the pore, and the out-of-the-pore part pulls on the trapped part, thereby acting as an entropic spring.235 In a recent study, aHL was exploited to detect minor variations in the size distribution of PEG.232 The polydispersity arises from differences in the number of ethylene glycol units in the linear polymer chains. In the current recordings, PEG gave rise to discrete current blockades (Fig. 11B) which stem from individual molecules temporarily residing within the pore (Fig. 11A). The different current levels varied slightly in reflection of the minor mass differences between individual PEG chains (Fig. 11B). Indeed, the frequency of occurrence of the blockades accurately represented the relative percentages in the mass distribution found in conventional mass spectra (Fig. 11C).
4.4. Sensing in protein and solid-state nanopores carrying engineered molecular recognition sites
Pores can be equipped with artificial molecular recognition sites to achieve specific binding of analytes. This sensing approach has been inspired by biological channels which carry ligand-specific receptors to control channel opening and closing.260 Unlike these channels, nanopores such as aHL accommodate a great variety of non-proteinogenic sites. This flexibility broadens the sensing spectrum of pores.
Genetically engineered recognition sites. The first report on a rationally designed biosensor element used amino acid patches to bind bivalent metal ions42 and distinguish between various metal analytes.164 Genetic engineering of molecular recognition sites helped create pores which respond to explosive TNT62 or the cellular second messenger IP3.238
Covalently linked recognition sites. Pores carrying covalently attached molecular recognition sites are a versatile approach for sensing analytes. For example, the aHL pore was linked to a tethered DNA oligonucleotide to detect complementary strands (Fig. 12).43 The reversible binding of the free DNA strand led to current blockades with durations of hundreds of milliseconds (Fig. 12). A perfectly matched duplex blocked the pore longer than duplexes with a single point mismatch.63 This observation was exploited to detect a resistance conferring mutation in an HIV-derived DNA sequence.63

The work on DNA-modified protein pores also proved useful to examine the kinetics and thermodynamics of DNA hybridization at the single-molecule level. The kinetic rate constant for duplex dissociation, koff, and association, kon, can be derived from the two characteristic temporal parameters of the binding events, toff, the event dwell times, and ton, the inter-event interval (Fig. 12). koff and kon are related to toff and ton via
koff = 1/toff
kon = 1/c  ton
where c is the concentration of the analyte. The kinetic constants for DNA duplex formation at the single-molecule level were found to be consistent with established literature values for macroscopic duplex formation.43 In addition, the nanopore recordings revealed details of the kinetics difficult to obtain by conventional methods which measure ensemble properties. By investigating the temperature dependence of DNA duplex formation at the single molecule level, the standard enthalpy and entropy of the interaction could be obtained. In general, pores with covalently engineered recognition sites have developed into tools to study the kinetic and/or thermodynamic data on biomolecular interactions. Examples include the binding of pore-tethered ligands to lectins, antibodies, or regulatory enzyme subunits.61,65,165 The approach of introducing analyte selectivity via chemical modification has been extended to solid-state nanopores.261 The channel walls were chemically coated with multiple copies of hair-pin loop DNA. The receptor was able to selectively interact with analyte strands of complementary sequence. The interaction between tethered captured and free analyte DNA was likely specific as a single base mismatch resulted in a significantly reduced number of translocation events. The detailed mechanism of the interactions giving rise to the blockades is, however, not certain and could represent the hopping of analyte DNA from hairpin to hairpin. In addition, it is very probable that more than one analyte molecule was present in the pore at any one time.
Analyte recognition by non-covalent adaptors. Binding sites for other molecules can be created by non-covalent adapters. Adapters are ring-shaped molecules which lodge inside a pore while simultaneously mediating the binding of smaller analytes.66 The concept was pioneered with the adapter b-cyclodextrin (bCD) and the aHL pore. The bCD adaptor was found to temporarily reside in the transmembrane b-barrel. Organic ligands such as 2-adamantanamine, 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, or the drugs promethazine and imipramine reversibly bound to the bCD adapter and yielded analyte-characteristic blockade signatures.66 Reflecting the large number of other host–guest pairs, the sensing repertoire was broadened to include organic solvents.237 The potential of non-covalent adaptors has been impressively demonstrated by sensing individual nucleotide analytes. In the study, the molecular adapter heptakis(6-deoxy-6-amino)-b-cyclodextrin was lodged into the aHL pore (Fig. 13A–C).239a Reversible binding of 20-deoxyribonucleoside 50-monophosphates to the adaptor gave rise to
distinct current levels for each base (Fig. 13D and E). This pioneering work is relevant for DNA sequencing. In the proposed exonuclease approach, a DNA strand is sequentially digested by a pore-tethered processive exonuclease. The released nucleotides are then captured and sensed with the nanopore.2 Additional development is required in order to tether an enzymatically active enzyme to the pore, and to capture each released nucleotide into the pore for sensing with the adapter.2 In a recent study, the adapter molecule was covalently attached to the nanopore and shown to enable the continuous identification of unlabelled nucleoside 50-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8%. Methylated cytosine could also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases. The operating conditions were compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show

that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice.239b
Sensing without reversible current blockades. The detection of analytes with nanopores does not necessarily lead to or require discrete and reversible current blockades. Depending on the nature and the timescale of the analyte pore interaction, other types of current modulation are possible. For example, fast binding and dissociation events can give rise to an increased current noise when the kinetics exceed the temporal resolution of the current amplifier. This has been observed for the interaction of PEG51,259 and metal ions262 with protein pores. On the other extreme of the kinetic spectrum, binding of the analytes can cause a complete current blockade. In one study, a gold pore with a diameter of 4 nm was derivatised with tens of anti-ricin antibodies. Addition of ricin completely abolished the pore current.159 As the ricin toxin has a molecular weight of 60 kDa, it is possible that multiple molecules bound to the antibody-coated pore to completely obstruct the pore lumen. Changes in the current–voltage curve is another read-out for detecting analytes that bind to an engineered nanopore. This approach was demonstrated with conical pores in PET and PI polymer membranes. The polymer pores had opening diameters of B10 nm which is significantly larger than the analyte. The detection of streptavidin, bovine serum albumin and lysozyme was demonstrated. Hydrophobic or electrostatic binding of an analyte to the pore walls led to the reversal of the current–voltage curve.263 Another strategy for detecting analyte relies on the more subtle change of pore rectification. This sensing approach has been illustrated using positively charged drugs and a Kapton pore with negatively charged channel walls.240 The drug was too small to cause detectable transient current modulations, but the electrostatic binding of the drug to the channel wall altered the IV curve of the pore.240 A similar idea was employed in PET pores whose surface characteristics were tuned by direct modification of the carboxyl groups that are present on the pore walls. The electrostatic/hydrophobic interactions of bovine albumin with the pores were studied via recording current–voltage curves with KCl solutions of different pH values.264
4.5. Sensing of covalently attached analytes
Rather than detecting their transient pore passage, individual molecules can also be covalently attached to the channel wall. This approach is suitable to follow chemical or structural changes of a single small organic molecule which fits into the pore lumen. For example, the aHL protein pore was covalently modified with a single photolabile carbamate group (Fig. 14).243 Upon UV light illumination the protecting group fragments, and the pore recordings revealed the intermediates of the decomposition as shown in Fig. 14. The recordings were able to detect the various intermediates because the current depends upon the size, shape, and polarity of the reactants tethered within the pore. As illustrated by this study, examining single-molecule chemistry with label-free nanopore recordings is advantageous because short-lived intermediates
and their kinetics of formation and disappearance can be detected. This would be difficult to attain with ensemble methods or other single-molecule techniques which require labelling. In another study, the light-induced isomerisation of azobenzene was investigated at the single-molecule level.241 Azobenzene carries a phenyl-substituted nitrogen–nitrogen double bond which can undergo a light-induced transition between the cis and trans isomer. When an azobenzene derivative was attached to the pore wall, the two different geometric isomers could be distinguished based on their different current levels. The continuous interconversion between the two isomeric states was observed at the wavelength of 330 nm but not in the dark state. The recordings constitute the first observation of the reversible photoisomerisation of individual azobenzene molecules in an aqueous environment. The approach to follow chemical transitions by nanopore recordings was also applied to other types of chemical transformation such as covalent bond formation.244 Studying chemical modification at the single-molecule level can be extended to other pore systems such as gramicidin.59
4.6. Ionic selectivity of protein and solid-state nanopores
Inspired by ion selective biological channels, attempts were made to prepare nanopores that are selective for simple inorganic ions such as potassium or sodium. The mechanism by which solid-state nanopores can achieve ion selectivity are certainly different to biological channels because the inner diameter of the latter is smaller than 1 nanometre. For example, K+ channels use a narrow passage composed of carbonyl oxygens of the polypeptide backbone.265 A simple way of attaining ionic selectivity in structurally less-defined solid-state nanopores involves the introduction of surface charges to the pore walls. A charge belt can form the basis for electrostatic selection or rejection of ions. For example, a nanopore with positive walls will transport mainly anions, while a nanopore with negative walls will preferentially

Four levels in the single-channel current trace were observed which were ascribed to the carbamate protecting group, the two intermediates, and the deprotected amine, as indicated.

transport cations.136,154,266–270 Historically, this electrostatic selectivity was thought to function only when the radius of the pore is comparable to the thickness of the electrical doublelayer. New theoretical studies show, however, that nanopores with diameters several times larger than the double-layer thickness can exhibit finite ionic selectivity.268 The calculations come from the linear approximation of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and numerical solution of the Poisson–NernstPlanck equations. It is important to note that the selectivity strongly depends on the concentration of the bulk electrolyte, which is in agreement with the dependence of the doublelayer thickness on the bulk electrolyte concentration. As a consequence, at higher concentrations the ionic selectivity is lower. Several experimental approaches have been developed to engineer ion selectivity into pores. On the protein pore aHL, these approaches include the use of a charged non-covalent cyclic molecular adapter. The ring-shaped cyclodextrin was docked into the narrowest part of the pore lumen, which maximised the effect on ion transport.271 The ionic selectivity of the aHL pore was also altered by covalently attaching positive or negative charged reagents to engineered cysteine residues.69 A complementary chemical approach is the tethering of a single PAMAM dendrimer carrying multiple positive charges.272 Experimental approaches to switch ionic selectivity in response to external stimuli are especially attractive. Using polymer membranes, ionic selectivity was regulated by pH273,274 and external voltage.154 In gold-plated pores, applying positive voltage rendered the membrane anion selective. Composite membranes consisting of amine and carboxyl terminated groups exhibited pH dependent surface charge, that determined which ions can be transported through the polymer matrix.273 A system which is responsive to the presence of polyvalent cations such as calcium, magnesium or cobalt(III) was developed with silica nanochannels.275 Due to their intrinsic negative charge, silica nanochannels are usually cation selective. In the presence of low concentrations of multivalent cations however, anion selectivity was observed. Higher cation concentrations inverted the effect and resulted in anionic-selective channels. The inversion of charge selectivity was explained by assuming a two-dimensional liquid layer which changes the effective surface charge from negative to positive.276 Similar effects were recently observed with OmpF biological pores277 and polymer nanopores.278
5. Outlook
The future of nanopore analytics will likely benefit from research advances in three areas: new nanopore materials and chemical modifications, integration of nanopores with non-current based sensing techniques, and synergy with theoretical modelling. Nanopores analytics has so far been conducted with biological, polymeric, inorganic, and metallic pores, but not with individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). SWCNT are expected to be especially useful in nanopore analytics due to the well-defined and tuneable diameter at around 1 nm, along with a wide body of theoretical
modeling.279–282 To date, studies have been conducted on single multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with a diameter of B100 nm.283 Indeed, isolated MWCNT were able to detect charged single particles by the Coulter-counter method.283 Solid-state nanopores prepared so far do not offer the flexibility of performing chemical modification with atomic precision, as has been accomplished with the a-hemolysin pore. We expect that the research efforts in the near future will be focused on developing new targeted ways to perform chemical reactions on the nanopore walls or/and a new way of nanopore assembly.4,17 Single-molecule detection with nanopores has predominantly been carried out using ionic current recordings. Integration of the electrochemical methods with other techniques such as optical tweezers, offers a unique possibility to measure forces between the translocating molecules and the pore as well as to control the electrophoretic mobility of the molecules.212,256 Another approach involves incorporation of fluorescence methods into the electrochemical sensing. For example, fluorescence detection can follow the passage of labelled compounds through nanopores either by detecting the accumulated compounds on one membrane side306 or by tracking individual molecules as they pass through the pore.307 The pore could also act as a guide which unfolds polymeric analyte strands such as DNA as they enter the pore. This could facilitate the step-wise interrogation of the sequence as the strand passes through the pore. For example, it has been suggested that a narrow nanopore can unzip short fluorescence-tagged oligonucleotides from a longer analyte DNA strands to help reveal sequence information.3 Furthermore, DNA sequences could also be read from non-labelled translocating DNA strands (see below). Improvements in the quality of recordings can also advance nanopore analytics. Miniaturization of the devices and integration into nanofluidic systems is expected to improve the ion current recordings. Progress in nanopore analytics will not be possible without deepening the dialogue between experimentalists and theoreticians. Table 2 gives examples of theoretical modelling on the translocation of polymers and molecules through protein and solid-state nanopores. There is already a clear synergy between the experimental and theoretical efforts. Experimental results have stimulated the development of theoretical approaches that are capable to grasp transport properties of the nanoscale systems. On the other hand, nanoporous systems suggested by theory can help experimentalists to achieve specificity and sensitivity in nanopore analytics. As an example we mention a nanopore sensor that may sequence translocating DNA strands. The proposed sensor has built-in electrodes that are set up on opposite sides of the channel wall to monitor the transversal tunnel current. As the tunnelling current would be affected by molecules passing through the pore, it might be possible to detect and analyse local structure of individual molecules such as DNA strands. Theoretical studies have shown that each of the four nucleotides carries a unique signature of tunnelling current, allowing for a fast DNA sequencing.10,295,296 Nanopores containing electrodes for the

transverse current measurements have already been experimentally realised.308–310 In conclusion, nanopore research is a highly interdisciplinary and fast growing area in nanotechnology. It bridges biological pores with robust solid-state nanopores that can be applied in sensing and lab-on-the chip devices. Nanopores form a unique platform suitable for single-molecule sensors and for studying chemical reactions, biomolecular recognition, and electrostatic interactions at the nanoscale.
