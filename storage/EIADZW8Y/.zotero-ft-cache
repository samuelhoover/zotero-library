ABSTRACT: Hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) interactions in metalloprotein active sites can critically regulate enzyme function. Changes in the protein structure triggered by interplay with substrates, products, and partner proteins are often translated to the metallocofactor by way of specific changes in H-bond networks connected to the active site. However, the complexities of metalloprotein architecture and mechanism often preclude our ability to define the precise molecular interactions giving rise to these intricate regulatory pathways. To address this shortcoming, we have developed conformationally switchable artificial metalloproteins (swArMs) in which allosteric Gln-binding triggers protein conformational changes that impact the microenvironment surrounding an installed metallocofactor. Herein, we report a combined structural, spectroscopic, and computational approach to enhance the conformation-dependent changes in H-bond interactions surrounding the metallocofactor site of a swArM. Structure-informed molecular dynamics simulations were employed to predict point mutations that could enhance active site H-bond interactions preferentially in the Gln-bound holo-conformation of the swArM. Testing our predictions via the unique infrared spectral signals associated with the metallocofactor site, we have identified three key residues capable of imparting conformational control over the metallocofactor microenvironment. The resultant swArMs not only model biologically relevant structural regulation but also provide an enhanced Gln-responsive biological probe to be leveraged in future biosensing applications.

INTRODUCTION
Throughout biology, conformational gating mechanisms play key roles in mediating signaling, regulatory, and cascade reactivity by imparting structural control over the powerful
chemistry of enzyme catalysis.1 Oftentimes, these triggered protein conformational changes serve as dynamic regulators of H-bonding networks, profoundly influencing function and reactivity across diverse protein systems. Examples are not limited to metalloenzymes, but such conformational gating mechanisms can be easier to examine in metal-mediated catalytic processes due to the unique spectroscopic features of
different metallocofactor states.2 For example, light activation triggers conformational changes at in the Photosystem II (PSII) acceptor site, specifically modulating H-bonding networks surrounding the plastoquinone molecules QA and QB. This rearrangement of H-bonding networks through the movement of water molecules and amino acid side chains facilitates the formation of active proton transfer (PT)
pathways to QA and QB.3 The formation of these PT pathways is critical, as the electron transfer from QA to QB is coupled to
PT from key His residues to QB.4,5 This dynamic modulation of H-bonding networks through conformational changes
enables PSII to precisely control the sequence of PT events, preventing simultaneous competing pathways and ensuring
efficient, unidirectional flow of protons.6 Similarly, in cytochrome P450cam, binding of the redox partner, putidaredoxin (Pdx), triggers coordinated structural changes in various helices that propagate from the proximal binding site
to the distal site, leading to a closed-to-open transition.7 These changes establish a critical proton relay network in P450cam involving residue D251, which facilitates proton delivery from the protein surface to the oxygen ligand, enabling coupled proton and electron transfer events that culminate in the
formation of the active Fe(IV)�O species.8,9 Extending beyond catalytic systems, the heme nitric oxide/ oxygen binding protein H-NOX, a gas sensor protein found in
bacteria and eukaryotes,10 exemplifies how ligand binding can

induce conformational changes that rewire H-bonding interactions. In the basal state, a proximal pocket H-bonding network maintains the heme in a distorted, high-energy conformation. NO binding and subsequent cleavage of the iron-histidine bond triggers a cascade of structural rearrange
ments.11 These include disruption of the proximal H-bonding network, relaxation of the heme toward planarity, structural changes in the signaling helix, and displacement of the distal subdomain relative to the proximal subdomain. These conformational changes effectively transmit the NO binding signal to the effector domain, showcasing the broader role of
H-bonding network modulation in protein function.12 The foregoing examples underscore the importance of conformational dynamics in fine-tuning H-bonding networks to modulate the local environment and properties of metallocofactors in the protein and reveal the sophisticated mechanism by which proteins achieve precise control over
their function.2 Inspired by these systems, researchers have been designing conformationally switchable artificial proteins for decades, applying them in biosensing, smart biomaterials, cellular engineering, and synthetic biology feedback
cycles.13−15 In a related approach, we have focused on preparing simplified models with which to explore and exploit the roles that conformational gating can play in mediating triggered metallocofactor reactivity. To these ends, we have developed conformationally switchable artificial metallopro
teins (swArMs).16 swArMs are produced by installing synthetically prepared metal complexes within protein hosts that undergo a large-scale and well-defined conformational change upon allosteric effector binding. Previously, we reported a swArM containing a [Co(N3)(dmgH)2] (dmgH = dimethylglyoxime) metallocofactor (abbreviated as [Co(N3)]) bound directly to an installed Cys residue within the E. coli glutamine periplasmic binding protein (GlnBP). We showed that the rate of metallocofactor release from the protein depends on the conformation of the protein, where Gln binding triggers a large-scale protein conformational change
that accelerates metallocofactor release.16 On the basis of the measured pH-rate profile of this process, and the single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) structure of holo-[Co(N3)]-GlnBP, we proposed that the conformational change drives a rearrangement of the H-bond interactions around the metallocofactor and that it is this rearrangement that is responsible for accelerating cofactor release. To enhance these conformation-dependent H-bond interactions between the protein host and the installed metallocofactor, we have undertaken a combined computational and experimental approach toward further protein engineering. We present the single crystal XRD structure of the apo-[Co(N3)]GlnBP swArM and employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to (a) verify the holo-to-apo transition upon loss of Gln, and then (b) examine in silico point mutations to inform the design of [Co(N3)]-GlnBP swArM variants in which enhanced H-bond interactions differentially impact the holo- over the apo-conformer. Finally, we use Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to experimentally test the success of these engineering efforts. On the basis of conformation-dependent changes in the azide (N3
−) stretching frequency within the swArMs, we now report swArM variants in which azide stretching frequency shifts on going from apoto-holo-conformations are four times larger than in our original report. These studies have allowed us to create an improved swArM in which conformation-dependent H-bond interactions
are enhanced. We have used a simple and inert system to model extremely complicated biological reactivity patterns. With an ability to more profoundly influence the metallocofactor binding site upon the addition of Gln, we are now poised to generate novel Gln-responsive ArMs in which the properties of an embedded metallocofactor are modulated as a function of protein conformation.

MATERIALS & METHODS
Materials. All buffers were prepared using 18.2 MΩ-cm resistivity water from a Milli-Q water purification system. All variants of the E. coli glutamine binding protein (GlnBP) were
expressed and purified as previously reported.16 Preparation of Co(dmgH)2(N3)(py), and its bioconjugation to T72C-GlnBP variants to provide a series of [Co(N3)]-Gln BP was performed
according to the previously reported protocol.16 Installation of point mutations was performed by blunt end PCR as described in the Supporting Information (SI). TEV protease was
expressed and purified according to literature protocols.17 Ni-NTA resin was obtained from Cube BioTech and Thermo Fisher Scientific, while Sephadex G25 resin was obtained from Cytiva. Guanidine-HCl and Tris-HCl were purchased from VWR. Dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) were purchased from GoldBio. Isopropylthio-β-D-galactoside (IPTG), 5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and glutamine (Gln) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All chemicals were used as ordered
without further purification. The value of 25.9 mM−1 cm−1 was used as the extinction coefficient of T72C-GlnBP variants in assessing the protein concentration for experimental procedures.
Assessment of Gln-Binding Affinity. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed by the incremental titration method using TA Instruments Affinity ITC. Nano ITC software was used for data collection and raw data was processed in NanoAnalyze. For each measurement, the NanoAnalyze software was used to determine the appropriate concentration of protein and ligand for the experiment. For G119K-, N127R-, N127K-, and N127Y-[Co(N3)]-GlnBP, 70 μM of protein in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 buffer was added to the sample cell and 460 μM Gln in the same buffer was added to the ITC syringe. For Q183K- and Q183Y-[Co(N3)]-GlnBP, 150 μM of protein in 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5 buffer was added to the sample cell and 977 μM Gln in the same buffer was added to the ITC syringe. All samples were degassed before the experiment and a total of 25 injections, each with an injection volume of 2.0 μL were performed. Data collected in duplicate on independently prepared samples provided the average and standard deviation of binding parameters were reported. The data was fit using the independent binding model in NanoAnalyze combined with the blank (constant) model to account for the heat of dilution. Exemplary data are provided in the SI.
Protein Crystallography. Over 600 conditions were screened using a Crystal Gryphon LCP from Art-Robbins Instruments, out of which one condition resulted in a positive hit. This condition was optimized to provide 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 mm crystals of apo-[Co(N3)]-GlnBP after 2 weeks of growth at 18 °C. X-ray quality single crystals were prepared by hangingdrop vapor diffusion from 2 μL droplets of 10 mg/mL protein in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 buffer containing 2.2 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.5 that was equilibrated against a reservoir solution of 100 μL

of 2.2 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.5. The crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution of crystallization buffer containing 20% glycerol for 60 s prior to freezing in liquid N2.
Data Collection, Processing, and Structure Solution. Diffraction data was collected at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team beamline 21-ID-D (Dectris Eiger 9 M detector) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data was collected at a temperature of 100 K and with the beam tuned to a wavelength of 1.127070 Å. The data set was indexed in space group 5 (C121), integrated,
and scaled using XDS18 prior to using the Phenix software
suite.19 A decision was made to cut the data at 3.21 Å resolution based on noted salt and ice diffraction in the images which was likely correlated with a decrease in data quality at higher resolution. The dataset was calculated to contain six protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. This arrangement is accompanied by a solvent content of 49.8%. Using protein chain A of the available glutamine-free GlnBP structure (PDB:
1GGG)20 as a molecular replacement model, Phaser-MR calculated a single solution containing all six monomeric units with a log-likelihood gain (LLG) score of 1048 and a
translation function Z score (TFZ) of 23.2.21 As previously
described,16 a parameter file for [Co(N3)] was derived from an
existing small molecule structure.22 For integration of [Co(N3)] into our protein structure, the electronic Ligand Builder
and Optimization Workbench, eLBOW,23 in Phenix was subsequently employed to generate a coordinate file for the ligand. The geometry restraints for [Co(N3)] were strictly maintained due to the higher than average B-factors and presumably more disordered nature of the ligand atoms relative to those of the protein. A test set comprising five percent of the indexed reflections was flagged in thin shells
prior to refinement. COOT24 was initially used to build and adjust the positions of the amino acids in the structure and to add the [Co(N3)] ligand. Subsequently, COOT was employed to add water and small molecules from the crystallization solution into the model. Simulated annealing composite omit electron density maps along with the PDB validation site were used to evaluate the final structure, which was deposited into
the PDB25 under accession code 8VI8. The resultant structure of apo-[Co(N3)]-GlnBP was robustly investigated using MolProbity to evaluate the modeled geometry of the structure and the chosen side
chain rotamers of the amino acids.26 The crystallized protein retains three residues from the SUMO-tag cleavage at the Nterminus. Due to disorder, the structure lacks two residues at the C-terminus of each of the monomeric subunits. The final structure has 91.33, 8.67, and 0.00% of residues in the favored, allowed, and disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively. Data statistics are summarized in Table S1. All structure figures presented in this manuscript were visualized using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC. The crystallography software packages were
compiled by SBGrid.27
Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. FTIR spectra were obtained in triplicate on a N2-purged Vertex 70 V
spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA) at a resolution of 2 cm−1. The reported spectra were an average of 2000 scans. Samples of 1 mM apo-swArM and Gln-bound holo-swArM in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 were prepared at 75 μm thickness between 2 mm thick calcium fluoride windows. The absorption spectra were generated using the buffer solution as a reference. The
absorption spectra were processed as described in the SI fit to one or a superposition of two Gaussian functions to determine the center frequencies, line widths, and integrated areas of the absorption bands.
General Molecular Dynamics (MD) Methods. All MD
simulations were conducted using the NAMD228 program, under periodic boundary conditions in three dimensions. The CHARMM36 force field was employed to model both bonded
and nonbonded interactions within the protein,29 TIP3P
water,30 and ions.31 A 2 fs time step was utilized for integrating
the equations of motion. The SETTLE algorithm32 was employed to maintain the rigidity of water molecules, while the
RATTLE33 algorithm constrained all other covalent bonds involving H atoms. Long-range electrostatic interactions were
computed using the particle mesh Ewald algorithm34 over a 1 Å-spaced grid. van der Waals and short-range electrostatic forces were computed using an 8−10−12 Å cutoff scheme. Local interactions were assessed at each time step, with full electrostatics calculated every third time step. To maintain a constant pressure and temperature, a Nose−Hoover Langevin
piston35,36 (with period and decay of 100 and 50 fs, respectively) and Langevin thermostat (with a damping
coefficient of 1.0 ps−1) were employed. System coordinates were saved every 4.8 ps. Analysis and postprocessing of
simulation trajectories were carried out using VMD.37 Development of force field parameters for the [Co(N3)] metallocofactor, and descriptions of our analysis of the simulation results are provided in the SI.
All Atom Model of [Co(N3)]-GlnBP. The initial atomic coordinates of the holo- and apo-conformations of the GlnBP containing [Co(N3)] bound to position T72C were obtained
from the Protein Data Bank, PDB ID 8EYZ16 and PDB ID 8VI8, respectively. Missing atoms were added using the psfgen
plugin of VMD.37 PROPKA was employed to estimate the pKa
of titratable residues.38,39 A model of the Gln ligand was constructed by applying both N-(ACE) and C-(CT3) terminal patches to a single Gln amino acid. The systems were then
solvated in an 8 × 8 × 8 nm3 water box and ions were added to make up a 20 mM solution of NaCl. The apo- and holo-systems underwent 5,000 steps of energy minimization, followed by 15 ns of equilibration having all non-H atoms of the protein restrained to their crystal structure coordinates, along with all non-H atoms of the Gln ligand. During this equilibration simulation, the spring constants of the restrains were initially
set to 10 kcal/(mol Å2) and lowered by 3 kcal/(mol Å2) every 5 ns. Subsequently, each system was equilibrated for 20 ns with only the protein backbone atoms restrained with a spring
constant of 10 kcal/(mol Å2). The spring constant was then
lowered to 5 kcal/(mol Å2) for another 5 ns. Each system was then simulated without any restraints for 350 ns.

RESULTS
[Co(N3)]-bound to was prepared by bioconjugating the metallocofactor [Co(N3)] with T72C-bound to. This process involves a ligand exchange reaction wherein the pyridine moiety of the synthetic metallocofactor is displaced by the cysteine residue present in the protein, resulting in the formation of a Co−S bond. The resultant apo-[Co(N3)]bound to was subsequently utilized to prepare screening trays for crystallization. After screening over 600 conditions, 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 mm prismatic single crystals of apo-[Co(N3)]-bound to were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion after storage at 18 °C for 2 weeks. The crystals diffracted to 3.2 Å resolution

and systematic absences with Laue symmetry indicated a space group of 5 (C121). Shown in Figure 1a is the apo-[Co(N3)]bound to structure. This structure closely resembles that of
apo-WT-GlnBP,20 with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between the two structures of 2.0 Å.
In the apo-state, [Co(N3)] interacts with residues D73, E74, R75 and K76 (Figure 1). However, E181, which interacts with [Co(N3)] in the holo-structure, is positioned ∼10 Å away in the apo-structure. In the holo-structure, a H-bond network that includes residues E181, Q183, and T70 connects directly to the metallocofactor. We previously hypothesized that the formation of this network upon cleft closure is responsible for coupling Gln-binding at the distal site to the propagation of conformational changes that impact the proximal [Co(N3)]
environment.16 Now with the crystal structure of the aposwArM in hand, we can confirm that the conformational changes triggered by Gln binding induce marked alterations in the metallocofactor microenvironment, as the H-bond network surrounding [Co(N3)] in the holo-structure is distinctly absent in the apo-structure. In addition to the highlighted residues changing positions, their interactions with other residues also change as a result of their precise movements, leading to significant alterations in the overall environment surrounding the metallocofactor between the apo- and holo-states.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations Recapitulate Holoto-Apo Conformational Change. To understand how the [Co(N3)] metallocofactor interacts with the Gln effector and with the surrounding protein in solution, we performed allatom MD simulations on both apo- and holo- conformations. The model used to develop force field parameters for the [Co(N3)] metallocofactor is shown in Figure S1a. Our simulation setup included a [Co(N3)]-Gln BP swArM solvated in a 20 mM solution of NaCl (Figure S2a). The stability of the structures was quantified by computing the RMSD of non-H atoms comprising the β-sheets and α-helices of the structure over the course of the 330 ns free equilibration simulation. The RMSD of the protein’s secondary structures in both simulations remained, on average, at ∼2.5 Å (Figure S2b). These results indicate that our MD simulations are robust as they recapitulate the established stability in the protein’s
secondary structure.40 Notably, a comparable RMSD of 2 Å was previously reported for the Cα atoms of the WT-Gln BP
protein backbone in both apo- and holo-conformations.41 These similarities suggest that the incorporation of [Co(N3)] into the Gln BP does not affect the stability of the protein. We next set out to test our model by examining the holo-toapo swArM transition upon removal of the bound Gln effector from the holo-structure. To enhance sampling and improve statistical significance, we conducted four equivalent replica simulations, each featuring slight variations in the initial conformation of the protein. The starting conformation of these replicas was derived by extracting the protein’s conformation from the preceding 330 ns equilibrium simulation of the holo-structure at intervals of 75 ns. Figure 2a shows the snapshots of the first replica and compares the conformation to the crystal structure of the Gln BP swArM in the apo-conformation (Figure 1 and PDB 8VI8). Upon removing the Gln ligand from the holo-structure, we found that the [Co(N3)]-Gln BP swArM transitions to the apoconformation within less than 50 ns (Figure 2a). The WT-Gln BP consists of a large domain (residues 1 to 84 and 186 to 226) and a small domain (residues 90 to 180) connected by a
hinge.20 The conformational changes between the apo- and holo-crystal structures of wild-type (WT) maltose binding protein can be characterized as a 35° rotation and an 8° twist of the small domain around the middle of the first connecting
strand at E111.42 In our comparative analysis, we observed a rotation of 38 ± 1° along with a twist of 9.7 ± 0.4°, indicating that the Gln BP swArM follows a similar path to other periplasmic binding proteins. To quantitatively characterize the holo-to-apo transition, we measured RMSD of the GlnBP swArM backbone with respect to the apo-structure. Our analysis shows that the holo-structure initially has an RMSD of 4 Å with respect to the apo-structure, but very rapidly converges to an RMSD of ∼1.5 Å. Interestingly, in replica three, there is an initial jump in the RMSD, suggesting a divergence from the apo-conformation. However, after approximately 25 ns, the structure returns to the trajectory expected for transition into the apo-conformation. This behavior suggests that the transition is robust and stable, demonstrating resilience in the structural changes (Figure 2b). To gain deeper insights into the kinetics of the holo-to-apo transition, we plotted the fraction of native
contacts, represented by the Q-value,43 against simulation time for the four MD trajectories (Figure 2c). The Q-values range from 0 to 1, where Q = 1 signifies a native, folded state, and Q = 0 indicates a state bearing no resemblance to the

native state. In practice, observing a Q-value exactly equal to 1 is highly unlikely in the MD simulation of proteins. Thus, structures with Q > 0.9 are considered native. The plots of the Q-value demonstrate that the holo-to-apo transition reaches an average value of 0.85, which is comparable to the value obtained in the earlier simulation of the apo-structure (depicted by the gray line in Figure 2c). To conduct a residue-resolution comparison of structures, we computed the protein contact maps that detailed the pairwise interactions among the residues within the protein (Figure 2d). Specifically, we generated the 2D self-interaction contact map for all residues of the GlnBP swArM in the apostructure, as well as for the final conformation of the spontaneous holo-to-apo transition in the four simulations. Figure 2d illustrates the difference in the residue-based 2D maps of self-contacts between these two states. Clearly, for
most residues, the contact map difference is less than 1%; however, the maximum difference is 5%. Figure S3 depicts the residues with more than a 5% difference in the contact maps. We observed that the differences predominantly occur in the loops, in the hinge region, and at the ends of helices/sheets. Thus, we find that the removal of the Gln effector from the holo-structure leads to a protein conformation that is nearly indistinguishable from the experimentally solved XRD structure of the apo-conformation. These results signify the reliability of the MD method in predicting such transitions and examining the molecular interactions responsible for impacting the microenvironment surrounding the [Co(N3)] metallocofactor. To examine the apo-to-holo transition, we conducted an additional simulation starting with the apo-conformation of the protein, placing the Gln ligand in the binding pocket according

MD simulations reproduce the spontaneous transition from holo-to-apo conformations of [Co(N3)]-GlnBP observed experimentally (a), with select snapshots illustrating the course of a simulation upon removal of bound Gln (red sticks) from the holo-structure, shown as green cartoon with [Co(N3)] as purple sticks. These simulations are overlaid with the XRD structure of the apo-[Co(N3)]-GlnBP (PDB 8VI8, gray cartoon with [Co(N3)] in orange sticks) for comparison.

to the holo-conformation coordinates. To prevent the ligand from leaving the binding pocket, we constrained its center of mass to the same coordinate as in the crystal structure of the holo-state and also constrained the large domain of the protein. After a 0.5 μs equilibrium simulation, we did not observe any transition from apo-to-holo. This suggests that the apo-to-holo transition is more stochastic and requires longer simulations. Additionally, there might be alternative or intermediate states that the protein needs to undergo to reach the holo-state.
Toward Enhancing Conformation-Dependent Hbond Interactions. Our simulations revealed that, in line
with previous studies,16 the conjugation of the [Co(N3)] complex with GlnBP has no discernible destabilizing effects on the structural integrity of the protein. A comparison of RMSD per residue of the two structures, PDB 1GGG (WT apoGlnBP) and PDB 8EYZ (holo-[Co(N3)]-GlnBP), indicates that most of the secondary structure is preserved upon the introduction of the metallocofactor (Figure S4). However, there are regions where the RMSD per residue is approximately 10 Å, indicating significant structural perturbations. These changes are analogous to those observed between 1GGG (Gln-free WT GlnBP) and 1WDN (Gln-bound WT GlnBP). To quantitatively characterize the interaction between the [Co(N3)] complex and the Gln BP, we analyzed the Hbond interactions between these two groups by conducting a series of MD simulations. Figure 3a specifies the protein residues engaged in H-bond interactions with [Co(N3)], as characterized according to the persistence of these interactions over the simulation trajectory. All H-bonds were calculated with a distance cutoff of 3.0 Å and an angle cutoff of 30°,
criteria widely adopted in MD simulations.44 We also conducted additional analyses varying the distance and angle criteria, using distance cutoffs of 2.8 and 3.2 Å and angle cutoffs of 20° and 40° (Figure S5). While the exact number of H-bonds varied with different cutoffs, the overall pattern of Hbond interactions remained consistent. After confirming that different cutoff values maintained the same relative order of persistence, we compared the H-bond interactions between the [Co(N3)] complex and the protein in the apo- and holo-states (Figure 3a). We found that in the holo-structure, H-bonds mostly form between C72 (the backbone residue to which the metal complex is affixed) and the nearby residues. However, in the apo-structure, the H-bond network shifts from C72 to the metal complex and nearby residues. These findings are consistent with our experimental observations using a related organometallic [Co(CH3)]-GlnBP swArM, where we had observed the accelerated release of cofactor upon addition of
Gln to apo-[Co(CH3)]-GlnBP.16 Such an accelerated release could be caused by protonation of the lower axial C72 ligand to
the metallocofactor.45 If true, we would expect such an acceleration to vanish at elevated pH, precisely as experimentally observed. We note however that, on average, the total number of H-bonds within metal complex and Gln BP remains below one (Figure S2c), and that the H-bond persistence is below 10% for all native residues (Figure 3a). To enhance conformation-dependent changes in the Hbond network, we introduced point mutations computationally and ran simulations for ∼330 ns each. These variants were then prepared experimentally to test our predictions. Although only a single 330 ns replicate was conducted for each variant, our RMSD analysis of heavy atoms in the secondary structure indicated that this duration was sufficient for most variants (Figure S6). Given the large number of mutations, which
necessitate substantial computational resources, and considering that the simulations in this study were designed to guide mutagenesis for subsequent experimental validation, we opted
to limit each simulation to ∼330 ns.46 We started with three candidates for subsequent experimental mutagenesis: Q183, N127, and G119. The Q183 residue was deemed to have particular significance as this residue is engaged in the interactions with the metal complex in both the apo- and holo-states (Figure 3a). Residue G119 was chosen because of its proximity to the metal complex and the feasibility of its steric constraints to accommodate an additional side chain. In the apo-conformation, residue N127 exhibited no discernible interactions with the metallocofactor; however, in the holoconformation, it demonstrated small yet statistically significant H-bonding interactions with the metallocofactor. From five mutation simulations running for 330 ns each on Q183 (Q183 to H, S, K, T, and Y - Figures S7 and S8), we found that mutating Q183, which initially interacted with the metal complex with an occupancy of less than 1%, to Y resulted in a substantial increase in the H-bond occupancy, reaching up to 10.4 ± 0.9%. Similarly, the Q183K mutation was observed to elevate the Hbond occupancy to 5.6 ± 0.2%, as shown in Figure 3b. We conducted six point-mutations on G119 (G119 to R, H, E, I, Y, and K; Figures S9 and S10), running each system for 330 ns. Through these studies, we discovered that mutating G119 to a positively charged residue (K or R) led to a significant enhancement in the H-bond network, with G119R and G119K mutations exhibiting notable improvements in H-bond occupancy, from 1% up to 49 ± 1% and 26 ± 3%, respectively. In our investigation of residue N127, we conducted six mutation simulations (N127 to R, D, E, H, K, and Y - Figures S11 and S12) and found that substituting the residue with Y, K, or R resulted in enhanced H-bond persistence between the residue and the metallocofactor in the holo-conformation, with the increase ranging from 3% to 10%. This phenomenon was attributed to the partial negative charge on the azide (N3
−)
axial ligand of the metal complex.
Experimental Investigation of Computation-Guided Variants. Informed by our computational predictions, we set out to prepare the swArM variants predicted to significantly modify the differences between apo- and holo-H-bond networks surrounding the metallocofactor. Here, our motivation was to evaluate and enhance the propagation of protein conformational changes toward affecting the properties of the metallocofactor itself. Accordingly, we introduced mutations at positions G119, N127 and Q183 and generated GlnBP variants: Q183K-T72C, Q183Y-T72C, N127Y-T72C, N127K-T72C, N127RT72C and G119K-T72C. Unfortunately, the variant predicted to have the largest change in H-bond interactions containing a G119R mutation failed to express and thus could not be examined. However, all of the other variants were successfully expressed and purified, with yields ranging from 100−120 mg/ L. The synthetically prepared cobaloxime cofactor Co(dmgH)2(N3)(py), where py = pyridine, was site-specifically attached to position T72C in each variant, where a ligand exchange reaction takes place in which loss of py likely precedes coordination of the Cys thiolate ligand to the Co(III)
center.47 Any excess cofactor is removed by passing through Sephadex G25 resin. Successful bioconjugation was verified by the characteristic UV−vis absorbance feature of the Co−S
charge transfer band centered at 325 nm (Figure S13).45 Additionally, mass spectra showed the corresponding peak for each variant attached to [Co(dmgH)2] fragment, (N3

during electrospray ionization), as shown in the SI (Figures S14 − S16). ESI-MS also supports that very little protein was unmodified with [Co(N3)]. The metallocofactor [Co(N3)] absorbs at 280 nm, thus the concentration of each bioconjugate was determined by a BCA assay for subsequent experiments. To determine the impact of mutations on GlnBP function, the affinities of apo-[Co(N3)]-Gln BP variants for Gln were quantified by ITC (Figures S17−S22). The Kd for Gln dissociation from [Co(N3)]-T72C-Gln BP was previously determined to be 0.73 ± 0.05 μM, where WT-GlnBP, has a
Kd = 0.24 ± 0.01 μM.16 Most of the variants examined experimentally, exhibited similar Gln affinities to the parent swArM, ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 μM (with ±0.03−0.05 μM, respectively) as reported in Table S2. However, one variant stands out; Q183K-[Co(N3)]-GlnBP exhibits a Kd for Gln dissociation of 15 ± 2 μM, representing a ∼ 20-fold decrease in affinity (Table S2). The reduction in Gln affinity for this variant relative to the parent swArM indicates that the engineered mutation not only alters the metallocofactor site but also perturbs the Gln binding affinity to some extent, in other words, these results indicate that the two sites are coupled by way of a shared protein microenvironment. After validating the Gln-binding abilities of our swArMs, we set out to assess whether we had successfully enhanced the conformation-dependent H-bond interactions therein. FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the N3
− ligand stretching frequencies within the protein, which provide an indication of the protein-induced perturbations to the complex relative to its state in dilute solution (Figures S23 − S28). The results of these studies are provided in Table 1. Each spectrum was collected in triplicate on independently prepared samples, and
subsequently fit to either one or two Gaussian functions as detailed in the SI. The holo-states were generated by saturating the [Co(N3)]-GlnBP variants with excess Gln to induce complete binding based on the measured Kds reported in Table S2. In the parent T72C-[Co(N3)]-swArM, a small shift of ∼1
cm−1 was observed upon binding Gln, despite the fact that marked changes in metallocofactor reactivity were triggered by
Gln binding.16 This result is in-line with the fact that generally, metal-N3 complexes are not highly sensitive to environmental
changes.48 As such, we were unsurprised to observe only small shifts in the N3
− stretching frequencies for most of the variants assessed, where for N127K, the apo-to-holo shift was smaller than the shift relative to the WT stretching frequency (Table 1). However, the Q183K variant exhibited a substantial, 3.8
cm−1 shift to lower frequency upon Gln-binding. Moreover,
the related Q183Y variant exhibited a shift of nearly 10 cm−1, albeit in only one of two holo-conformers comprising ∼27% of the total population (Table 1). For all variants, the azide stretching peak downshifts upon conformational change from the apo- to the holo-state, suggesting that the metallocofactor is now situated within a more hydrophobic environment. We anticipated that the variants bearing the charged side chains of K and R residues would demonstrate the most pronounced alterations in azide stretching frequency, however, this prediction held true solely for the Q183K variant. Unexpectedly, among all the N127 variants, it was the N127Y variant that exhibited the most substantial change in azide stretching
frequency, shifting by 1.9 cm−1. Overall, the FTIR data provided evidence that altering the H-bond network through computation-guided predictions represents an excellent strategy with which to refine and modulate the conformation

dependent microenvironment surrounding a metallocofactor. Changes in the local electric field could also potentially contribute to the observed shifts in azide stretching
frequencies.49 However, our previous findings on the pHdependent kinetics of [Co(CH3)] metallocofactor release suggest that alterations in H-bonding networks surrounding
the metallocofactor likely play a significant role.16 Consequently, we hypothesize that the observed changes in azide stretching frequencies, which were predicted by MD simulations modulating H-bond interactions, primarily result from modulations in H-bond interactions.

DISCUSSION
Metalloprotein design represents a key goal in catalysis and protein engineering. Advances in this field have the potential to reshape industrial approaches to fine chemicals production, biomedical drug delivery and sensing, and biomass conversion
technologies.50 Notwithstanding, this goal is challenged by the fact that to date, consensus regarding how enzymes work
remains to be reached.51 Accordingly, in addition to applied impacts, research in metalloprotein design also has the potential to address this question at a fundamental level. We report here an interdisciplinary approach to this challenge that combines solid-state structural data with computational and spectroscopic studies. Together, our results have provided enhanced differences in conformation-dependent intramolecular H-bond interactions that have been shown to impact metallocofactor reactivity. Our ArMs are unique in that they mimic an aspect of enzymology that is ubiquitous in nature yet rarely incorporated into artificial systems; they exhibit conformational gating (Figure 1). Previously, we showed that effector (Gln) binding in these systems drives a conformational change that triggers accelerated organometallic cofactor
release.16 Using a stable yet spectroscopically active congener of these organometallic cofactors containing an inert azide ligand, we have now been able to computationally predict, and then experimentally test, mutations to enhance H-bond interactions with the cofactor in the holo-swArM state. After successfully obtaining a crystal structure of apo[Co(N3)]-GlnBP, we sought to use MD as a tool in the design of mutations that might enhance conformation-dependent Hbond interactions at the metallocofactor active site. Through these efforts we were able to reproduce the holo-to-apo conformational change observed crystallographically (Figure 2). MD simulations on WT GlnBP have previously led to debate in the literature regarding the accessibility of the closed state in the absence of Gln. A previous study by Wang et al. combining MD simulations with NMR residual dipolar coupling data concluded that apo-GlnBP exists in an equilibrium with two major populations: open (∼47%) and closed (∼40%) forms, which closely mirror the apo-open and
holo-closed crystal structures, respectively.52 The ensemble also contained two distinct minor species, each accounting for less than 10% of the population. However, a subsequent study by Bermejo et al. using the highly sensitive NMR technique of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement spectroscopy refuted the existence of a substantial population of the closed form in the
absence of Gln.53 Building further on these findings, the group went on to review the dynamics at play in a number of periplasmic binding proteins. Their analyses led to a correlation between substrate specificity and dynamicity in these systems, with promiscuity in substrate binding associated
with increased conformational sampling in the apo-state.54
GlnBP is a highly substrate-specific periplasmic binding
protein,55 and thus our results observing minimal conformational sampling in the apo-state are consistent with this correlation. Given that large global conformational changes in proteins typically occur on extended time scales of milliseconds
to seconds,56 our results reveal a remarkably rapid transition from holo-to-apo swArM states within less than 50 ns of removing the Gln ligand. Moreover, our secondary structure analyses do not reveal any interdomain dynamics. Thus, while we cannot rule out the potential existence of alternative open species and minor populations (each comprising less than a few percent), our results support the notion that even in our modified swArMs, the closed state is predominantly only accessible in the presence of Gln. Herein, we focused on three sites for mutations that may enhance H-bond interactions with the installed metallocofactor. One site (G119) was selected through rational design, while the other two (Q183) and (N127) were selected through computational analyses. MD simulations predicted these two sites; they would not be expected by simple inspection of the X-ray crystal structure. The variants of Q183 and the Y variant of N127 gave rise to observable impacts in the spectroscopic signatures of the complex, namely the azide stretching frequencies (Table 1). It is interesting to note that for G119K, MD predicted the largest change in H-bond persistence of approximately 25% between the apo- and holoconformations, however, the shift in azide stretching frequency observed via FTIR spectroscopy was relatively modest (1
cm−1). For Q183, the K variant elicited the largest change in azide stretching frequency even though it was predicted to show a smaller change in H-bond persistence by MD as compared to the Y variant. For N127, the changes in azide stretching frequency corresponded closely with the predicted changes in H-bond persistence as determined by MD analysis, following the trend N127Y > N127R > N127K. Together, all of these findings highlight some consistencies and also some disparities between the outcomes predicted by MD simulations and those observed experimentally, suggesting the intricate nature of H-bond interactions, as well as the need for comprehensive experimental validation to complement computational predictions. Whereas MD simulations provide invaluable insights into the structural dynamics and energetics of proteins, they operate under idealized conditions, neglecting the full complexity of biological systems. Moreover, the accuracy of force fields utilized in MD simulations, despite continuous improvement, may still exhibit limitations in accurately capturing the nuances of H-bonding interactions,
particularly in metalloproteins.57 Similarly, the XRD structures of apo- and holo-swArMs that were critical to our ability to develop a hypothesis regarding the nature and impacts of Hbond interactions therein, represent energetic minima in the solid state, and may not be representative of the structures and interactions operative in solution at room temperature. Ultimately, all three techniques (XRD, MD simulations, and FTIR spectroscopy) were needed for the successful development of an enhanced swArM.

in conjunction with MD simulations, we developed a deeper understanding of the correlations between triggered changes in the molecular structure of the protein host with those of the electronic structure of the installed metallocofactor active sites. These findings guided our rational metalloprotein engineering and design efforts toward therapeutic interventions and biotechnological applications in which Gln-responsive changes in H-bond interactions are being leveraged in the detection of biomarkers. In addition, by interrogating the structural and dynamic properties of metalloproteins through these efforts, we can validate, refine, and expand upon our understanding of complex biological systems.
