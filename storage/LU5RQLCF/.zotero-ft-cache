ABSTRACT: The membraneless organelles (MLOs) play a key role in the cell, yet it is unclear what controls the morphology and dynamics of MLOs in crowded cell medium. Using a biphasic coacervate droplet as a model of MLO, we online monitored the liquid−liquid phase separation process in crowded medium provided by poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or dextran. In PEO solution, which has an affinity with the inner phase, the spherical droplets evolve into clusters, networks, and completely phase inverted spheres in sequence with increasing PEO concentration, while in dextran solution, which has an affinity with the outer phase, the coacervates maintain the morphology but vary in phase ratio. Flowerlike and even Janus structures are formed in the mixed PEO/dextran medium. Our work demonstrates that MLOs could be controlled solely by the crowded cell medium.
M
embraneless organelles (MLOs), which are formed through intracellular coacervation or liquid−liquid
phase separation (LLPS),1 participate in many key cellular
activities.2−5 Some MLOs are proven to be hierarchical in structure, with immiscible subcompartments fulfilling different
biofunctions.6−8 Several biphase or multiphase coacervates9−12 have been developed to unveil the basic principles behind these hierarchical structures. It is shown that the difference in interfacial energy and density of phases governs the formation
and morphology of these coacervates.13,14 The MLOs are formed not in diluted solution, but in extremely crowded cytoplasm with the total macromolecular
concentration up to 400 mg/mL.15,16 It is well established that the macromolecular crowding and confinement from volume exclusion promotes the reactions or processes, resulting in
decreased volume (e.g., protein folding),17−21 and increases
the effective reactant concentration.22,23 Moreover, the nonspecific interactions between the environment and targeted
molecules also alter the molecular conformations.24−27 It has been demonstrated that the crowded environment affects
LLPS28−30 by promoting droplet fusion,31,32 generating denser
coacervates,33 and participating in the condensed phase.28,34,35 The presence of crowder in the solvent or its participation in phase separation inevitably varies the interfacial energy of the
droplet.36 In the case of multiphase coacervate, the change in the interfacial energy could tune the morphology, generating attractive hierarchical structures. To testify this hypothesis, we studied the coacervation of poly(L-lysine) (PLL), quaternized dextran (Q-dextran), and single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssoligo) in crowded media provided by poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or dextran.
PLL/Q-dextran and ss-oligo solutions with equal amount of crowder were prepared separately beforehand. The biphasic coacervates were formed by mixing the two solutions with equal volume. The final concentrations of Q-dextran, PLL, and ss-oligo are 0.9, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively. Without crowder, PLL, Q-dextran, and ss-oligo spontaneously form biphasic coacervate droplets with PLL/ss-oligo being the internal phase and Q-dextran/ss-oligo being the external phase. As the positive charges and negative charges are balanced (± = 1.0), only one spherical phase is formed inside the droplet (Figure 1A,G). In PEO solution at 6.0 mg/mL, the PLL/ssoligo droplets and Q-dextran/ss-oligo droplets connect with each other to form clusters (Figure S1). Eventually, the clusters transform into a giant PLL/ss-oligo core attached by several Qdextran/ss-oligo droplets (Figure 1B). In 35.0 mg/mL PEO solution, the clusters are stable. The strand is composed of continuous PLL/ss-oligo phase with Q-dextran/ss-oligo droplets distributed inside (Figure 1C). The clusters turn into a coacervate network with increasing PEO concentration to 50.0 mg/mL, and the Q-dextran/ss-oligo droplets in the strand align into necklace structures (Figure 1D). In PEO solution at 75.0 mg/mL, spherical biphasic droplets similar to that in Figure 1A but with the phases completely inversed are formed (Figure 1E,H). The droplet size decreases with further

increasing PEO concentration (Figure 1F), which can be
attributed to the macromolecular confinement effect.37 The internal PLL/ss-oligo phase occupies 35% of the droplet volume in the control group (Figure 1I), while it occupies 51% and 47% of the total droplet volume in 75.0 mg/mL PEO and 100.0 mg/mL PEO, respectively. The content ratios demonstrate that the PLL/ss-oligo phase is more compatible with PEO solution. The PLL/Q-dextran/ss-oligo coacervates were formed through growth, fusion, and maturation (Figure S1). Without PEO, the biphasic droplets grow larger via Brownian motion coalescence, in which the exterior Q-dextran/ss-oligo phase fuse with each other, followed by the fusion and relaxation of
interior PLL/ss-oligo phase into spherical shape.38 In PEO solution at 6.0 mg/mL, similar process is observed. However, the PLL/ss-oligo subcompartments inside the droplet cannot fuse into one phase in due course, forming biphasic coacervate droplet with worm-like structure (Figure 2A and Movie S1). In 50.0 mg/mL PEO solution, the fusion of PLL/ss-oligo phases into spherical shape is more severely hindered. Both Qdextran/ss-oligo phase and PLL/ss-oligo phase serve as the connection points, arranging the droplets into a branched and then network structure (Figure 2B and Movie S2). In 75.0 mg/ mL PEO solution, the fusion of PLL/ss-oligo phase becomes the leading process, while the Q-dextran/ss-oligo phase is internalized with time (Figure 2C and Movie S3). Eventually, the cluster evolves into a spherical biphasic droplet after about 2 h (inset in last panel of Figure 2C). Coarse-grained modeling is applied to simulate the phase inversion process induced by PEO. Since the unit for LLPS is
the primary complex at +/− = 1.0,37 and the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged polymers can be casted
into an immiscibility between the polymer and solvent,39 the primary complexes of Q-dextran/ss-oligo and PLL/ss-oligo are treated as neutral polymers A and B, respectively. Only short
range interactions are considered. The hydrophobicity of these polymers follows B > A ≫ PEO. PEO is set to has affinity with B, as shown by its sequestration into PLL/oligo phase (Figure
S3) and as reported in literature.40 Details of simulation are listed in the Supporting Information. Results show that coacervate droplets are formed in all the studied nPEO/nB range, and the system exhibits a dilute phase and two condensed phases of polymers A and B (Figure 3). Without
PEO (nPEO/nB = 0), the B polymers are wrapped by its A counterparts. The phase separation within droplet originates from the hydrophobicity difference of A and B, and the more hydrophobic B polymers take up the inner space to avoid the disadvantageous B−solvent interface, which agrees with the
experimental results.39,40 Hydrophilic PEO can penetrate into the B phase due to their affinity, decreasing the hydrophobicity of phase B and thus making the contacts of solvents with B−C phase more favorable than that with the phase A. At nPEO/nB = 0.17 and 0.33, a small amount of PEO begin to bind with B, reducing the immiscibility between phase B and solvent. Meanwhile, the droplets turn to Janus shape to lower interfacial free energy of the system. At nPEO/nB = 0.67 and 1.00, A phase is barely wrapped by the less hydrophobic B/ PEO mixture. Complete phase inversion occurs at nPEO/nB = 1.33. The radial density profiles of each species (Figure S2) clearly demonstrate that the droplets adopt well-defined core− shell structure at nC/nB = 0 and 1.33, but with A and B phases completely inverted. As a crowder, dextran exhibits an effect different from that of PEO. The droplets maintain their original shape and structure in dextran solutions up to 150.0 mg/mL (Figure 4A−E). Dextran shares the same backbone with Q-dextran and is

compatible with the Q-dextran/ss-oligo phase.38 Therefore, small amount of dextran (<25.0 mg/mL) in the environment facilitates the formation of Q-dextran/ss-oligo phase but hinders the PLL/ss-oligo phase, resulting in a droplet with smaller internal phase (Figure 4F,G). With furthering increasing dextran concentration to 150.0 mg/mL, the neutral dextran participated in the continuous phase weakens the electrostatic interaction between Q-dextran and ss-oligo, leading to a dissolution of the Q-dextran/ss-oligo phase. The internal PLL/ss-oligo phase also shrinks due to the enhanced macromolecular crowding and confinement. Clearly, PEO exhibits more pronounced effect than dextran on regulating the phase separation of PLL, Q-dextran, and ssoligo. It is mainly due to its nonspecific interactions with the internal phase. Interestingly, new morphologies are formed in their mixtures. For example, the coacervates grow into flowerlike structures with Q-dextran/ss-oligo as the main body and PLL/ss-oligo as patches on the surface in 40.0 mg/mL PEO with 80.0 mg/mL dextran (Figure 5A). Such structure is not observed in any polymer solution containing single crowder, indicating that both PEO and dextran regulate the phase separation. To further demonstrate this point, we monitored the phase separation process in solution with the same PEO and dextran concentrations, but dextran was added afterward. The PLL/Q-dextran/ss-oligo droplets form network structures after 1 h in PEO solution (Figure 1D). Right after the addition of dextran, both the PLL/ss-oligo phase and the Q-dextran/ssoligo phase in the network dissolve and shrink (Figure 5B and Movie S4). When only one lump is left in about 15 min, the fusion of the internal Q-dextran/ss-oligo subcompartments occurs, and the droplet turns into a shape different from flower-like structure, suggesting that LLPS in crowded medium is also controlled by kinetics. The evolutional behavior of the droplets initially formed in dextran solution is more drastic as PEO is added afterward.
PLL, Q-dextran, and ss-oligo form regular spherical biphasic droplets in dextran solution in 1 h (Figure 4D). The addition of PEO instantly causes a heavy merge of the particles. A gigantic droplet with mixed phases is formed in less than 10 min (Figure 5C and Movie S5). It eventually evolves into a Janus droplet with the diameter in the order of 0.1 mm, visible to naked eyes (Figure S4). The final concentrations of PEO and dextran are 80.0 and 40.0 mg/mL, respectively. If PEO and dextran are mixed beforehand, flower-like structures with less patches than that in Figure 5A are formed (Figure 5D). Semimerge of droplets caused by PLL/ss-oligo patches also occurs occasionally (Movie. S6). In conclusion, the crowded medium generates profound effect on the LLPS processes. In general, the size of the phase(s) shrinks with increasing crowder concentration due to the macromolecular crowding and confinement effect. More importantly, a variety of morphologies are formed when the crowders have nonspecific interactions with the phase, especially the internal phase. Taken together, the LLPS could be controlled solely by the dynamic crowded environment. Since the crowded cellular interior contains a variety of background molecules, and each may possess certain affinity with the phase or subphases in the MLOs, the structure and functions of MLOs could be regulated by the crowed environment which is sensitive to the external variations.
