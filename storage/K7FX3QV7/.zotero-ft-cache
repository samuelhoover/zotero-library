Interfacial tension in polyelectrolyte systems exhibiting associative liquid–liquid phase separation Vivek M. Prabhu
Abstract
A continued interest in polyelectrolyte phase diagrams guides the study of interfacial phenomena driven by polyelectrolyte complexation. The liquid–liquid interfaces formed by associative phase separation of oppositely charged synthetic and natural polyelectrolytes provide measurement challenges addressed by force-sensitive methods and deformed droplet retraction. The ultralow interfacial tension, typical of these systems, is sensitive to salt concentration and temperature and displays universal features described by mean-field theory. Several areas of fundamental development and novel applications of charge complexation for interfacial study and examples from membraneless organelles and biomolecular condensates are described.

Introduction
The dissociation equilibrium between counterions and polyelectrolytes in a solvent with high dielectric constant, such as water, solubilizes a nominally hydrophobic polymer. Introducing an oppositely charged polymer, instead of small-molecule salt, favors counterion dissociation and the formation of interpolyelectrolyte complexes. These soluble complexes may aggregate or coalesce into dense, highly hydrated coacervate
materials derived from liquideliquid phase separation in combination with chain association. This macromolecular phase separation forms interfaces between the dilute phase and dense polyelectrolyte-rich phase. Such polyelectrolyte coacervates have been the subject of several reviews [1e7]. The selective partitioning of polyelectrolytes is of keen interest in the study of formation of organelles in cells [8e10], in situ formed adhesives [11,12], protein and pharmaceutical separations [13e16], and complexation and delivery of DNA and RNA [17,18]. Formulation modification of the surface and interfacial tension properties of such viscoelastic fluids are essential for printing, spraying, or dispensing applications [19].
The interfacial tension between coexisting charged polymer-containing phases depends on the symmetry of polymer mixing, salt identity, linear polymer charge density, and degree of polymerization. Experimental data with these dependencies on interfacial tension would enable the development of a thermodynamic theory and comparison with simulations. Universal properties of neutral polymer solutions near the critical temperature, including the critical exponents, critical amplitudes and the dependence of interfacial tension, and interfacial width on the degree of polymerization, are already understood [20e23]. Studies on these properties are scarce for polyelectrolyte solutions and are only just beginning with polyelectrolyte mixtures and complex coacervates. There are basic questions about the physics of the intermolecular interactions in these systems and the reduced variables relevant to defining an equation of state; the significance of molecular parameters such as chain length, chain stiffness, and so on; and the role of ion and polymer solvation. The development of an equation of state description would provide a good start in making progress in characterizing these complex fluids. Measurements of critical exponents [24,25] are helpful in identifying the type of critical phenomena exhibited by these systems. The interfacial tension affords an opportunity to address the critical point scaling, and this property is particularly important in relation to applications of these materials.
The interfacial tension (g) between coexisting phases near the critical point follows universal scaling described as

with critical amplitude go and reduced temperature
(ε = jT  Tcj/Tc), where Tc is the critical temperature and m is the exponent. The critical amplitude for neutral polymer solutions follows unique molecular mass (N) scaling [20]. Studying these basic properties of complex coacervates is complicated by the question of whether these systems are in thermodynamic equilibrium or are dominated by kinetics [26].
We highlight recent reports on aqueous associative liquideliquid phase separation and formation of droplet domains. These droplet interfaces serve as opportunities for tensiometry measurements [27] and model systems for designing new formulations and separation science. The interfacial tension between the coexisting phases in polyelectrolyte coacervates is ultralow (1e 100 mN/m) (Table 1). By comparison, the surface tension of water is z70 mN/m, and the interfacial tension between silicone oil and water is z35 mN/m. The magnitude of the interfacial tension may be estimated in terms of the ratio of the thermal energy to the square of the characteristic length scale, which would be the radius of gyration of the polymer [28] or more appropriately the correlation length near the critical point [25]. In addition, the main results from the theory of Helfand and Tagami predict that the interfacial tension between immiscible polymer blends is proportional to the product of average monomer density and square root of the FloryeHuggins interaction parameter that characterizes the van der Waals interaction energy between the polymer and the solvent [29]. Therefore, miscibility of components that also influences the magnitude of the chain dimensions is the factor that leads to low (or high) interfacial tension. A number of techniques are available to measure surface and interfacial tension including the Wilhelmy plate, the Du Nou ̈y ring, maximum bubble pressure, capillary rise, pendant drop, and sessile drop methods [30]. To study ultralow interfacial tensions, methods such as colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM), surface forces apparatus (SFA), spinning drop method, and deformed drop retraction are necessary. Recent measurements of several different synthetic and natural associating liquideliquid polyelectrolyte coacervates provide connections between improvement in polymer fundamentals, measurement methods, and insight for applications.
Associative liquid–liquid phase separation Phase diagrams for mixtures of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and polyelectrolyte solutions are typically shown on a plot of added salt concentration (Cs) versus polyelectrolyte concentration (CP). Qualitative features of the phase boundaries are often characterized by turbidity [31], thermal analysis of each phase [32],
fluorescence [33], and spectroscopy [34]. Analyses of each phase for Cs, polyanion, and polycation concentrations, especially with nonstoichiometric mixtures, are less frequently performed. Turbidity or cloud points in associating mixtures may not always represent the binodal curve as shown recently with polymers in ionic liquids [35], wherein concentration analysis of each
phase was possible by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Recently, a few studies compared the shape of the binodal with a theoretical model [33,36] or simulation [37] building upon the initial efforts of Spruijt et al. [38]. Spruijt et al [38] studied charge stoichiometric mixtures of the weak polyelectrolytes polyacrylic acid (PAA) and poly(dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate) at pH 6.5 and applied the VoorneOverbeek (VO) theory. Salehi and Larson [36] used an extended VO free energy model that includes counterion associationedissociation, cross-chain ion pairing, and charge regulation by treating each as a reversible chemical reaction for comparison with the measurements of Wang and Schlenoff [39]. Their model predictions deviated from the experimental binodal diagram of the strong polyelectrolyte system of poly(styrene sulfonate) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) at low salt concentrations with a constant Florye Huggins c parameter. Lou et al. [33] and Friedowitz et al. [40] similarly include ion binding equilibria between small ions and polyions and interchain ion pairs between polycations and polyanions with an extended VO model. They compared their revised model with a new system of homologous oppositely charged polyelectrolytes based on a poly(acrylamide) main chain. This model could fit the binodal shape with a single c parameter for each increasing polarity through addition of H2O2, as shown in Figure 1a. This advancement most likely was made possible by the homologous polymers versus the poly(styrene sulfonate)/PDADMAC or PAA/ poly(dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate) system that has different local main chain structures that could lead to differing interaction parameters (solvation) within a FloryeHuggins or VO theory. Molecular simulation offers insight into the most challenging aspects of hydration, solvation, and ion specificity beyond continuum theories [41,42].
Validation of models for coacervation is challenging owing to the limited availability of quantitative phase diagrams [4]. Including ionepolymer and polymere polymer binding equilibria [43] in addition to charge correlation effects and chain connectivity is important to advance a thermodynamic theory. Additional contributions from dipolar interactions and effective interaction parameters are proposed [44]. The development of new linear polyelectrolytes with varied charge density by adding hydrophobic comonomers [45] and increasing the hydrophobic side chain length [46] provide

opportunities for model development. A firm foundation for macrophase separation of linear polyelectrolyte mixtures [7] may guide the development of microphase separation based on alternate chain architectures [47].
These synthetic polyelectrolyte systems offer opportunities to understand biological systems that exhibit macromolecular phase separation during formation of organelles. While biological systems cannot be manipulated to the extent of synthetic systems, polymer models provide insight into the phase behavior. For example, Nott et al. [48] observed electrostatically driven organelle formation of spher
ical Ddx4N1 protein droplets, whereby heating cleared the phase-separated solution and increasing Cs lowered the transition temperature in live cells or in vitro. Notably, arginine methylation, which changes the charge density and increases hydrophobicity, dramatically lowers the phase transition temperature by 25 C, which equivalently was achieved by a 100mmol/L increase in Cs. Zhou et al. [49] reviewed systems of protein and ribonucleic acid associative phase separation that are controlled by intrinsically disordered regions in the protein, such that selective deletion of these regions suppresses the formation of organelles. The phase envelopes on the CseCp plane are described by an upper critical salt concentration [50] similar to synthetic polyelectrolyte complex coacervates (Figure 1a). This is illustrative of the process of electrostatic-driven phase separation that leads to droplet phase morphology. Recent theoretical developments have considered the effect of charged sequences as they apply to organelle formation and coacervation [51,52]. However, not all such natural and synthetic systems exhibit clearing by heating or addition of excess salt, and the type of salt also plays a role in solubility [31,53].
A recent study showed lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of a common polyelectrolyte complex coacervate. A one-phase mixture of potassium poly(styrene sulfonate) (KPSS)/poly(diallyldimethylammonium bromide) (PDADMAB) in KBr was heated to observe liquideliquid phase separation [34]. As shown in Figure 1b, the phase envelope appears symmetric and is dependent on salt concentration. An increase in salt concentration affects the critical temperature and offers an alternate approach to study mechanisms of associative phase separation. Subsequently, a theory for coacervation found that the phase behavior could be described by the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant of water and the c parameter [54]. The coexistence of the dilute solution with dense coacervate presents the classical approach to study the equilibrium interfacial tension. Such studies as a function of added salt and temperature require measurement methods sensitive to low interfacial tension values.
Effect of salt concentration on interfacial tension
As shown in Figure 1, the critical region may be approached by changing salt concentration, such that a reduced salt concentration may be defined εs = jCs  Cs,cj/Cs,c in addition to the reduced temperature (ε = jT  Tcj/Tc), where Tc is the critical temperature and Cs,c is the critical salt concentration.
One expects a transition from the mean field (m = 3/2)
to Ising (m = 1.26) universality class in the critical region as fluctuations become important [4]. In the context of CseCp phase diagrams, Qin et al. [55] derived a theoretical expression by applying VO theory and CahneHilliard theory for interfacial tension of symmetrically mixed polyelectrolyte coacervates near the Cs,c at fixed temperature (Tc), with the interfacial tension scaling as follows:
gy
kB Tc a n
 1  Cs
Cs;c
3=2
N 1=4 (2)
where v is the reference volume (typically water), a is the statistical segment length under theta conditions, N is the degree of polymerization, and kB is the Boltzmann constant [55]. This 3/2 scaling index of the reduced salt concentration was also recovered by selfconsistent field theory, Monte Carlo simulations, and field-theoretical simulations [28,56]. These predictions compare well with different polyelectrolyte systems and measurement methods [57e59].
Spruijt et al. [57] studied aqueous solutions of poly(trimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and poly(3sulfopropyl methacrylate) between 0.250 mol/L and 1.250 mol/L KCl by CP-AFM. Experimental conditions confirm the attractive force upon retraction of the colloidal probe was due to the capillary condensation of the dense coacervate phase in equilibrium with the dilute phase. This allowed for systematic measurements of the ensuing interfacial tension quantified by the Laplace pressure difference across the interface, where the interfacial tension acts to minimize the interfacial area:

where r1 and r2 are the radii of curvature of the capillary bridge and F is the force measured using the calibrated CPAFM cantilever. In the sphere-plate geometry, the forcee distance curve provides the interfacial tension, and extrapolating the force to zero separation distance yields  2Rg cos q, where R is the radius of the colloidal probe and q is the contact angle at the three-phase contact line (substrate, coacervate, and supernatant). An average over scanning velocities provides the estimate for equilibrium interfacial tension. They observe a vanishing interfacial tension with increased Cs, with a scaling law consistent

with m = 3/2. The results were explained by mapping salt concentration dependence into an effective c parameter, which recovers the same scaling dependence of Eq. (2).
Priftis et al. [58] studied stoichiometric mixtures by charge of poly(L-lysine hydrochloride) and poly(D,Lglutamic acid) sodium salt polypeptide complexes between 0.100 mol/L and 0.600 mol/L NaCl with the SFA. In this case, the crossed-cylinder geometry is achieved with mica and sensitive force measurement across the capillary bridge. The interfacial tension was determined using forceedistance curves, with sensitivity on the order of nano Newtons to pico Newtons. The interfacial
tension was determined as follows: g 1⁄4 Fpulloff
4pR cos q, where R is the geometric mean radius of curvature of the mica surfaces and Fpull-off was obtained from the maximum measured adhesion on separation of the surfaces. In these studies, the compression and separation speed of the probe surfaces between the capillary bridge were considered when evaluating the interfacial tension [58]. A vanishing interfacial tension between 0.98 mN/m and 0.35 mN/m was observed with 0.05% by mass polymer concentration, pH 7, and degree of polymerization z200. These results would later be interpreted by Qin et al. to show the mean-field scaling [55].
Later, Ali and Prabhu [59] examined the interfacial tension scaling (Figure 2a) for charge stoichiometric mixtures of KPSS/poly(diallyldimethylammonium bromide). The system motivated the observed mean-field scaling efforts studied closer to Cs,c, while also using the available phase diagram data from Wang and Schlenoff
[39] as replotted by Salehi and Larson [36] to guide the measurements. An initial polymer concentration based on 0.15 mol/L for each polymer leads to a volume fraction of fP z 0.037, which is comparable with the critical polymer concentration. The temperature was cycled to form dilute droplets within the coacervate matrix to study interfacial tension by the deformed droplet retraction (DDR) method [60] developed by the tensiometry field. After an applied shear deforms the drop into an ellipsoidal shape, the zero-applied shear shape-retraction kinetics are quantified by an exponential with characteristic shape retraction time, t,

governed by the force balance of interfacial tension and viscous drag. A separate study of the bulk viscosity of the coacervate (hc) and dilute phase (hd) with viscosity ratio,
p = hd/hc, makes this a quantitative study. The interfacial tension was determined by studying many droplets of different initial radius (Ro). The results are shown along with the data by Spruijt et al. [57] and Priftis et al. [58] normalized by each system’s critical salt concentration and critical amplitude (go), as shown in Figure 2b. The three different techniques and three different polyelectrolyte systems show the mean-field scaling close to Cs,c. More data are needed at even smaller εs prepared at the critical composition to reveal a crossover.
A shared experimental issue across these three methods is that the volume of the capillary bridge or probed droplet should remain constant. In DDR, this

assumption may be validated optically through a kinetic study and through the statistics by analyzing numerous droplets. An additional challenge is the in situ measurement of the contact angle with silicon dioxide CP-AFM tip and SFA mica surfaces. In all cases, the ultralow interfacial tension measurements would be challenging by traditional means.
Vis et al. [61] showed through analysis of the meniscus shape that the interfacial tension was lowered by electrostatic effects in the dextran/gelatin system, a neutral polymer/polyelectrolyte. Values of interfacial tension lower than 10 mN/m scaled with the tie line length, which is consistent with a mean-field model [61]. Mussel adhesive protein and hyaluronic acid, a proteine polysaccharide system, observed an increasing interfacial tension that followed a Hofmeister series with 0.250 mol/L NaHCOO, NaCl, and NaNO3, as measured by CP-AFM [62].
A significant improvement in the quality and quantity of the phase diagrams [23] is necessary to evaluate the degree of polymerization dependence of the critical
amplitude (go w N1/4), near the Cs,c with at least one decade in N at constant salt concentration. Far from the critical point, the interfacial tension also depends on N [58], but an explanation and systematic study with fixed salt concentration remains a challenge.
Effect of temperature on the interfacial tension
Close to the critical salt concentration, a variation in temperature should reveal insight into the more familiar temperatureecomposition phase diagram (Figure 1b).
Using DDR, the KPSS/PDADMAB system was studied on approach to Tc.
Figure 3 shows a mean-field plot by linearizing Eq. (1)

tude, go = (260  80) mN/m, for a fixed Cs of 1.6 mol/L with uncertainty () that represents one standard deviation from the linear regression fit. Similar to the Cs
scaling, g lowers upon reducing temperature, consistent with the LCST and ε = jT  Tcj/Tc. One of the advantages with this approach is that the critical point is at the minimum of the LCST (Figure 1b), whereas this need not be the case in the CseCp diagram (Figure 1a). Measurements with sensitivity to low interfacial tension measurements with accurate temperature control that can introduce droplets on demand would be advantageous.
Charge asymmetric mixing and droplet coalescence
Coalescence kinetics are strongly influenced by the coacervate droplet interfacial tension, interface structure, medium viscoelasticity, and excess surface charge. An elegant way to probe such effects is to study polyelectrolytes as a function of mixing ratios [63,64]. Liu et al. used stopped flow light scattering to observe three kinetic behaviors depending on Cs and mixing ratio (z) in the formation of coacervate phases and dispersed polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) with PAA/PDADMAC. Three regimes were observed based on relaxation/reorganization of soluble PEC, aggregation or rearrangement of small soluble PEC into larger structures, and redistribution of excess charge to produce net

neutral coacervate droplets coexisting with PEC [63]. Net neutral coacervate droplets coexisting with soluble PEC under off-stoichiometric mixing ratios provide a method to form droplets and measure the interfacial tension, under different z. This may be a promising
approach to compare with a liquid-state theory of concentration-asymmetric mixtures [65]. The effect of mixing stoichiometry with natural polyelectrolytes of hyaluronic acid and chitosan provides a method to form suspensions, aggregates, and coacervates [66] as well as stretchable hydrogels [67] and scaffolds [68].
Well-defined layer-by-layer assembled polyelectrolyte microcapsules exhibit fusion illustrating the fluidity of polyelectrolyte exchange [69]. An interfacial modification by coacervation was achieved by aqueous two-phase system microcapsules that form microgel particles by polyelectrolytes that partition to different emulsion phases [70]. All aqueous cell-encapsulating compartments can be made using this interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation principle as well on a 100-mm scale [71].
Shape characteristic measurements and examples from membraneless organelles and biomolecular condensates
Dripping-on-substrate rheology allows for a kinetic analysis of the shape characteristics of a pulled droplet [19] developed to study the aireliquid interface with sensitivity to inertiocapillary, viscocapillary, and elastocapillary regimes. These regimes are characterized by a

numbers (Bo) determined by the gravitational force:surface tension ratio, Bo 1⁄4 rgL2=g. Along these lines, Hann et al. [71] showed how the charge stoichiometry affects pendant droplet stability in an aqueous twophase system.
Pendant drop tensiometry provides a sensitive approach to measure the surface and interfacial tension [27]. The method was extended to compound pendant drops formed when a spherical particle is attached to the primary pendant drop. This configuration enables interfacial tensions for Bond numbers as low as zero [72]. The standard pendant drop tensiometry fails if the interfacial tension force is too low to sustain a stable hanging drop, corresponding to Bond numbers, Bo [ 1. In such a case, DDR and the spinning drop method [73] are alternatives.
Many characterization methods require quantities of material or sample environments that are not amenable to cellular and subcellular study in biological systems. Therefore, while analysis methods used in liquideliquid phase separation of polyelectrolytes are applicable to membraneless organelles and biomolecular condensates, the added constraints may require novel measurement adaptations. Jawerth et al. [74] developed an optical trap approach to study the frequency-dependent rheology and surface (interfacial) tension between the salt solution and protein condensate from the major component of P granules of the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode worm. In this method, two colloidal particles, under optical trap control, are adhered to the surface of the protein condensate. The droplet is deformed by displacing one of the colloids that lead to a force balance on the droplet that considers the opposing forces from the optical traps and the viscous drag of the droplet. The force sensitivity of optical traps and condensate radius between 5 mm and 9 mm uses a theoretical analysis of oscillatory deformation and response function to quantify the surface tension. The methods achieve mN/m surface tension resolution with salt concentration dependence that remarkably follows the scaling suggested by Eq. (2) and shown in Table 1 [74].
The droplet shape fundamentals also apply to intracellular objects to characterize interfacial tension and macromolecular phase separation mechanisms as in vivo and in vitro studies using high-spatial-resolution optical and fluorescence imaging approaches [75]. For example, Brangwynne et al. [76] measured the inverse capillary viscosity (h/g) from the characteristic time for membraneless organelle droplet fusion for droplets positioned using a microneedle. These RNAeprotein droplets had interfacial tension in the mN/m scale (Table 1). In many cases, direct measurements of the viscosity may not be easily determined. However, local transport measurements
via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with known sizes of dye-labeled probes could be used to estimate the viscosity via the StokeseEinstein relationship. Finally, Feric et al. [77] characterized the droplet shape of ribonucleoprotein bodies and their subcompartments under in vivo and in vitro conditions. These liquid-like bodies that contain noncoalescing internal droplets also exhibit ultralow interfacial tension (Table 1). Their studies show that liquideliquid phase separation and the further organization into subcompartments enables localization and processing of biomolecules. The ultralow interfacial tensions naturally imply that very little energy is required to deform, yet stable without the need for an encapsulating membrane.
Opportunities in composition profilometry
Simulations predict composition profiles with an interfacial width on the order of 5s to 10s, where s is the
bead diameter of 4.75 A ̊ [56]. Therefore, methods with nanometer resolution and composition sensitivity such as neutron reflectivity may be useful. Model polyelectrolyte brushes with linear chain complexes may provide insight into the development of composition profilometry of coacervate interfaces and take advantage of thin film methods [78,79]. Interface-sensitive methods such as sum-frequency generation have a lot to offer for coacervate fundamentals [80].
Summary
This review summarizes recent measurement advancements with a focus on associative liquide liquid phase separation and the resulting ultralow interfacial tension. Recent observations on the effects of salt, salt type, temperature, and stoichiometry of mixing affect the chain association and phase diagram. While one transparent theory or equation of state may not address all these effects, the universal behavior with a mean field analysis provides a needed start to describe the phase diagrams and interfacial tension critical scaling and amplitudes. The validation of molecular simulation results and extension to molecular descriptions of the charge correlations and solvation characteristics would help guide the appropriate measurements. Measurement development and applications of such fundamentals for delivery of biomolecules, separation of charged macromolecules, stability, and coalescence behavior of nanoscale droplets are more important than ever.
