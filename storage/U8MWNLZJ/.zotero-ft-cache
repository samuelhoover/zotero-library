A conductive polymer thin film having choline phosphate as the side group was prepared. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was employed to evaluate the adsorption of the model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), on the films deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. Cell adsorption on the film was evaluated by a fibroblast NIH3T3.
Controlled bioadhesive properties are required for advanced biomedical applications, such as prosthetic devices,1 neural probes,2 biosensors,3 and antithrombogenic stents.4 In particular, the antifouling properties of an electrode are critical for many bioelectronic devices, because the unintentional attachment of biological materials to the electrode causes unintended electrical changes.5,6 Conductive polymers are attracting attention as electrodes for bioelectronic devices because they have high flexibility, higher workability and higher synthetic tunability than metal electrodes.5,7 The use of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (poly(EDOT)), a conductive polymer, has been successfully demonstrated for electrodes of various bioelectronic devices.8–11 Poly[2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine] (poly(MPC), Fig. 1) with a phosphatidylcholine (PC) side group is one of the most excellent biocompatible and antifouling polymers.12–20 Inspired by poly(MPC), poly(EDOT-PC) (Fig. 1), which is a conductive polymer having phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the side group, has been reported to have biocompatibility and antifouling properties.21–25 In contrast, poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl choline phosphate) (poly(MCP), Fig. 1) has a choline phosphate (CP)
side group, which is the reverse structure of PC. The CP groups can provide specific PC/CP interactions with the PC groups of cells due to dipole–dipole interactions.26–29 However, a conductive polymer having a CP side group has never been reported.30,31 In this study, we synthesized a poly(EDOT) having a CP side group (poly(EDOT-CP)) and investigated its bioadhesive properties. Recently, we reported that hydrolysis of the methyl phosphate ester in poly(MCP) occurs spontaneously in aqueous solutions.32 Then, we designed a novel hydrolysis-resistant poly(MCP) (poly(MCPm), Fig. 1).33 Poly(MCPm) could successfully suppress the hydrolysis of the ester group. From this point of view, a similar molecular design as poly(MCPm) was adopted to that of poly(EDOT-CP) in this study. EDOT-CP was synthesized using a method similar to the one we have reported recently (Fig. 2).32 Briefly, 2-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane 2-oxide (MeEP) was dissolved in 150 mL of dry acetonitrile (AN) in a Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer under argon flow. N,N-Dimethylmethanamine-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT-N(CH3)2) was then added to the Schlenk flask under argon flow and stirred for 1 week at 70 1C. After that, the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the precipitated oily liquid was collected. The crude product was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)

with chloroform as the eluent. EDOT-CP was obtained with a 12% yield. The structure of EDOT-CP was confirmed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) and mass spectrometry (Fig. S1, ESI†). Poly(EDOT-OH) was deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode according to our previous report (Fig. 3).21 Briefly, poly(EDOT-OH) was used as a primer layer to improve the adhesion between ITO and poly(EDOT-CP). Poly(EDOT-OH) was electropolymerized onto the ITO substrates as thin films under electrooxidation from a 0.01 M EDOT-OH aqueous solution containing 0.05 M sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 0.1 M LiClO4 by applying cyclic potential scans. Then, poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) or poly(EDOT-CP) was deposited on the poly(EDOT-OH) layer under electrooxidation from EDOT-CP and EDOT acetonitrile solutions containing 0.05 M dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt (AOT) and 0.1 M LiClO4. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of poly(EDOT-CP) on the ITO electrode. The sulfate signal was assigned to the main chain of poly(EDOT-CP), whereas nitrogen and phosphate signals were assigned to the side group of poly(EDOT-CP). Carbon and oxygen signals indicate both side and main chains of poly(EDOT-CP). The silicon signal was due
to glass. It suggests that poly(EDOT-CP) was deposited on the ITO electrode. The hydrophilicity of the prepared conjugate film was evaluated from the hexadecane contact angle measurement in water. Pure poly(EDOT-CP) could slowly dissolve in water. Therefore, copolymerization of EDOT as an anchor together with EDOT-CP can prevent the detachment of poly(EDOT-CP) films in aqueous solutions. 9 : 1 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) and 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CPco-EDOT) mean poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) with a 90% and a 70% feed ratio of EDOT-CP deposited on the poly(EDOT-OH) layer, respectively. Frequency change before and after the adsorption of BSA in water was measured with a QCM. For 9 : 1 poly(EDOTCP-co-EDOT), the decrease in frequency was observed, which indicates that BSA could adsorb on 9 : 1 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) (Fig. S3(A), ESI†). Besides, after the polymer film was immersed in water overnight, the binding amount of BSA increased. This suggests the dissolution of 9 : 1 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) in water, which leads to the binding of BSA. When the feed ratio of EDOT was increased to 30%, 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) showed little BSA binding (Fig. S3(B), ESI†). Furthermore, negligible change in frequency was observed after the film was immersed in water overnight. This suggests the good stability of 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) in aqueous solution. In 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT), as it is fixed on the substrate by EDOT as the anchoring group, there was no frequency change before and after immersion in water. In the presence of hexadecane in water, a large contact angle indicates a hydrophilic surface. The root-mean-square roughness of 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-PC-co-EDOT) and 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) was 8.2 nm and 5.3 nm in 5  5 mm2, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). High hexadecane contact angles of 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-PC-co-EDOT) (1801) and 7 : 3 poly(EDOTCP-co-EDOT) (1741) compared with that of poly(EDOT-OH) (911) indicated the formation of a hydrophilic polymer film deposited on the ITO electrodes (Table 1 and Fig. S5, ESI†). The CP group has been reported to have different adhesions between proteins and cells.34,35 In this study, protein adhesion was evaluated from QCM by frequency decrease associated with the BSA adhesion, and the cell adhesion was evaluated by the microscopic observation of a fibroblast NIH3T3. Fig. 4 shows an oscillation frequency change (Df) of QCM with BSA adsorption in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at pH 7.4 on poly(EDOT), poly(EDOT-OH), 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) and 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-PC-co-EDOT). For both poly(EDOT) and poly(EDOT-OH), a large decrease in frequency during the adsorption of BSA was observed. A slightly less amount of BSA adsorbed on poly(EDOT-OH) compared with that on poly(EDOT) may be due to the difference in hydrophilicity between poly(EDOT-OH) and poly(EDOT), whereas 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) and 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-PC-co-EDOT) both

showed negligible frequency change. This indicated that both poly(EDOT-CP) and poly(EDOT-PC) have an excellent antifouling effect against BSA. The cell adhesion property was compared between 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) and 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-PC-co-EDOT). In Fig. 5(A) and (B), cell adhesion was observed on the ITO electrode surface.
However, no cell adhesion was seen on 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-PC-coEDOT) (Fig. 5(A)). In contrast, cell adhesion was observed on 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) (Fig. 5(B)). This result indicated that poly(EDOT-CP) and poly(EDOT-PC) showed different adhesion properties to cells. For the application of biosensor and bioelectrode, we usually use the electrochemical impedance as the index of electrical properties.17,21 We compared the electrochemical impedance by conducting the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Based on our results, the impedance of 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-PC-coEDOT) and 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) is similar to that of poly(EDOT). It suggests that 7 : 3 poly(EDOT-CP-co-EDOT) has a sufficient conductivity for biosensor and bioelectrode applications. We prepared a conjugate polymer bearing choline phosphate as a side group. Protein adhesion experiment shows that poly(EDOTCP) and poly(EDOT-PC) have an excellent antifouling effect toward BSA. Although NIH3T3 cells did not seed on poly(EDOT-PC), the cells seeded nicely on poly(EDOT-CP). We believe that these findings will be useful for the development of advanced bioelectronic technologies.
