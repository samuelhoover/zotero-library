SUMMARY:
The theory of collapse of weakly charged polyelectrolyte gels is generalized by taking into account the possibility of counter ion trapping with the formation of ion pairs, which becomes progressivelyimportant as the gel shrinks and the dielectric constant of the gel medium decreases. A phenomenon well known in the theory of ionomers, namely the aggregation of ion pairs due to dipole-dipole interactions with the formation of multiplets, is also taken into account. These multiplets act as additional physical cross-links. It is shown that accounting for the two effects mentioned above generally leads to an increase of the region of stability of the collapsed phase and to an increase of the jump in volume at the transition point. The most important, qualitatively new effect is the possibility of existence of a new supercollapsed state of a polymer gel which is very close to the densely packed dry gel. The reason for the thermodynamic stability of the supercollapsed state is a loop of positive feedback: the decrease of the volume of the gel leads to a decrease of the dielectric constant and hence to progressive formation of ion pairs, thus the concentration of mobile counter ions and the corresponding osmotic pressure decrease, the gel shrinks further etc. It is possible to realize the phase transitions between all three states of a polymer gel: swollen, ordinary collapsed and supercollapsed.
Introduction
A polymer gel sample swollen in a large amount of good solvent usually undergoes a rather abrupt shrinking when the solvent quality becomes poorer (e. g. by changing the temperature or adding poor solvent). This phenomenon is called polymer gel collapse. It was first predicted theoretically by Dusek ’) and observed experimentally by Tanaka’). It was immediately realized that collapse is a consequence of the coilglobule transition of the network chains2f3). Later, it was discovered that the character of the gel collapse depends essentially on the presence of charges in the network chains: for polyelectrolyte networks this is an abrupt, very cooperative first-order phase transition, while for neutral networks the collapse is usually c o n t i n u o u ~ ~T~h~is) .distinction in the behavior is due to the additional exerting osmotic pressure of counter ions in polyelectrolyte gels4,6). This osmotic pressure can be formed only by mobile counter ions. However, in nonpolar media counter ions can be also trapped and form ion pairs7-’). For polar media, e. g. for aqueous solutions, the probability of ion pair formation is negligible. However, most of the experiments on polymer gel collapse which were performed up to now deal with the collapse in mixed organidwater solvents (see e. g. refs. ’v4)). For these cases the question whether the ion pair formation is essential is open and should be explored.

The formation of ion pairs in a polyelectrolyte gel leads to two simultaneous effects both of which are very important for the collapse behavior. First, due to the decrease of the concentration of mobile counter ions inside the gel the corresponding osmotic pressure also decreases, this fact favouring the formation of a collapsed phase. Second, ion pairs attract each other due to the dipole-dipole interactions and form so-called multiplets9.lo) (Fig. 1 ) acting as additional physical cross-links. Multiplet formation is a concept first introduced in the theory of i o n o m e r ~ ~ - 't~he)r,efore the described effect can be called a mixed polyelectrolyte/ionomer behavior. Formation of multiplets will also increase the region of existence of the collapsed phase and the gel density in this phase. Both factors described aboveare very important and should be included in the theory of polymer gel collapse. This is just the aim of the present paper. We will reconsider the theory of polymer gel collapse, taking into account the possibility of formation of ion pairs with subsequent aggregation of these ion pairs in the multiplets.

For this purpose the simplest theory of the polymer gel collapse in a one-component solvent will be developed, i. e., the complications connected with a mixed solvent and its redistribution in the presence of a polymer network 13, j4) will be avoided. Different probabilities of ion pair formation for different polymer network conformations will appear in our theory due to the different polarities of the solvent (assumed to be polar) and of the network chains (assumed to be nonpolar). We will attribute to the pure solvent the large dielectric constant (having in mind water with c0 = 81) and we will assume that a dry polymer gel (without solvent) has a much smaller dielectric constant E , = 1 . For the dielectric constant of a partially swollen gel we will adopt a linear interpolation dependence

where @ is the volume fraction of polymer inside the gel. Of course, Eq. (1) is a rather crude approximation, but this is the natural first step in the problem of accounting for

the possibility of ion pair formation. We will see that the fact that E depends on @ is very important in the theory of polymer gel collapse. In the next section we will formulate the model and write down the expression for the free energy of the systemunder consideration. The results of the analysis of the free energy and the corresponding discussion are contained in the subsequent sections.
Free energy of the gel
Let us consider free swelling of a sample of a weakly charged polymer gel in a large amount of solvent. We will have in mind networks of the type shown in Fig. 1. Let us assume that T is the temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, a is the characteristic size of a monomeric unit, N is the total number of monomeric units in the gel, m is the average number of monomeric units in the chain between two nearest-neighbour branch points (to be called below “the subchain”); v o is the total number of subchains, v o = N/m. We will consider the case of flexible chains of the gel, in this case a is the only characteristic microscopic size, for example, the length of the Kuhn segment of the chains is also of order a ’ 5 ) . We will assume also that the network chains contain N / a groups that can potentially dissociate (i. e., cr is the average number of monomeric units in the chain between two nearest potentially charged groups, cr >> 1 since we consider a weakly charged gel). As a result of a dissociation-association equilibrium some part of these groups is in fact dissociated and these groups carry the charge e, other groups remain in the associated state, i. e. the corresponding counter ions are bound and form ion pairs. Let /3 be the
fraction of the potentially charged groups that are not dissociated. Then -/3 is the
number of ion pairs and -(1 - /3) is the number of charged links in the gel. The
number of counter ions is equal to -(1 - 8) too.

We will consider a salt-free solution. In this case, since the network should be electrically neutral, all the counter ions remain inside the gel sample. At equilibrium the number of ion pairs is determined by two factors: the energy gain
of electrostatic attraction of ions - e*/(ca)(we will assume that the characteristic distance between the ions in an ion pair is of the order of the characteristic size of a monomeric unit), and the entropy loss of translational motion of ions involved in ion
pairs. The corresponding dimensionless parameter which controls the equilibrium is7,8,15)

For polar solvents, such as water, the value of E is large, the value of u is usually less than unity, and practically all the potentially charged groups are dissociated (Bis close to 0). In nonpolar solvents (E of order unity) usually u >> 1 and all the counter ions form ion pairs (B = 1). Because of the attractive nature of the dipole-dipole interaction, ion pairs form multiplets (see Fig. 1) which can act as additional physical crosslinks. So, the number

of subchains in the network changes: each new crosslink leads to the appearance of two new subchains (for simplicity we will assume in the present paper that each multiplet consists of two ion pairs; the accounting for multiple aggregation is trivial and does not lead to any new effects).
Let v be the number of new network subchains, then v + vo is the total number of N
subchains at equilibrium. The maximum value of v is equal to vmaX= -p.

The free energy of the network can be written as a sum of five terms
where F,, is the free energy of elastic deformation of the network; Fini,s the free energy of volume interaction of monomeric links; Fois the free energy connected with entropy of mobile ions; Fd is the free energy connected with ion pair formation; F, is the contribution to the free energy due to the formation of new physical crosslinks (multiplets).

We assume here, and will assume repeatedly below, that a is the only characteristic microscopic size, therefore the volume of one monomer unit is a3.The value of Q, is related to the swelling ratio a by the equation

where A , is a numerical constant of order unity which is somewhat smaller than A , . The formation of each new physical crosslink is accompanied also by a loss in entropy, because two monomeric units involved in the crosslink are forced to be in the immediate vicinity of each other. Following analogous arguments by FloryI6)we can estimate the corresponding contribution to the free energy per each crosslink, Af, as follows
V/(v, + v )
A f = U l n ( a3 )
because M ( v o + v ) is the gel volume per each subchain. Thus,

since the number of physical crosslinks is equal to one half of the number v of new network subchains. The equations written above define completelythe free energy of a polymer network. It should be minimized with respect to the parameters a ,/Iand v to determine the equilibrium volume of the gel, concentration of bound counter ions and concentration of multiplets.
Gel collapse in the absence of multiplet formation
Let us consider first a special case when there is no association between ion pairs, i. e. v = 0. We will seethat all the main physical effects are relevant already for this case. The free energy of the network is described by the equations of the previous section with v = 0. The equilibrium values of a and /I can be found by minimization of the free energy with respect to a and p. Equilibrium conditions aF/aa = 0, aF/a/I = 0 lead to the following equations:

Analysis shows that the behavior of the network depends essentially on the ratio / E , of the dielectric constants of the dry gel and the solvent. If the ratio E , /eOis not very small accounting for the ion pair formation does not lead to a qualitative change of the behavior of the system in comparison with that obtained in refs.4*6) The characteristic dependence F ( a )for this case is shown in Fig. 2. It has two minima which correspond to the extended and collapsed states of the network. In a good solvent the free energy of the extended state is less than that of the collapsed state and the network swells essentially. In a poor solvent this relation is reversed and the network is in the globular state. The transition between the extended
and the collapsed state occurs at some critical value of solvent quality xcrk,, - 0,s

At the transition point the value of /3 increases in a jump-like fashion and then grows monotonically with further increase of x (seeFig. 3 b). Hence, the number of free counter ions decreases and so does the corresponding osmotic pressure. This fact results in a small decrease of a in comparison with what was obtained in the previous theories. / t ois smaller than some critical value much less than unity.

The occurrence of such supercollapsed state is a manifestation of the following avalanche-type process: the decrease of network volume causes a decrease of E and additional ion pair formation, thus, the osmotic pressure exerted by the counter ions decreases, which in turn leads to further shrinking of the gel and so on. This loop of positive feedback brings the gel quite close to the most dense conformation. Since for small values of E,/E,, the free energy generally has three minima, by changing external conditions it is possible to induce the conformational transitions between all three states of the network which correspond to these minima (extended gel, collapsed gel, supercollapsed densely packed gel). In particular, the collapse of the network can be realized as the sequence of two phase transitions. The corresponding dependences of a and /3 are shown in Fig. 5. When the solvent quality becomes poorer

the network first collapses to an intermediate state that corresponds to an ordinary collapsed gel, and then the avalanche process sets in and the gel further collapses to the supercollapsed state. Both transitions are jump-like first-order phase transitions. The second jump in the dependence a 01)in Fig. 5 a is not seen because the gel volumes in the collapsed and supercollapsed state are in fact close to each other. From this point of view proper scales in Fig. 4 are not preserved: the scale in the vicinity of the dense packing limit is much larger than for other values of a. However, two collapsed states are clearly distinguished by the values of p: in the usual collapsed gel p < 0,5 (see Fig. 5 b), i. e., more than half of all the counter ions are mobile, while in the supercollapsed gel p = 1 , i. e., practically all the counter ions form ion pairs. The latter distinction between collapsed and supercollapsed gel is characteristic of most of the cases for which our calculations have shown simultaneous existence of these two states.

It can be seen that due to the formation of ion pairs the collapse transition point shifts significantly to lower values of x, i. e. the region where the collapsed conformation is favourable increases.

Thus, by taking into account the possibility of ion pair formation and the dependence of the dielectric constant on the polymer volume fraction inside the gel it is possible to describe several new effects. The main qualitatively new phenomenon is the possibility of an avalanche-type process mentioned above which results in a gel collapsed to a superdense state close to the densely packed limit. Besides, there is a new regime in which the network undergoes two first-order phase transitions.
Gel collapse in the absence of dissociation of ions
Let us consider now another particular case for which p = 1, i.e., there is no dissociation of polar groups of the network. At the same time, we will account for the possibility of ion pair association, i. e. the formation of multiplets. In principle, the situation with /3 = 1 can be realized for gels swelling in an organic low polar solvent. However in this case the dielectric constant of the solvent E~ cannot be much larger than the dielectric constant of the dry gel E , . Thus, the ratio e l /eO is never too small and most of the qualitatively new features of the collapse transition cannot be realized. However,we perform the analysis of this section for arbitrary values of /eO for the sake of generality and for better understanding of the main physical features of the general case to be considered in the next section. If p = 1 the free energy defined above should be minimized with respect to a and v. Analysis shows that the minimum of the free energy with respect to v always corresponds either to v = ,,v = N/a or to v = 0. This fact, which remains true also for the general case, means that partial aggregation of ion pairs in the multiplets cannot

be realized: either all ion pairs do not aggregate with each other (v = 0) or all of them form multiplets (v = v,,). This fact is in accordance with the recent theory of mukiplet structure in ionomers I,). Sincethe minimum of the free energy with respect to v corresponds to the boundaries of the interval of possible values of v, we must check two boundary points v = 0 and v = vmaXto find the minimum. The condition aF/aa = 0 leads to the following equation:

where

At the boundary point v = 0the free energy is analogous to that of a neutral network; the function F ( a )has one minimum that shifts to the region of small a when the solvent becomes poorer. / E i~s small enough, one more minimum of the function F(a)appears near the highly collapsed densely-packed state. This is the case if

If v = v,,, and the ratio

The appearance of this supercollapsed state is due to a process analogous to that described in the previous section: the decrease of a causes a decrease of E and subsequent additional multiplet formation that induces further volume decreases. Thus, the loop of positive feedback due to the aggregation of multiplets is possible as well.
Analysis shows that at E , /c0 - A , * u , / r ~ ”th~e transition from the extended state (in which v = 0) to the supercollapsed state (in which v = v,,, = N / a ) takes place. So, the degree of ion pair association in multiplets changes in a jump-like fashion: in a good solvent in the extended state there are no multiplets inside the network, and in the supercollapsed state all the ions are included in the multiplets. Characteristic
dependences a or) for this case for different values of /E,, are shown in Fig. 7. With the decrease of the ratio /c0 the collapse transition point shifts to the region of good solvent, i. e. the region of the collapsed conformation increases, as it should be.
Gel collapse in the general case
Let us consider now the general case (p + 1 and v =k 0), where both partial ion dissociation and multiplet formation are taken into account. The free energy for this case is defined above; it should be minimized with respect to a, fl and v. The analysis shows that the free-energy minimum with respect to v always corresponds to one of two points v = ,,v = N / a or v = 0, as in the previous section. So,

In a good solvent the network is in the extended state and p 4 I , v = 0, i. e. practically all the polar groups are dissociated and multiplets are not formed. The main qualitative features of the collapse behavior for the general case remain the same as for the particular case considered above. The existence of the supercollapsed state remains possible, taking into account the possibility of multiplet

E , / E o < ( E l / E O ) c r - [ ( A , + A2)uo/a1”2 (28)
(cf. Eq. (21)). The conditions for the existence of the sequence of two phase transitions (extended gel -collapsed gel -supercollapsed gel) and for the direct collapse from the extended to the supercollapsed state are also modified for the general case in a similar way. However, no qualitatively new features of the collapse transition appear. For example, in Fig. 8 the characteristic dependences a h ) and POI) for different values of E , /eO are shown. For comparison, the corresponding curves 1a and 2a calculated without allowing ion pair aggregation are plotted as well. It can be seen that the region of the collapsed gel increases, if one takes into account the possibility of multiplet formation. For the set of parameters of Fig. 8, in the extended state P Q 1, v = 0, while in the collapsed state (which is in fact supercollapsed) /3 = 1, v = v,, = N/a.

can be very important for the collapse behavior of polyelectrolyte gels in poor solvents. In addition to the quantitative change of the parameters of the transition, two qualitatively new features appear: the possibility of avalanche-shrinking of the gel with the formation of a supercollapsed state and the possibility of realization of the sequence of two collapse transitions. Of course, the experimental check of these theoretical predictions would be very interesting. Therefore, it is worth-while to mention here several complications which appear when we turn to real systems. First, collapse transition is usually observed in mixed solvents. For this case we must take into account the redistribution of solvent composition inside the gel, i.e. the preferential adsorption of the better solvent inside the ge1l3*l4).We do not expect that accountig for this effect will lead to an essential change of the main conclusions of the present paper. Second, the linear interpolation formula (1) may be too crude. Other dependencies such as shown in Fig. 9 b may better correspond to the real situation. In this case the avalanche collapse with ion pair formation is possible only for dense enough gels. For example, this may be a phase transition between two collapsed states. Since the slope of the dependence E ( @ ) for the case of the curve b in Fig. 9 is large at 1 - @ 1, the probability of such a collapsed gel-supercollapsed gel phase transition is high. Third, the Flory-Huggins expression (7) for the free energy of interaction of monomeric units may be not applicable for the supercollapsed state which is close to the densely packed limit. In particular, this is the case for the common situation when the pure polymer is in the glassy state. For this case it is natural to expect that the avalanche process will stop due to the appearance of frozen-in structures at values of @ somewhat lower than the densely packed limit. The formation of a microdomain structure of the type described in ref. 2 1 ) is also possible.

The appearance of the multiplet structure in the collapsed gel can be confirmed, as usual in ionomer studies, by scattering measurements 'O). In this connection it is worth-while to mention a recent paperz2)where a peak in the angular dependence of the small-angle neutron scattering intensity of a polyelectrolyte gel in a poor solvent was observed. This peak was interpreted as evidence for the existence of microdomain

structures of the weakly charged polyelectrolytes in poor solvents predicted in theoretical paper^^^.'^). We would like to draw here the attention to the fact that the existence of a multiplet structure in poor solvents would also lead to the appearance of a scattering intensity peak. The same is true for recent experiments of polyelectrolyte solutions in poor solvent^^^^^^). Additional experiments are needed to clarify the situation. In spite of all the complications mentioned above we believe that the aggregation of ion pairs in multiplets is very essential for the phenomenon of collapse of polyelectrolyte gels, as well as for other effects of the physical chemistry of polyelectrolytes. The fact that the ion pairs are progressively formed as the polymer concentration becomes higher is quite general and should be taken into account also for other physical situations. Some examples of this kind will be described in other publications.
