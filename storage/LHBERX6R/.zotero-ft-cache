Silicon is considered as a promising candidate for anode materials due to its ultrahigh
theoretical capacity and natural abundance. However, the commercialization is severely
hampered by the large strain and short cycle life. Herein, we have synthesized a reversible
polyelectrolyte/polyzwitterion coacervate framework to achieve high-performance silicon
anodes with high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and stable cyclability. Such coacervate
framework is formed via in-situ free radical polymerization of zwitterionic 2-methacryloyloxy
ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) with polyacrylic acid (pAA) during heating the slurry. The
resulting pAA/pMPC coacervate framework presents excellent adhesion, thermal stability, and
negligible swelling in the electrolyte. Comparing with pAA, pAA/pMPC0.1 coacervate
framework binder exhibits superior performance during charge/discharge. The ICE is improved
from 84.41%, to 87.61%. After 250 cycles, the specific capacity of pAA/pMPC0.1 silicon anode
is 1678 mAh g-1 with a retention of 78% while the pAA silicon anode completely failed after
less than 200 cycles. Such improvement is ascribed to the structural integrity of the electrode
endowed by the self-healing ability of pAA/pMPC coacervate framework. This work not only
offers a feasible method to in-situ construct coacervate framework with self-healing capability

to achieve high-performance silicon anodes but also a compatible electrode preparation process
for other high-capacity materials.
1. Introduction
To meet the increasing demand for high-performance batteries, silicon is widely regarded as a
promising candidate for high-capacity anode.[1] Under ambient condition, the theoretical
specific capacity of silicon is 3580 mAh g-1, about ten times that of graphite. Under high
temperature environment, the completely lithiated silicon transforms into Li22Si5 alloy,
reaching a specific capacity as high as 4200 mAh g-1.[2] Different from intercalation chemistry
of lithium storage in graphite, the lithium storage mechanism of silicon originates from the
gradual alloying with lithium ions.[3] Though silicon possesses numerous advantages including
high specific capacity, safe lithiation potential (about 0.4 V vs. Li/Li+), and abundant reserves,
the practical application of silicon anodes has been severely hindered. Heretofore, the amount
of silicon doped in the composite anodes is stuck at a low level.[4] The main obstacles
encountered by silicon on the road to large-scale application are poor conductivity (6.7×10-4 S
cm-1), exaggerated strain (more than 300%)[5] and short cycle life. With the deepening of the
alloying degree, the accumulated stress leads to splintering of silicon particles, which causes
crack, pulverization and delamination at the electrode level.[6] During long-term
charge/discharge, the cyclic stress not only causes the loss of active materials, but also
consumes the electrolyte through the continuous growth of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI)
on exposed surface, and eventually the battery suffers from a rapid resistance increase and
capacity decline.[7]
The strategy to improve the performance of silicon anodes mainly stems from two aspects:
the structure design and surface modification of silicon materials, and the construction of
various networks to relieve stress and improve conductivity at the electrode level.[8] Design of
the nanostructure can effectively resist the particle breakage caused by stress and shorten the
diffusion distance of lithium ions inside the silicon.[9] Xiao et al. designed hierarchically porous
Si nanospheres, whose porous shell and hollow core structure successfully transferred the
volume expansion during alloying process to inward breathing, and significantly improved the
diffusion of lithium ions, thereby ameliorating the stability and rate of the silicon anodes.[10] At
the electrode level, the construction of the three-dimensional network can maintain the overall
mechanical and conductive integrity, which is undertook by binder in the electrode
component.[11] In terms of the source of the binder, polymeric binders are usually synthetic or
biomass. Some biomass materials with ultra-high molecular weight, such as sodium

carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, etc., have shown excellent performance as binders
on silicon anodes. Ling et al. proposed using okra gum to alleviate the failure of silicon
anodes[12]. Chen et al. took advantage of the hydrophilic properties of poly(methyl vinyl ether
alt-maleic acid) polymer to achieve uniform dispersion of electrode components[13]. Due to the
designability of the polymer structure, the binder can be given some more unique functions,
such as self-healing ability, by intentionally introducing various functional groups[14]. The
abundant hydrogen bonding sites on poly(ether-thioureas) chains enable cracks on silicon anode
generated during cycling to be reversibly repaired[15].Wang et al. proposed a self-healing binder
driven by hydrogen bonds, which can reversibly repair cracks and thus prolong battery life[16].
When advancing from mechanism exploration to industrial application, the practical feasibility
becomes a particularly important factor. Overly elaborate designs usually rely on complicated
synthesis and tough conditions, and issues such as compatibility with industrial production, cost,
and emissions need to be reconsidered.[17]
Herein, we propose a one-step synthesis method to construct in-situ
polyelectrolyte/polyzwitterion coacervate framework during the electrode preparation process,
which is proven to effectively improve the stability and conductivity of silicon anodes. As
shown in Figure 1, the zwitterionic monomer MPC is added into the anode slurry and
polymerized. More specifically, the water-soluble initiator 2,2-azobis(2
methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AIBA) decomposes into free radicals under heating
conditions, then initiates the C=C double bonds of the monomer MPC to polymerize into pMPC.
Simultaneously, the resulting pMPC coacervates with pAA to form a
polyelectrolyte/polyzwitterion framework. Thanks to the non-overlapping characteristics of the
positive and negative charge centers of zwitterions, many unexpected regulatory effects can be
achieved by introducing them into the battery system.[18] Margossian et al. revealed that the
dipole-driven self-assembly between charged macromolecules is based on electrostatic
attraction and entropy gain in complexation.[19] Such non-covalent and reversible interaction
transforms the linear network into a three-dimensional network, which can better buffer the
expansion during lithium storage and repair the resultant cracks.[20] From the perspective of
conductivity, the introduction of zwitterions can play a vital role as lithium ion dissociation
enhancers at the electrode/electrolyte interface to facilitate ionic conduction.[21] This
environmentally benign method employs water as the reaction solvent without scruple of
organic solvents emission. In addition, such one-step synthesis design features high practical
feasibility due to outstanding compatibility with industrial production process.

2. Results and discussion
In this work, the zwitterionic monomer MPC was synthesized into pMPC by free radical
polymerization with 2,2-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride as the initiator under
heating conditions. To verify the polymerization, 1H-NMR was carried out to investigate the
chemical environment of hydrogen before and after the reaction. As shown in Figure 2a, it can
be observed from the 1H-NMR spectrum that the multiple peaks with chemical shifts around
1.80 ppm correspond to methylene protons of pAA, while the asymmetric peaks with chemical
shifts around 2.45 ppm correspond to methine protons. It is worth noting that the protons of the
hydroxyl groups cannot be observed since active hydrogens do not have peaks in protic solvents
including deuterated water. In terms of zwitterions, the single peak signal with a chemical shift
of 3.23 ppm originates from the quaternary ammonium group, while four peaks with chemical
shifts in the range of 3.56-4.37 ppm correspond to the methylene protons at four different
positions on the zwitterion side chain.[22] Importantly, the convincing evidence of
polymerization is the phenomenon that two peaks of zwitterionic monomer MPC at chemical
shift of 5.64 and 6.07ppm, which are attributed to protons on ethylenic bond, vanish after
heating. The integral calculation of the chemical shift peak of the 1H-NMR spectrum showed

that the conversion of monomer MPC exceeds 98%, indicating that this thermally initiated free
radical polymerization reaction is highly efficient. Further, the interaction between
polyzwitterionic pMPC and polyelectrolyte pAA needs to be revealed in detail. Figure S1
shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of pure pAA, pure pMPC and pAA/pMPC, respectively. The
absorbance bands at 1707 cm-1 in pAA spectrum can be traced to C=O stretching region, peaks
at 957, 1072, and 1257 cm-1 in pMPC spectrum are attributed to P-O phosphate group, and peak
at 1707 cm-1 comes from ketone group[23]. While it’s clear to identify the characteristic peaks
of the two polymers, no new absorbance peak in pAA/pMPC spectrum is observed in the
fingerprint area, indicating that the interaction between these two polymers cannot be ascribed
to the generation of covalent bonds. When it comes to wavenumber range of 3000-3500cm-1, it
can be observed that the signal of the absorbance bands has been enhanced, indicating that the
interaction between molecules is charge attraction. The side chains of polymers are extremely
polar due to the tendency of the charge distribution on the functional groups. In detail, the
negative-charged carboxyl group of pAA and positive-charged quaternary ammonium group of
pMPC attracts and interacts with each other. Driven by this dipolar interaction, the two
polymers coacervate and construct a framework.

Figure 2b shows the photographs of alkali and acid titration of pAA/pMPC coacervate
framework in sequence. As the pH increases, the dipole interaction between chains attenuates
even disappears, and the original emulsion-like coacervate framework transforms into
transparent linear network. When pH is titrated by acid to original value, the uniform coacervate
framework is reversibly recurrent. This pH-dependent and reversible behavior is the typical
feature of coacervates. Such behavior is further confirmed by the aqueous GPC results. The
calibration curves of pAA/pMPC framework with different ratios in Figure S2 all contain
merely single main peaks, which indicate that pAA/pMPC flowed through the gel column as a
whole. Table S1 shows that as the content of pMPC increased from 0% to 10%, the weight
average molecular weight increased from 8.3 k Daltons to 20.9 k Daltons, and the polydispersity
decreased from 3.00 to 1.87. Higher and more uniformly-distributed molecular weight is
undoubtedly beneficial for the stability of silicon anodes, since more dense wrapping of silicon
particles and conductive additives and tighter interchain entanglement between chains are
achieved, thereby more efficiently stabilizing the interface and buffering expansion. However,
when the pMPC content increased to 20%, the molecular weight and polydispersity of the
coacervate framework regressed slightly. Nakai et al. previously found that zwitterionic
copolymers could self-assemble and transform into nanoscale unilamellar vesicles using cryo
transmission electron microscopy when the ion concentration of the environment is reduced[24].
A similar scenario may also occur in pAA/pMPC coacervate framework. Due to the decrease
of pAA content, the original uniform network with micrometer scale collapses into pMPC
centered nanovesicles, resulting in decline of molecular weight and degradation of mechanical
properties which will be discussed in the following sections.

Small swelling rate and high mechanical and thermal stability of the polymer binders in
the electrolyte are highly desirable to maintain the structure integrity of silicon anodes which
are continuously subjected to enormous cyclic stress during charge/discharge. Large swelling
can not only significantly reduce the strength and modulus of polymer binder but also
deteriorate the cell performance in the case of the lean electrolyte. The pAA/pMPC samples
with different ratios were made into thin films and soaked in electrolyte for 48 hours at 25°C to
calculate the swelling rate. The results in Figure 3a show that the swelling rate of pAA/pMPC
coacervate framework decreases significantly with the increase of pMPC content. Specifically,
the swelling rates of samples with 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20% pMPC content were 7.4%, 3.1%,
2.2%, and 1.2% in sequence (three replicate samples for each group). The swelling inhibition
of polyzwitterionic pMPC might be explained by the formation of pAA/pMPC coacervate
framework and its low solvation. When the charged hydrophilic groups on the side chains of
pMPC are impregnated in the low polar DMC solvent, due to the low affinity at the interface,
the diffusion of solvent molecules into the polymer skeleton is hindered, thus achieving the low
swelling properties of the pAA/pMPC framework. In order to ensure the integrity of the
electrode during charge/discharge, the polymer framework not only shoulders the duty to wrap
the active material and conductive additives, but also achieve robust adhesion between each
component and the current collector. The 180° electrode peeling test was performed to evaluate
the effect of the introduction of pMPC on the adhesion force to current collector. Figure 3b
shows that in the relatively low content range, the amount of pMPC introduced is positively
correlated with the adhesion force of the electrode. Specifically, the maximum adhesion force
of pAA, pAA/pMPC0.05, pAA/pMPC0.1 silicon anode is 2.2, 2.8, 6.0 N, and the average
adhesion force in displacement range of 50 mm is 1.0, 2.2, 3.1 N, respectively. This can be
explained that as the content of pMPC increases, the degree of coacervate deepens, and denser
dipole attraction between molecular chains builds a more compact three-dimensional network
within the electrode, thereby achieving a significant increase in adhesion force. It is noticeable
that the maximum and average adhesion force of the pAA/pMPC0.2 shows a significant
landslide of 1.7 and 0.6N, respectively. The reduction in molecular weight directly contributes
to the attenuation of adhesion effect, since interchain entanglement is no longer as effective.
Furthermore, the adhesion force of pAA/pMPC0.2 is even lower than that of pure pAA, which
is also conjectured to be related to the spontaneous contraction of polyzwitterion posture into
vesicles under low ion concentration environment.
Excellent thermal stability is an effective guarantee for battery safety. The
thermogravimetric curves of Figure 3c show that pMPC is the key factor to increase the

decomposition temperature of the coacervate framework. In an argon atmosphere, pAA began
to experience a decrease in mass retention at 150 °C, suggesting the onset of decomposition,
till the decomposition rate reached a maximum at 380 °C. As compared with pAA, the
decomposition temperature of pAA/pMPC coacervate framework was increased to 270, 290,
and 230°C when the content of pMPC increased from 5%, 10% to 20%. The improvement of
thermal stability comes from the introduction of flame-retardant element phosphorus, which
has a great improvement effect on ensuring the safe charge/discharge of batteries. the
introduction of pMPC. On the one hand, the interaction brought by pMPC increases the binding
energy of the coacervate framework, thereby promoting its decomposition temperature and
thermal stability. On the other hand, the synergistic flame-retardant effect of nitrogen and
phosphorus elements in pMPC molecules ensures the safe charge/discharge of batteries.

silicon anodes compared with pAA anodes, which means that the pAA/pMPC coacervate
framework can maintain excellent electrochemical stability within the working potential
window of the electrode without redox decomposition. In the negative scan after activation, two
significant reduction peaks appeared at 0.18 and 0.01V, which is the phase transition process
from crystalline silicon to lithiated silicon (LixSi).[25] In the positive scan, the two oxidation
peaks at 0.33 and 0.51V represent the dealloying during delithiation and the transformation of
silicon to amorphous state.[26] In more detail, higher reduction peak potentials and larger peaks
were observed for the two components pAA/pMPC0.1 and pAA/pMPC0.2, implying that a high
content of pMPC reduces polarization and improves kinetics, similar to the results of first scan
in Figure S3. Figure 4b shows the potential curves of the first charge/discharge of the silicon
anode. Notably, pMPC significantly improves the charge/discharge capacity of the silicon
anode. The first discharge capacity of pAA/pMPC0.1 is as high as 3139 mAh g-1, while that of
pAA silicon anode is only 2529 mAh g-1. By analysing the potential curves, it can be found that
the introduction of pMPC can advance the electrode into the lithium intercalation/extraction
platform, indicating that the polarization is suppressed, which is consistent with the CV results.
For high-capacity and huge-strain anode material like silicon, the initial Coulombic efficiency
(ICE) is critical to achieve high-energy full cells because it reflects the consumption of active
lithium inventory to grow the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). High ICE means that the
formed SEI is thin and uniform and the side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface is
mitigated so that more lithium ions survive and participate in subsequent cycles, achieving high
stability. Figure 4c counts ICE of pAA, pAA/pMPC0.05, pAA/pMPC0.1, pAA/pMPC0.2 (three
replicate samples for each group) as 84.41%, 87.49%, 87.61% and 88.32%, respectively. It can
be interpreted that the charged groups on the side chains of the polyzwitterion promote the
dissociation of lithium ions, thus improving the conduction of lithium ions and enhancing the
ICE. The EIS spectra in Fig.4d further confirm such presumption. The inset picture is the fitting
of the equivalent circuit. The impedance of the electrode has clear negative correlation with the
content of pMPC, the charge transfer impedance (Rct) of pAA, pAA/pMPC0.05, pAA/pMPC0.1,
pAA/pMPC0.2 are 8.0, 6.4, 5.7, 4.3 Ohm respectively.
Since the molecular chain posture is related to the concentration of ions in the environment,
the mechanical properties of the pAA/pMPC coacervate framework only benefit from the
pMPC content in a certain range, while in the electrochemical aspect, the conductivity of the
pAA/pMPC silicon anode is directly related to the quantity of charged groups on side chain. In
the galvanostatic charge/discharge and rate evaluation which performed to evaluate to practical
capability of silicon anodes, the mechanical and electrical properties of the pAA/pMPC

coacervate framework need a compromise to achieve the optimal performance. Figure 5a
shows galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling test of different ratios of pAA/pMPC coacervate
framework silicon anodes at 0.2C. After 150 cycles, the capacities of pAA/pMPC0.05,
pAA/pMPC0.1 and pAA/pMPC 0.2 anodes decrease from 2788 to 1532 mAh g-1, 2765 to 1819
mAh g-1 and 2604 to 1204 mAh g-1 respectively, and the retention are 55%, 66% and 46%,
while the capacity of pAA decrease from 2566 to 742 mAh g-1 with a retention of less than 29%.
It is worthy to point out that the pAA/pMPC0.2 silicon anode suffers from a non-negligible
decline in capacity, which is due to the weak mechanical strength not enough to withstand the
huge cyclic stress. In order to analyse the electrode evolution during cycling in detail, the first
50 cycles of all the anodes were tracked. Figure 5b-e record the differential capacity curves of
pAA/pMPC0.1 and pAA silicon anodes in the first 50 cycles. Apparently, after 50 cycles,
pAA/pMPC0.1 showed obvious superiority in both electrochemical stability and activity.
Comparing the peak shift and peak value of the differential curves of the two samples, it can be
judged that pAA/pMPC0.1 inhibited the polarization and improved the kinetics at the same time.
As shown in Figure 5f, pAA/pMPC0.1 exhibited excellent kinetics and recovery ability in the
rate test. When the rate increases from 0.1C to 0.2C, 0.5C, and 1C, the average delithiation
capacity of pAA/pMPC0.1 is 3096, 2715, 2258, 1722 mAh g-1, while the pAA silicon anode is
only 2385, 2100, 1666, 1194 mAh g-1. Moreover, when the rate was returned to 0.1C, 94% of
the capacity of the pAA/pMPC0.1 silicon anode was recovered, while pAA was only 87%. As
shown in Fig.S4, the Rct of pAA/pMPC0.1 reduces to 4.1 Ohm after entering a stable stage,
indicating that pAA/pMPC can assist in the formation of a thin and uniform SEI and maintain
its electrochemical stability during cycling. In order to further reveal the reason that the
introduction of pMPC can improve the rate performance of silicon anode, as shown in Figure
S5, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was carried out to measure the
diffusion coefficient of lithium ions in the silicon anode. Figure S6 shows that the diffusion
coefficient of the pAA/pMPC0.1 silicon anode has been improved, which means that the
insertion and extraction of lithium ions are smoother, and the silicon anode has achieved
superior rate performance as the result. The prolonged galvanostatic charge/discharge cycle test
at 0.5C is also consistent with the above results. The pAA/pMPC0.1 anode shows better
performance than pAA/pMPC0.05 and pAA/pMPC0.2 anodes. As shown in Fig.5g, the
delithiation specific capacities of pAA/pMPC0.05, pAA/pMPC0.1, pAA/pMPC0.2 silicon anode
after 250 cycles of charge/discharge are 1534, 1678, 786 mAh g-1 with the retention of 67%,
78%, and 39%, respectively. Conversely, the pAA silicon anode completely failed after less
than 200 cycles.

Figure 6. SEM images of top-view (a-h) and cross-section (i-l) of pAA, pAA/pMPC0.05,
pAA/pMPC0.1 and pAA/pMPC0.2 silicon anodes after 50 cycles.
In order to elucidate the effect of the pAA/pMPC coacervate framework on the
aforementioned electrochemical performance of silicon anodes, the morphology of the silicon
electrodes before and after cycling has been investigated by SEM. As compared with the images
before cycling (Figure S7), the surfaces of pAA, pAA/pMPC0.05, pAA/pMPC0.1 and
pAA/pMPC0.2 silicon anodes after 50 cycles are obviously covered with SEI (Figure 6a-d).
The low magnification images demonstrate relatively comprehensive and direct electrode
integrity. The surface of the pAA anode exhibits severe cracking, up to 7.43 μm in size, after
continuous exposure to cyclic strain. In contrast, pAA/pMPC0.05 and pAA/pMPC0.1 maintain an
intact electrode surface, and there are no visible cracks on the anode surface of pAA/pMPC0.1,
which not only comes from the three-dimensional network of polyelectrolyte/polyzwitterion
coacervate framework to resist the fracture, but also could be attributed to reversible dipole
interaction between pAA and pMPC molecular chains which achieved self-healing towards the
crack. Cracks also appeared on the surface of pAA/pMPC0.2 anode to some extent after cycling,
because the over-concentrated coacervate sites were insufficient to buffer the strain caused by
lithium intercalation, so that the mechanical damage accumulated to the point of irreversibility.
The images in Figure 6e-h under larger magnification provide more features of the cycled
electrodes. Regarding the linear pAA, silicon particles are irreversibly agglomerated and
gradually fall off from the conductive network, which eventually leads to a rapid decline in the

capacity of the silicon anode. Conversely, pAA/pMPC0.05 and pAA/pMPC0.1 still maintain the
uniform and dense distribution of silicon particles, conductive additives and coacervate
framework at the microscopic level, thus preventing the generation of cracks on the
macroscopic level. Fig.6i-l shows the cross-sectional images of the silicon anode after 50 cycles,
which clearly exhibit the difference in thickness and interior structure of the silicon anodes. The
thickness of the pAA reached 43.6 μm after cycling, and the expansion rate was 404% in
thickness, while the expansion rates of the pAA/pMPC0.05, pAA/pMPC0.1 and pAA/pMPC0.2
anodes were reduced to less than 260%. In addition, the structures of pAA and pAA/pMPC0.2
became loose and porous after cycling due to the lack of robust coacervate framework and
stable SEI, while the the pAA/pMPC0.05 and pAA/pMPC0.1 anodes maintained a compact
structure.In addition to mechanical properties, excellent chemical stability is essential for
adhesives. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy in Figure S8 shows the changes in element
valence states before and after cycling of the silicon anode to track the chemical evolution of
the polymer pMPC in the electrode. More specifically, the P 2p spectrum of the phosphorus
element uniquely contained in pMPC is analyzed in detail in Figure S9. Since pAA anode does
not contain phosphorus element, no signal can be observed in the spectrum. However, the
spectrum of pristine pAA/pMPC0.1 anode only shows an obvious single peak at 134.2 eV. This
peak is a typical phosphate functional group and can be attributed to -PO4-- group in polymer
pMPC, which is highly consistent with the experimental results. After 50 charge/discharge
cycles, pAA anode shows two peaks at 133.8 eV and 136.7 eV, corresponding to LixPEy and
LixPOyFz in SEI respectively. Both of them originate from the decomposition of LiPF6 in the
electrolyte during the initial cycle, which is the process of SEI growing on the surface of the
anode. The above three peaks appeared simultaneously in pAA/pMPC0.1 anode after cycling.
The -PO4-- signal remains highly consistent before and after cycling, proving the excellent
stability of pMPC in the electrode. The phosphorus-containing component in SEI is the
decomposition products of LiPF6 in the same manner.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed an in-situ method to construct the pAA/pMPC coacervate
framework during the preparation of silicon anodes. The pAA/pMPC coacervate framework
shows small swelling rate and good adhesion, which are extremely important to maintain the
mechanical stability of the electrode. The electrochemical test results showed that the
introduction of polyzwitterionic pMPC greatly enhanced the cell ICE rate capability and cycling
life. Such improvement benefits from the three-dimensional network of polymers formed by

the reversible dipole interaction between polyelectrolytes and polyzwitterions. The postmortem
morphology analysis of the cycled battery further verified that the pAA/pMPC coacervate
framework enhance the structural integrity of the silicon anodes. Taking water solvent into
account, the in-situ method developed in this work is environmentally benign and compatible
with the current electrode preparation process which also provide a feasible path to
accommodate the large volume change of other high-capacity active materials.
4. Experimental Section
Materials: Monomer 2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), Initiator 2,2-azobis
(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AIBA) and polyacrylic acid (pAA) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Silicon nanoparticles (average particle size of ~100 nm),
ketjen black, were obtained from MTI Corporation (China). Electrolyte of 1M lithium
hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved in dimethyl carbonate (DMC): fluoroethylene
carbonate (FEC) (3:1 vol.) was purchased from Dodo Chem (China). All materials above were
used as received without further purification.
Preparationof pAA/pMPC framework silicon anode: Taking pAA/pMPC0.1 framework as an
example, to prepare aqueous precursor of coacervate framework, 4.5g pAA and 0.5g zwitterion
monomer MPC were mixed together and dissolved in 45mL deionized water, followed by
adding 9.15mg AIBA as a water-soluble initiator. It is worth emphasizing that the weight ratio
of pAA to MPC is adjustable according to different sample groups, while the ratio of
zwitterionic monomer to initiator is fixed at a molar ratio of 50:1. The electrode preparation
process is synchronized with the construction of the coacervate framework. Silicon
nanoparticles as active materials, ketjen black as conductive additive and pAA/MPC/AIBA as
binder were mixed at weight ratio of 70:15:15 using a Thinky mixer to prepare slurry with
uniform dispersion and moderate viscosity. The slurry was then cast on the copper foil current
collector by scraper with a specific thickness and then stored in argon-filled atmosphere at 80 °C
for 2h to initiate the polymerization and coacervate. After the reaction, the electrodes were
vacuum-dried overnight at 120°C, rolled and cut into discs with a diameter of 13 mm for
subsequent cell assembly and testing. In the galvanostatic charge/discharge test, the silicon
loading of the 0.2C cycle electrode is 0.8-1.0 mg cm-2, the 0.5C cycle is 0.7-0.8 mg cm-2, and
the silicon loading of the rate test is 0.6-0.7 mg cm-2.

Characterization: 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy of samples were
recorded in deuterated water by Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Germany). Molecular weight
and polydispersity of polymers were measured by aqueous gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) Agilent PL-GPC220 (USA). Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared
(ATR-FTIR) spectra were recorded on Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer
(USA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed in nitrogen at heating speed of
10 °C/min between 30 to 800 °C with PerkinElmer STA 8000 (USA). To meticulously observe
the morphology of the electrodes and analyse the elements on the surface, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) Zeiss Sigma 300 (Germany) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
Thermo Scientific K-Alpha (USA) were carried out.
Electrochemical measurements: The pre-prepared disc anodes were transferred to an argon
filled glove box (water, oxygen content <0.5 ppm) and assembled into CR2032 half cells. 25
μL of electrolyte was dropped on both sides of Celgard 2500 polypropylene separator, and metal
lithium was used as the counter electrode. After assembly, the coin cells were left to stand
overnight until the electrolyte fully infiltrated inside silicon anode and then could be used for
testing. Battery testing system Neware CT2001A (China) and electrochemical workstation Bio
Logical VMP3 (France) were employed to test the electrochemical performance of pAA/pMPC
coacervate framework silicon anodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was operated in
the voltage range of 0.001–2 V at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s-1. Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) was measured within the frequency range from 10mHz to 100kHz.
Galvanostatic charge/discharge and rate test were both at the potential range of 0.01-1.2V and
followed by cycles of activation at 0.05C. All the electrochemical tests mentioned above were
conducted in a 25°C incubator.
