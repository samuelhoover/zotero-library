ABSTRACT
We report the observation of sharp volume phase transition in the non-ionic N-isopropylacrylamide gel. The finding demonstrates that the phase transition of gels may be general and not confined to ionic gels as was previously considered. It will allow us to separate the electrostatic effects and network-structural effects on the phase transition.
INTRODUCTION
Several polymer gels having ionizable groups are known to undergo a discontinuous volume change upon chanaes in temperature 1,2 , solvent composition 3-6 , pH 3 , or ionic composition/. The volume change was also induced by applying a small electric field across an ionized ge1 8 . These phenomena can be interpreted as a phase transition 2,3,9 . This view is supported by observation of critical phenomena in the concentration fluctuations of the polymer network measured by the technique of laser light scattering spectroscopy 10,12. In this paper we report the preliminary studies on a sharp volume phase transition in the non-ionic N-isopropylacrylamide gel (whether it is discontinuous or not needs more precise experiments). We compare these results with the transition in a non-ionic acrylamide gel which has a continuous volume change. Theoretical considerations show that whether a gel undergoes a continuous volume change or a first order discontinuous phase transition depends on the proportion of ionizable groups incorporated in the polymer network and on the stiffness of the polymer chains constituting the network 3,9 . The counterions to the ionized groups and the stiffness of the polymer chains increase the osmotic pressure acting to expand the polymer network, resulting in a discontinuous volume change. This situation is similar to a gas-liquid phase transition which can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the external pressure exerted on the system.
SAMPLE PREPARATION
The N-isopropylacrylamide and acrylamide gels were prepared by free radical polymerization. N-isopropylacrylamide monomer was synthesized from acryloyl chloride and isopropylamine, and purified by distillation, followed by recrystallization from a mixture of petroleum ether and toluene. The purity of the monomer was found to be more than 99.9% by -gas chromatography. In particular, we did not find any acrylic acid in the monomer. Five grams of N-isopropylacrylamide and 0.133g of N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide, the crosslink

ing molecules, were dissolved in pure water to a final volume of 100m1, to which were added 20mg of ammonium persulfate (initiator) and 20mg of sodium bisulfate (accelerator). The gels were made in micropipettes of inner diameter 1.35mm at room temperature and allowed to react for one day. The gels were then removed from the micropipettes and immersed in pure water for one day to wash away unreacted monomers from the polymer network. Finally, the gels were cut into pieces 5mm long to be used in the swelling experiments. The equilibrium time for swelling took from several hours to several days depending on the particular solvent composition used. The same preparation process was employed for the acrylamide gels using the same molar amount of acrylamide as N-isopropylacrylamide. The acrylamide monomer (Biorad, electrophoresis grade) was used without any further purification.
SWELLING EXPERIMENTS
In Figure la the degree of swelling of the N-isopropylacrylamide and acrylamide gels is plotted as a function of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) volume percent in mixtures of DMSO and water. The N-isopropylacrylamide gel immersed in mixtures of DMSO composition from 0 to 33 volume percent is slightly swollen compared to the original volume. Above 34% DMSO this gel is collapsed into a compact state. The transition around 33% DMSO is sharp. Above 90% DMSO the gel shows another sharp reswelling. The detailed analysis of this reentry phenomenon will be reported elsewhere13. On the other hand, the acrylamide gel shows only a small amount of swelling with no discontinuity. We also investigated the swelling equilibrium of the N-isopropylacrylamide gel in pure water as a function of temperature. The result is shown in Figure lb. At low temperatures the gel is swollen, at high temperatures the gel is collapsed. There is a sharp volume transition at approximately 35.0°C. This behavior is in contrast to the ionized acrylamide gels which are swollen at high temperatures2. The total entropy of the gel (polymer network and solvent) must increase at high temperatures. However, the entropy of the polymer network decreases upon its collapse into a more compact and ordered state. The decrease in entropy of the network must be compensated by the entropy increase associated with the solvent molecules, presumably accomplished by the destruction of the solvation structure of water molecules in the vicinity of the polymer chains. Such a reversed temperature dependence was also found in N,N-diethylacrylamide-sodium methacrylate copolymer gels by Ilavsky, Hrouz and Ulbrich6.
MEAN-FIELD-THEORETICAL CONSIDERATION
The phase transition of a gel can be understood in terms of mean field formula for the osmotic pressure, Ir of a gel originally derived by Flory and Huggins14.

where N is Avogadro's number, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, v is the molar volume of the solvent, 0 is the volume fraction of the network, AF is the free energy decrease associated with the formation of a contact between polymer segments, 0 0 is the volume fraction of the network at the condition the constituent polymer chains have random-walk configurations, v is the number of constituent chains per unit volume at 0=0 0 , and f is the number of counterions per effective chain. Here we include the effect of ionization in order to examine the possible elements which determine the discreteness of the gel phase transition. The osmotic pressure difference between the inside and outside of the gel must be zero for the gel to be in equilibrium with the surrounding solvent. Zero osmotic pressure difference is also necessary for the free energy of the gel, F, to be minimized, since W= -DF/DV, where V is the volume of the gel. The degree of swelling is given by

where Vo is the volume of the gel at 0=0 0 . From Equation (1), this condition may be expressed as

where the parameter T, the reduced temperature, varies with temperature and solvent composition. Equations (2) and (3) then determine the equilibrium gel volume and polymer network concentration as a function of the reduced temperature. For certain values of the reduced temperature, however, Equation (3) is satisfied by three values of 0, corresponding to two minima and one maximum of the free energy. The value of 0 corresponding to the lower minimum represents the equilibrium value. A discrete volume transition occurs when the two free-energy minima have the same value. The criterion which determines whether a volume change of a gel is discontinuous or continuous can be seen by expanding the logarithmic
term ln(1-0 in Equation (3), retaining terms up to order 0.

Equation (4) is the equation of state of the gel, i.e., the relationship between the renoramlized reduced temperature, t, and the renormalized concentration, p. In this approximation, the equation of state is determined by a single parameter S. The parameter S solely determines whether a volume change is continuous or discontinuous. The ratio of the two volumes at either side of the discontinuous transition is also only a function of S. A microscopic interpretation of the parameter S can be seen by the following simple argument2. Let the single polymer chain consist of n freelyjointed segments of radius a and persistent length b. Then, the rms end-to-end distance of the single polymer chain is Ribn1/2b. Since R is also the rms distance between neighboring crosslinks, we see that v0niba2/R3, and 0n.,Nba2/R3. From these relations we have
S = (b/a)4(2f+1)4. (8)
Equation (8) shows that the S-value depends on two elements, the number of ionized groups per chain, f, and the ratio of persistent length, b, to the effective radius of the polymer chain, a. The ratio b/a reflects the stiffness of the chain. Equation (8) reveals that the S-value changes very rapidly with f and b/a. In order for a gel to have a large S-value and thus to undergo a discontinuous phase transition, the constituent polymer chains must have sufficient stiffness and/or a sufficient amount of ionized groups. We have seen that the gels of acrylamide and N,N-diethylacrylamide undergo continuous volume change without ionizable groups3,6. The volume change becomes discontinuous when ionizable groups are incorporated into the network, indicating the polymer chains of these gels are not stiff enough. The S-value becomes large only when f is increased. N-isopropylacry1amide polymer chains apparently have sufficient stiffness due to the bulky isopropyl groups so the ratio b/a is in itself large enough to induce a discontinuous transition.
CONCLUSION
The findings presented in this report demonstrate that the phase transition of gels is general and not confined to ionic gels. They also indicate the importance of the specific chemical composition of the gel network and solvent. Further study of the phase transition in non-ionic gels is required to allow us to separate the effect of polymer network structure from that of charge. In addition to its scientific importance, an understanding of the volume transition in gels will hasten the application of gel technology to switches, sensors, memories, display units, and mechano-chemical transducers.
