Abstract
Helicases and remodeling enzymes are ATP-dependent motor proteins that play a critical role in every aspect of RNA and DNA metabolism. Most RNA-remodeling enzymes are members of helicase superfamily 2 (SF2), which includes many DNA helicase enzymes that display similar structural and mechanistic features. Although SF2 enzymes are typically called helicases, many of them display other types of functions, including single-strand translocation, strand annealing, and protein displacement. There are two mechanisms by which RNA helicase enzymes unwind RNA: The nonprocessive DEAD group catalyzes local unwinding of short duplexes adjacent to their binding sites. Members of the processive DExH group often translocate along single-stranded RNA and displace paired strands (or proteins) in their path. In the latter case, unwinding is likely to occur by an active mechanism that involves Brownian motor function and stepwise translocation along RNA. Through structural and single-molecule investigations, researchers are developing coherent models to explain the functions and dynamic motions of helicase enzymes.

THE BIOLOGICAL ROLE OF SF2 RNA AND DNA HELICASES
Helicase superfamily 2 (SF2) is a phylogenetically distinct (26) and ubiquitous group of ATP-dependent nucleic acid–remodeling proteins that are involved in almost every
aspect of cellular metabolism (11, 41). Almost all RNA helicases (18) and a considerable number of DNA helicases fall within this designation (4, 39), which was originally based on protein sequence. There is no aspect of RNA metabolism that does not involve an SF2 motor protein (33), and related SF2 proteins are required for DNAremodeling processes that occur during transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin rearrangement (4, 24, 50). Like the SF1 DNA helicases, to which they are structurally and phylogenetically similar, SF2 helicases function as monomers or dimers on nucleic acid (33), and they have not been shown to form the hexameric rings that typify other helicase families. While new roles are continually being identified for members of the SF2 family, certain biological functions are believed to be particularly important. RNA remodeling is usually catalyzed by a phylogenetically distinct subfamily known as the DExH/D proteins, which are named for the sequence of conserved helicase motif II. DExH/D proteins play direct roles during translation initiation, ribosome biogenesis, RNA splicing, microRNA function, RNA transport, replication by RNA viruses, and many other processes that have been carefully described in recent reviews (9, 18). The most well-characterized SF2 DNA-remodeling proteins fall into two major categories: the RecQ family of DNA helicases and the Snf2 family of chromatin-remodeling proteins [although other forms, such as RecG and the Type 1 restriction enzymes, also represent important examples (63, 66)]. The RecQ proteins are essential for the maintenance of DNA integrity, and mutant forms of these proteins, such as the human Werner’s (Wrn) and Bloom’s Syndrome (Blm) helicases, are linked to cancer predisposition and aging (4). Chromatin-remodeling proteins such as ISWI and Snf2 translocate on duplex DNA and catalyze chromatin rearrangements important for transcription and

STRUCTURAL FORM AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY OF THE SF2-REMODELING PROTEINS
The phylogenetic and structural relationships among SF2 proteins have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (14, 18, 30, 62). However, an understanding of major features is helpful when considering the mechanisms of RNA and DNA remodeling, which is the major emphasis of this article. Originally described by Bork & Koonin (11), and more recently refined by Rocak & Linder (57), remodeling proteins of the SF2 group can be readily identified through a set of at least seven conserved sequence motifs (Figure 1). These motifs are arranged sequentially in sequence space and they comprise residues essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (motifs I, II, VI, and Q), nucleic acid substrate binding and translocation (motifs Ia, Ib, IV, and V), and for coupling ATP hydrolysis to remodeling events such as unwinding (motif III). The conserved motif

amino acids cluster at the cleft between Domains 1 and 2 (D1 and D2) of the protein, which forms the site of ATP binding and hydrolysis (Figure 2, in which NS3 is used as an example). In terms of three-dimensional architecture, D1 and D2 are structurally invariant among SF2 and SF1 proteins, and they are superimposable with RecA fold domains. Nucleic acid interacts on the top of D1 and D2, above the ATP-binding cleft and in a position that commonly involves other protein domains or bound cofactors (Figure 2).
FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF SF2-REMODELING PROTEINS
It is unfortunate that SF2 proteins were originally designated helicases because they display a diversity of mechanical functions that contribute to cellular metabolism (33). Depending on the influence of auxiliary domains and bound cofactors, the SF2 core can catalyze different types of conformational changes and nucleic acid rearrangements. Many members of the DExH family display processive single-strand translocation, which underlies their basic mechanism for helicase activity (22, 37, 52). By contrast, the DEAD members are strong,

ATP-dependent RNA-binding proteins that do not appear to translocate along nucleic acids. Instead, these proteins act as simple switches that can catalyze duplex annealing or displacement, depending on the protein, the reaction conditions, and the hydrolysis state of bound nucleotide (73, 75). Many members of the SF2 family have evolved to function not as helicases, but as protein displacement enzymes that facilitate the remodeling of large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (32). Others help catalyze the tertiary structural folding of large RNA molecules (56). Some of the most interesting adaptations are found in the Snf2 family of chromatin-remodeling proteins, in which the SF2 core has evolved to translocate along DNA duplexes without unwinding them (50). The phylogenetically defined family of SF2 helicases is a diverse group of adaptable motor proteins that contribute to all aspects of cellular function.
We therefore refer to them as remodeling proteins rather than helicases. For purposes of this review, we focus on the DExH/D subgroup of SF2, as this group contains almost all known RNA-remodeling proteins and helicases and many proteins that are important for DNA metabolism (33). Indeed, mechanisms for RNA translocation and helicase activity by DExH group members are almost identical to those observed for many DNA helicases, so a distinction between the two is somewhat arbitrary. Mechanistic distinctions between SF1 and SF2 may also be arbitrary, which is underscored by the SF1 designation for the Upf1 group of RNA helicases (17). It is useful, however, to distinguish the processive DExH subgroup of RNA remodeling from the nonprocessive DEAD subgroup, as they utilize two distinct mechanisms for unwinding and interacting with RNA substrates (73).

PROCESSIVE SF2 HELICASES: THE MOLECULAR BASIS FOR TRANSLOCATION AND UNWINDING
Molecular Recognition Between Helicases and Their Substrates
The DExH RNA-remodeling proteins unwind duplex substrates that are flanked by a single-stranded 3′-overhang, which is required for productive loading of the helicase (34, 54). This preference for a specific loading-strand polarity has long suggested that DExH helicases translocate and unwind RNA with a defined directionality, from 3′ to 5′ with respect to the loading strand, and this has now been demonstrated through diverse experimental approaches. Even the nonprocessive DEAD group (DEAD-box proteins) of SF2 RNA helicases (such as Mss116 and Ded1), which tolerate a greater diversity of substrate configurations, unwinds substrates containing an overhang with highest efficiency (29, 73).
Functional determinants for substrate specificity and translocation. To determine whether the helicase interacts with both strands of the duplex or whether one strand is of primary importance for translocation and unwinding, helicase activity has been studied on substrates of varied chemical composition. For example, the processive NPH-II helicase is highly specific for RNA (28), and experiments on helicase-substrate recognition took advantage of this feature to probe the regions of duplex substrate that are specifically recognized by the protein (38). Unwinding experiments were conducted on a series of chimeric DNA-RNA substrates that contained blocks of deoxynucleotides within the 3′-single-stranded region of the overhang, on the bottom strand (this is also called the loading strand), or on the top strand (this is the displaced strand). These studies revealed that NPH-II is tolerant of deoxyribose residues on the top strand and along most of the over
hang. Ribose residues are strictly required only in the bottom strand of the duplex and junction regions (38). These results suggested that NPH-II translocates along the sugarphosphate backbone of the bottom strand. Additional determinants for helicasesubstrate recognition were probed with chemically modified RNA substrates and through the assembly of multipiece substrates that contained nicks or simple covalent discontinuities (37). Unwinding experiments with both the NPH-II and NS3 helicases showed that neither helicase is inhibited by nicks in the top strand and that pieces of the top strand are sequentially displaced as the helicase translocates from 3′ to 5′ along the tracking strand (5, 37). Neither helicase can bypass a nick in the bottom strand, indicating that these proteins (and probably other SF2 proteins) require covalent continuity of the track. To further probe determinants for the track, unwinding experiments were conducted with substrates that contain polyglycol moieties on the top or bottom strand. Whereas polyglycol linkers in the top strand have no effect on helicase activity, their incorporation in the bottom strand abrogates unwinding. These results suggest that NPHII makes contact with either base or backbone residues to continuously translocate (37). To differentiate between base and backbone recognition by NPH-II, abasic residues were incorporated into both top and bottom strands. Abasic moieties preserve the normal sugar-phosphodiester linkage but lack a nucleobase. Strikingly, NPH-II tolerates large blocks of abasic ribonucleotides incorporated within the tracking strand (37). These experiments establish that NPH-II specifically recognizes sugar and phosphate moieties of the bottom strand and that nucleobases are not required for continuous translocation or duplex destabilization by the helicase. These findings are consistent with the wealth of crystal structures showing that processive SF2 helicases make direct contacts primarily with atoms in the phosphodiester backbone of RNA and DNA (13, 30, 40, 63). Backbone recognition is

a general feature of SF2 helicases (contrasting with mechanisms proposed for SF1 helicases), and protein-backbone contacts are sufficient for ensuring that SF2 helicases maintain a grip on the track. SF2 helicases tend to be strictly specific for RNA or DNA. However NS3 is unusual in that it readily unwinds both RNA and DNA substrates (54). Nonetheless, crystallographic investigations indicate that NS3 also tracks along the backbone, making contacts with phosphoryl oxygens (40). An unusual feature of NS3 tracking is that it can tolerate the polyglycol linkers in the bottom strand (5). Consistent with its large apparent step size for unwinding (60), NS3 appears to have a mechanism for maintaining contact with the track, even upon encounters with obstacles or deformations.

firmed through single-molecule experiments, which show that NS3 maintains physical contact with both displaced strands (52). The fact that NS3 can bypass polyglycols may be related to the suggestion that it senses ahead of the duplex junction (52) and that it may form contacts within the duplex region (16). This would be consistent with the fact that NS3 displays sensitivity to the conformation of adjacent duplex (68). These behaviors [and its tendency to function as a dimer (60)] may enable NS3 to span lesions in the track and move past them.
Structural features of the bound state. RNA and DNA strands tend to bind processive SF2 helicases in an extended configuration that aligns the backbone across the top of both RecA folds in the protein (usually designated Domains 1 and 2) (Figure 3, left) (30). The nucleotides within the strand maintain a stacked configuration and are not highly distorted by protein binding. Crystal structures of processive SF2 helicases in complex with substrates reveal that they form a similar pattern of molecular contacts with the tracking strand (30). These observations, together with results from single-molecule studies, have led to a unified physical model by which all processive SF2 proteins (including those involved in chromatin remodeling) couple ATP hydrolysis to translocation along the backbone of their tracks (30, 52). The above observations would seem to suggest that SF2 helicases such as NPHII and NS3 are simple wire strippers that travel directionally on the tracking strand and strip away the top strand without any regard to its chemical composition. This is consistent with single-molecule experiments showing that these proteins translocate from 3′ to 5′ along single-stranded RNA or DNA (52). This is also supported by the finding that NPH-II efficiently strips proteins from single-stranded RNA in a directional manner (22). However, the duplex character of the junction region may contribute to optimal binding of NPH-II and other

helicases, and this may facilitate unwinding (68). For example, functional binding studies on the NPH-II helicase showed that NPHII binds more strongly to RNA containing a single-stranded/double-stranded junction region than to single-stranded RNA (37). Similarly, direct binding studies showed that the NS3 helicase displays the highest affinity for DNA duplexes that contain a junction with a 3′ overhang (44). This work showed that NS3 invades the first few base pairs upon binding the substrate (consistent with crystal structures of other helicases) (13, 44), and that this partially unwound state plays an important role in the cycle of unwinding. Therefore, even if single-strand tracking is the operative mechanism for helicase translocation, the unwinding mechanism is likely to involve interactions with the duplex.
The basis for 3 ′ → 5 ′ directionality. Molecular explanations for the consistent 3′ → 5′ directionality of SF2 helicases have recently emerged from structural and biochemical investigations demonstrating that conserved domains of SF2 helicases consistently bind nucleic acid strands with a defined polarity: D1 interacts with the 3′ end and D2 interacts with the 5′ end of bound single strands, resulting in an interface with a well-defined asymmetry that is likely to differentiate the two possible strand orientations within the binding cleft (30). Proper strand orientation is likely enforced by additional protein motifs, such as the conserved “gatekeeper” tryptophan that projects from D3 of NS3 and caps the downstream terminus of the bound strand (Figure 2) (52). Furthermore, the betahairpin that projects from D2 of SF2 helicases NS3 and Hel308 reinforces the directional geometry and stimulates unwinding by wedging between the last single-stranded base and the first intact base pair of a bound duplex substrate (13). A complementary model is suggested by recent bioinformatic work on PcrA helicases, which indicates that directionality is controlled by amino acids in motifs III and VI (74).
Physical Mechanisms for Translocation and Unwinding
For the SF2 and SF1 classes of proteins, translocation and unwinding are distinct processes. Most helicases rapidly translocate along single-stranded nucleic acid, and they do not depend on duplex character for forward motion. However, the mechanism for strand separation is likely influenced by the physical processes involved in both physical translocation and encounters with the duplex. In recent years, several questions have dominated the field: Do helicases actively separate the strands of a duplex or do they take advantage of the rapid base pair opening that occurs spontaneously at duplex termini? What is the physical and structural basis for translocation and strand separation by helicases? What are the kinetic and dynamical processes that are involved in motion and unwinding? These problems have been investigated with a broad variety of techniques, which include structural biology, single-molecule investigations, and mechanistic enzymology. Each of these approaches brings a different perspective to the issues, but taken together, they are rapidly converging on coherent models for helicase mechanism.
Opportunism versus activism: differentiating passive from active unwinding. In an early effort to frame the basic issues involved in helicase mechanism, von Hippel and colleagues (25) and Amaratunga & Lohman (2) proposed two ways by which helicases might function, both of which assume that the protein translocates along a single loading strand in a biased (directional) manner. In the passive mechanism, the helicase behaves opportunistically: simply waiting at the junction for transient opening of the base pairs, which occurs rapidly and spontaneously at duplex termini. When the terminal base pairs open, the helicase advances forward along the tracking strand and physically blocks the base pair(s) from reforming. Although this mechanism is very simple, it is expected to be efficient

because the kinetics of local base pair opening are relatively fast (43, 53). However, the rate constants for basepair opening are generally slower than the rate constants for helicase translocation along single-strand RNA or DNA (7). It has therefore been proposed that the fastest helicases will not be purely opportunistic: They will have mechanisms for actively destabilizing the duplex in their paths, thereby stimulating the rate constant for unwinding (7, 16, 20, 36). The physical mechanism for activation is not yet defined for any system. The protein could spread out over the duplex region and electrostatically destabilize it, the protein may form destabilizing interactions with the bases, or it might exert force or torque on the duplex and pry it apart. Either way, the maximum speed of an active helicase is the velocity of translocation on single-stranded nucleic acid. Recent theoretical and experimental work has demonstrated that passive and active mechanisms are not contradictory models: They represent the two extremes of an energetic continuum (7, 16, 20). This was originally shown by the comprehensive physical framework for helicase behavior that was developed by Betterton and Ju ̈ licher (7). They showed that one can account for helicase behavior by defining a simple set of operative terms that include the forward and reverse rates of a helicase on single-stranded RNA (k+ and k−) and the rate constant for spontaneous opening and closing of base pairs at the duplex junction (β for closing, α for opening). Given that thermal activation causes the transient opening at duplex junctions, they demonstrate that α/β = e−G, where G is the energy of a single base pair. If one assumes that G = 2 [and it will vary from 0.9 to 3.3 depending on sequence (23)], then α/β = e−2 = 1/7. Given their derivation for the maximum rate constant (vmax) for a unidirectional helicase [vmax = k+(α/β)], if one assumes that k+ << β, strictly unidirectional translocation, and a G of 2, this formalism predicts that a strictly passive helicase will unwind seven
fold more slowly than it can translocate along single-stranded nucleic acid (7). The degree of helicase activeness (the extent to which it destabilizes the junction) is described by the magnitude and shape of a coupling potential, U, between the helicase and the junction (7). A purely passive helicase will be confronted by a hard-wall potential that is infinitely large. An active helicase can be described by a softer coupling potential that extends a specific distance into the duplex region. For example, an active helicase that destabilizes an extensive region of the duplex is described by a staircase potential that is spread over the spatial region that is thermodynamically influenced by interactions with the helicase (Figure 4). This formalism implies that the only difference between an active and a passive helicase is the magnitude and shape of the coupling potential, which can vary greatly among systems. An infinitely active helicase unwinds DNA or RNA as fast as it translocates along single strands, whereas an infinitely passive helicase is limited by the rate constant of duplex breathing. Using only a few mathematical terms, this model accounts for helicases with minimal interactions with the duplex and helicases with an extensive, destabilizing interface. In a notable extension of this theory, Betterton suggests that certain systems may have a negative staircase potential, whereby protein binding makes it harder to unwind an adjacent duplex (presumably because of interactions that stabilize duplexes). In these cases, unwinding will be slower than the rate constant for spontaneous duplex opening (7). Direct empirical evidence for an active helicase and for the existence of the energetic continuum between purely passive and active mechanisms has come from single-molecule force-extension experiments on the ring-shaped T7 helicase (36). This work is in excellent agreement with the formalisms introduced by Betterton & Ju ̈ licher (7), but it demonstrates that simple comparisons of single-strand translocation and duplex unwinding rates may be insufficient for

determining whether the mechanism is passive or active. In this work, the “degree of activeness” is revealed by the force and sequence dependence of the unwinding rate constants. It is also essential to account for the unwinding step size (the number of base pairs that come apart in a single rate-limiting step) and, as in the staircase potential described by the authors, the “interaction range,” or spatial extent to which the helicase interacts with the duplex (Figure 4). Wang and colleagues (36) suggest that the degree of activeness is ideally represented by a scale of free energy values (Gd) that ranges from 0 kBT (for a purely passive helicase) to 3.4 kBT (for an optimally active helicase that opens G-C pairs as fast as it translocates on single-stranded DNA). They observe that the T7 DNA helicase falls in the middle of this scale at 1–2 kBT (36). Similar conclusions have been reached through bulk and force-extension experiments on the NS3 helicase (16), although the degree of helicase activation is deduced in this case from the sequence dependence of velocity and processivity of the system (16, 20). While elements of a passive mechanism are apparent in the NS3 preference for unwinding A-U versus G-C pairs, the apparent unwinding velocity at G-C pairs is faster than that computed for a purely passive mechanism. Therefore, like the T7 DNA helicase, NS3 falls in the middle of the energetic continuum between passive and active mechanisms for unwinding. In a side-by-side comparison of T7 and NS3 helicases, interaction potentials were computed and found to be remarkably similar for both enzymes when operating on their natural substrates (Uo, or the degree of activation was ∼1 kcal per mol per base pair) (20). Unlike the unwinding rates for the T7 DNA helicase (36), unwinding rates for the SF1 and SF2 helicases UvrD and NS3 helicases are independent of applied force (19, 21), and therefore different physical events may limit the rate constant for strand separation in the case of the nonring helicase families. Despite these differences, most helicases combine aspects of the passive and active mecha

Processivity: the degree to which a protein moves continuously and directionally along a filament, rather than dissociating
nisms and they can be compared by considering their relative position along an activity scale (Figure 4) (36). The primary differences among helicase enzymes are likely their physical mechanisms for promoting duplex destabilization near the junction.
The physical basis for directional motion and unwinding. There has been considerable effort to define the physical processes by which SF2 helicases couple ATP hydrolysis with directional translocation during unwinding. Two different concepts for coupled translocation have recently emerged, and they are highly complementary.

the SF2 subclass that contains the amino acid sequence AspGlu-variable-His in conserved motif II
FRET: fluorescence resonance energy transfer
The Brownian motor. According to this model, helicases translocate directionally by undergoing alternating cycles of strong and weak binding to an inherently asymmetric nucleic acid substrate. Like other DExH proteins (69), NS3 binds tightly to nucleic acid in the absence of ATP and more weakly in the presence of ATP (44). Thus, ATP hydrolysis provides the necessary switch between strong and weakly bound states. In the ATPfree state, NS3 binds with highest affinity at single-stranded/double-stranded junctions, which biases motion in the forward direction and results in local melting of the duplex. Having invaded the duplex, the helicase would simply halt if it were not for subsequent ATP-binding events, which release the helicase from the lattice, permitting it another opportunity to bind the new junction upstream (44). This simple model is particularly useful because it makes no assumptions about the rigidity or flexibility of the helicase and focuses exclusively on the basic thermodynamic events that occur during the unwinding cycle. This model may also be applicable to the unwinding mechanism of the Upf1 RNA helicase, which is an SF1 protein that displays similar coupling between the binding of RNA and ATP (17).
The backbone stepping motor. This model arose from high-resolution structural studies of SF2 helicases in different ligand-bound states (13, 30) and from single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments on NS3 helicase (52). Because the model was originally formulated as a unified mechanism for explaining single-strand translocation by SF2 helicases, it can readily be applied to the related contexts of duplex unwinding, protein displacement, and chromatin remodeling. Several key observations gave rise to this structurally defined model for translocation. (a) The two RecA folds of SF1 and SF2 helicases can be visualized as a set of pincers, which are closed when ATP is bound and open when ATP is absent (Figure 5). (b) At the terminus of each pin
cer is a highly conserved threonine residue that makes direct contact to a phosphoryl oxygen on the tracking strand (Figures 2 and 5). (c) In the ATP-free state the distance between the pincers is three nucleotides, and in the ATP-bound state the distance between the pincers is two nucleotides (30). Given that the pincers move by an increment of one nucleotide during each cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release, it appears that SF2 helicases step along the backbone in singlenucleotide increments in a reaction that is directly coupled to ATP utilization. A similar stepping model has been proposed for the directional translocation of PcrA helicases (74). Because the helicase maintains contact with the nucleic acid in each state, the stepping model might seem to be at odds with the Brownian motor model (44), which predicts that the ATP-bound state has little affinity for the lattice. Indeed, studies on the ATP dependence of RNA unwinding by the fulllength NS3 protein indicate that both ATPbound and ATP-free states have reasonably high affinity for the RNA lattice. However, RNA interactions by the ATP-bound form of NS3 are approximately 10-fold weaker (44). This weak state may promote local rearrangements and facilitate translocation as predicted by the Brownian motor model. Thus, the threonine stepping model and the Brownian motor model are two complementary ways to describe translocation by NS3 on RNA. Single-molecule studies on NS3 have provided functional evidence for singlenucleotide translocation steps, which are linked to larger motions that occur during duplex unwinding (52). Single-molecule FRET experiments reveal that NS3 unwinding of DNA takes place in highly regular steps of three base pairs (Figure 5) (52). This finding is consistent with single-molecule forceextension experiments showing that the basic unit for RNA unwinding by NS3 is a threebase-pair step (21). Although strand separation occurs in bursts of three base pairs, dwell-time analysis indicates that each burst

it is poised to open the RNA in three-base-pair increments, as does a plowshare (52). Taken together, the single-molecule and crystallographic information were combined to formulate a hypothetical mechanism for NS3 unwinding: As D1 and D2 translocate along the tracking strand, tension builds between the motor domain and the tryptophan

DEAD proteins: the nonprocessive SF2 subclass that contains the amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp in conserved motif II
in D3 that remains stacked at the junction. After D1 and D2 have tracked forward by three base pairs, the protein contracts like a spring, pulling D3 toward the motor domains and thereby opening the intervening duplex (52) (Figure 5). This spring-like mechanism suggests the importance of molecular elasticity in helicase function and it differs from purely thermodynamic formalisms that necessarily treat the helicase as a rigid body.
Diverse kinetic and dynamical processes involved in unwinding cycles. The past decade of analysis on SF2 helicases has resulted in a puzzling diversity of dynamic events that depend on the method of analysis and the timescale of the experiment. Debates about the magnitude and the physical meaning of the helicase step size have dominated scientific meetings and the literature. Clarity on this issue is developing, however, as additional data are gleaned from single-molecule studies and structural studies of helicases in various ligand-bound states. These studies are showing that helicases display a diversity of mechanical behaviors and each of these has an important role to play in the overall cycle of unwinding by SF2 proteins. For example, the first kinetic framework for RNA helicase activity revealed that NPHII unwinds RNA with a kinetic step size of six base pairs (34). Like the SF1 helicases UvrD and Rep, which were studied using methods developed originally by Lohman and colleagues (49), the repetitive rate-limiting event represented a step size greater than the single base steps predicted from crystal structures of helicase proteins (30, 42). The existence of large kinetic steps was strikingly exemplified by high-resolution unwinding experiments on the NS3 dimer, which displays a bulk kinetic step size of 18 base pairs (60). In the case of NS3, intensive investigation using a diversity of bulk and single-molecule techniques has assigned a function to all of the various steps that have been reported. As described in the previous section, NS3 is likely to translocate along the phosphate back
bone in single-nucleotide steps (52), each of which may be coupled to the utilization of one ATP molecule. However, the duplex is opened in three-base-pair increments, through the spring action of multiple NS3 domains (Figure 5) (21, 52). The very large steps observed for NS3 are unlikely to reflect duplex unwinding events (21, 45, 60). Rather, they appear to represent a third, and previously unrecognized, feature of helicase mechanism: the controlled binding and release of unwound product strands. NS3 maintains strong physical contact with the top strand after unwinding (52), probably sequestering it along the positively charged path that lies across the surface of D2 and the protease domain (6). By maintaining contact with unwound products and holding them away from each other, NS3 prevents rapid reannealing and is likely to reduce the backpressure that results if unwound products are not physically trapped. Large step sizes are observed in experiments in which the appearance of unwound products is rate limiting (rather than unwinding, per se) (21, 45, 60). This suggests that product is not released continuously, but in pulses that occur after the bound RNA has reached a certain persistence length (14 to 18 base pairs under conditions of no force and 9 to 11 base pairs under conditions of high force). As in many other enzymes, the control of product release is a kinetically distinct feature that plays an important role in overall reaction efficiency.
THE NONPROCESSIVE DEAD CLASS OF RNA HELICASES: STRUCTURE AND MECHANISM
The SF2 family members that contain a DEAD sequence in motif II (DEAD proteins) are the largest and most metabolically important group of RNA helicase enzymes (33). The DEAD proteins behave differently when compared with other SF2 and SF1 helicases. They are structurally distinct and use different strategies to bind and couple their substrates to ATP hydrolysis. DEAD proteins have separate cellular tasks compared with processive
328 Pyle


helicases: Most DEAD proteins have evolved to unwind short RNA duplexes or to act as ATP-regulated conformational switches.
Structures and Substrate Recognition by DEAD Proteins
In all SF1 and SF2 proteins, ATP binding and hydrolysis takes place at the interface of two RecA domains (Figure 2). For processive helicases, the RecA domains are held tightly in place through interactions with additional domains that rigidify the interface (Figure 3). As a result, DExH proteins such as NS3 tend to display high levels of ATPase activity even when RNA is not bound. By contrast, DEAD proteins are more floppy. The two RecA domains are connected by a flexible linker that prevents ATP hydrolysis until the protein rigidifies their interface through the binding of RNA and/or other proteins (Figure 3). As a result, specific RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis are tightly coupled, resulting in protein function that is highly amenable to regulation by cellular cofactors (33). While the active site for ATP hydrolysis looks similar to that of other helicases, the conformation of bound RNA is significantly different. In contrast to DExH proteins, crystal structures of DEAD proteins indicate that they distort the bound RNA, tightly kinking the bound strand in a manner that would prevent formation of an A-form duplex (10, 59). Whereas the clean threading of RNA through DExH proteins may facilitate processive unwinding (13, 40), the kinking of RNA in DEAD proteins appears to preclude processive behavior: DEAD proteins may be required to release the bound strand and completely dissociate from the original site to bind at a new location. Most DEAD-box helicases display clear specificity for RNA, provided it is present in at least one of the bound strands. In certain cases, the binding of a specific RNA target is required for ATPase and unwinding activities. An example of this is DbpA, which recognizes
a region of ribosomal RNA (55). Other helicases are activated by the binding of protein cofactors or small ligands (61). In the case of Dbp5, activity of the protein-cofactor complex is allosterically controlled through the binding of a small molecule: inositol hexakisphosphate (1, 70). Other members of the DEAD family display a low level of substrate specificity and are capable of unwinding weak duplexes irrespective of context or sequence. The unwinding of blunt duplexes tends to be less efficient (64, 73), however, and the presence of singlestranded RNA stimulates helicase activity in both model substrates and in larger RNA tertiary structures (64, 73). In contrast to the DExH group, however, which requires that the single strand be immediately adjacent to the duplex, DEAD proteins only require single strands in proximity to the duplex: Separation by many angstroms is tolerated. Rather than acting as a launch pad for processive unwinding, the single-stranded RNA in DEAD proteins acts as bait for increasing local concentration of protein near the duplex target site (73).
RNA-Binding Proteins with a Twist: Unwinding Mechanism of DEAD Proteins
Because they are not processive helicases, DEAD proteins must somehow couple local binding to unwinding. Fundamentally, DEAD proteins are RNA-binding proteins that undergo conformational changes resulting from ATP binding, hydrolysis, or product release. Structural and biochemical approaches are beginning to provide information on the linkage between ATP binding and the affinity for RNA substrates (duplex) versus products (single strand). For example, it is evident that the ATP-regulated cycle of RNA binding and release is opposite that of DExH proteins: For DEAD proteins, RNA binding is strong in the presence of ATP and weak in its absence or in the presence of ADP (48, 72, 73). Thus, the power stroke and

conformational state that results in unwinding may differ between the two systems. One model for explaining RNA unwinding by a DEAD protein is that, in the process of ATP binding and hydrolysis, it visits a transient conformational state that is destabilizing to duplex RNA but stabilizing to singlestranded RNA (i.e., product), as suggested for the protein Ded1 (33). However, the precise link between the strong product-bound state and a specific form of the nucleotide has not yet been uncovered. There are at least two ways to envision how unwinding actually occurs once the protein adopts the substratedestabilizing conformer. In a specific stage of ATP hydrolysis or nucleotide product release, the protein may form a destabilizing electrostatic interface with the duplex or adopt molecular contacts that induce local melting. A more active mechanism is indicated by the crystal structures of RNA-bound complexes, such as Vasa (59), which suggest that the protein may exert force or torque on the duplex and actively wrench it apart. The Vasa protein kinks single-stranded RNA in a conformation that would not accommodate duplex character. Thus, the transition between a duplex bound and single-strand bound of the protein might be expected to shear the duplex (59). Alternatively, Vasa may simply trap a transient, single-strand form of the substrate and bind it in a manner that inhibits duplex formation, thereby driving the overall reaction toward the unwound state.
WHEN A HELICASE IS NOT A HELICASE: THE DIVERSE FUNCTIONS OF DExH/D PROTEINS
Although DEAD and DExH proteins bear the typical set of helicase motifs as originally designated in 1993, only a subset of these proteins display demonstrable RNA unwinding activity (18). While this lack of activity can often be attributed to a requirement for unidentified cellular RNA factors, it is now clear that many
DEAD proteins do not unwind RNA because that is not their function. At this critical time of genome annotation, it is vital to emphasize that DEAD-box proteins can have many occupations in the cell (18, 47), which in addition to helicase activity include RNA or RNP stabilization (56, 72), protein displacement (32), and even transcriptional regulation (24). Analysis of DEAD protein function has only just begun, and it is therefore inevitable that novel functions will continue to be ascribed to this exceptionally large enzyme family. It is likely that DEAD proteins will ultimately be considered similar to G proteins, using diverse molecular mechanisms to regulate various aspects of cellular metabolism.
RNA Anchoring
The most extreme case of nonhelicase behavior by a DExH/D protein is that of the protein eIF4AIII, which stabilizes and anchors a large protein complex at the junction between spliced exons (the exon junction complex, or EJC), thereby facilitating proper export and processing of mRNA molecules. Crystal structures of the EJC reveal that eIF4AIII interacts with RNA in a manner similar to that of Vasa, binding in a kinked orientation that would facilitate tight protein binding and readout of the target site (3, 10).
Strand Annealing
Many DEAD proteins have a strong strandannealing activity (15, 71, 72), particularly if they contain a basic C-terminal domain that can function as a secondary RNA-binding site (such as the yeast proteins Ded1 and Mss116 and the Neurospora protein Cyt-19) (29, 64). Annealing activity has been intensively studied for Ded1, which readily stabilizes duplexes in the absence of ATP and reaches an equilibrium between annealing and unwinding in the presence of ATP (71, 72). The ability to alternately stabilize and destabilize structures in different ATP-bound states suggests that DEAD proteins may be vital for catalyzing
330 Pyle


the structural transitions involved in assembly and disassembly of RNA structures and RNP complexes (15).
RNA Tertiary Folding
A diversity of DEAD proteins is required for ribosome assembly (9) and the folding of large, tertiary folded RNAs such as selfsplicing group II introns (29, 51). Although many of these proteins promote RNA folding by unwinding misfolded, kinetically trapped substructures (i.e., functioning as a type of chaperone) (8), this is unlikely to be their only mode of action. For example, the yeast group II intron ai5γ requires the DEAD protein Mss116 for self-splicing in vivo (31) and under near-physiological conditions in vitro (29, 64). The rate-limiting step for ai5γ core assembly is the early formation of an unstable intermediate, and it has been proposed that Mss116 drives folding by binding and stabilizing this on-pathway intermediate and/or the native state (56). However, the formation of many large RNA tertiary structures likely requires the dual action of DEAD proteins that operate alternately as weak helicases and strong stabilizers, thereby pushing and pulling large RNA molecules into the native state.
Protein Displacement
Given the ubiquity of DExH/D proteins within conformationally dynamic RNP assemblies such as the spliceosome, it was long postulated that DExH/D proteins might displace proteins from RNA in an ATP-dependent manner (65). Model studies were therefore undertaken to assess whether DExH/D proteins can strip proteins from RNA (RNPase activity) (35). RNP-binding sites were incorporated into substrates for the NPH-II helicase, which was observed to efficiently displace diverse proteins from duplex or single-stranded RNA (22, 32, 35). RNPase activity by NPH-II was not entirely surprising given that it is a DExH protein that processively translocates along single-stranded RNA
RNPase: an enzyme that displaces proteins from RNA
(34). However, it was highly significant that RNPase activity was also demonstrated for the DEAD protein Ded1 (12, 73), which catalyzes RNPase activity through a mechanism distinct from NPH-II. This work established that both classes of RNA helicase (processive and nonprocessive) can function as RNPases. RNPase activity by DExH/D proteins is critical for most aspects of RNA metabolism in diverse biophysical contexts (32). For example, the DEAD protein Dbp5 is anchored at the nuclear pore, where it appears to strip export protein Mex67 from mature RNA that is being transported into the cytoplasm (67).
THE CRITICAL ROLE OF PARTNER PROTEINS
Most DExH/D proteins do not function in isolation. They are usually part of larger macromolecular machines in which partner proteins stimulate mechanical activities, specify reaction substrates, and transduce ATP-dependent conformational changes (9, 61). In the cases of NS3 and DbpA, covalently appended domains act as helicase cofactors, thereby demonstrating that partner proteins can be provided in cis or in trans (6). The flexible DEAD-box proteins typically require partner proteins for stimulating significant levels of ATPase activity, an effect that is probably due to structural rigidification (33). For example, efficient ATPase activity by eIF4A depends on interactions with eIF4B and eIF4G (9, 58, 61). Similar stimulation of ATPase activity is seen upon binding of the ESF2 cofactor to Dbp8, which is required for ribosome biogenesis (27). The RNPase Dbp5 requires interactions with the allosterically regulated Gle1 protein before it can function in the nuclear pore complex (67). Processive DExH proteins can also be positively regulated through interactions with cofactors, as shown by studies of the NS3 helicase from hepatitis C virus. In that case, the

NS3 protease domain acts as a stimulatory internal cofactor (6). In addition, the NS4A protein forms a network of interactions with NS3 (46), thereby anchoring it on the ER membrane and stimulating productive interactions with RNA (54). The case of NS3 also illustrates that SF2 RNA helicases can be partners to each other: As in a locomotive, two motors can be better than one. The monomeric form of NS3 has weak helicase activity and can only unwind short duplexes in the absence of additional force on the duplex substrate (21). Processive NS3 unwinding activity is stimulated by the formation of a functional dimer (60), which raises the interesting
and unexplored issue of potential coupling between RNA helicase motors. Partner proteins do not always stimulate mechanical activities of DExH/D proteins: They can also clamp the protein into a single conformation (a form of negative regulation). For example, eIF4AIII has been transformed into a rigid, high-affinity RNA-binding protein through interactions with proteins of the EJC (3, 10). By enforcing a conformation that promotes strong RNA binding in the ATPbound state, and by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis, the partner proteins lock eIF4AIII into a conformation that anchors the EJC at sites of exon ligation.
SUMMARY POINTS
1. RNA helicases share a structural organization involving two RecA fold domains that comprise a common active site for ATP binding. Many helicases require RNA binding or the association of protein cofactors to stimulate ATP hydrolysis.
2. Although designated helicases, RNA-remodeling proteins display diverse functions that can also include the stabilization of RNA structures and protein displacement.
3. There are two major classes of RNA helicase enzymes: the processive DExH class and the nonprocessive DEAD class. They bind RNA differently and utilize different mechanisms for catalyzing strand displacement.
4. The processive DExH class of RNA helicases, similar to SF2 DNA helicases, has an unwinding mechanism that is coupled to single-strand translocation. The physical mechanism for unwinding involves both passive and active characteristics.
5. Processive RNA helicases display a diversity of mechanical step sizes during unwinding, all of which are important for the mechanism of efficient strand displacement.
FUTURE ISSUES
1. What is the actual physical mechanism of strand separation by RNA helicases? Do they cause local melting or do they weaken the duplex by force?
2. How do RNA helicases link ATP-dependent conformational changes to translocation and local duplex rearrangements?
3. How do helicases inhibit strand reannealing and thereby facilitate forward motion?
4. How do partner proteins enhance unwinding efficiency and processivity on RNA?
