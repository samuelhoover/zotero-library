ABSTRACT: The multiscale organizational structure of chromatin in eukaryotic cells is instrumental to DNA transcription, replication, and repair. At mesoscopic length scales, nucleosomes pack in a manner that serves to regulate gene expression through condensation and expansion of the genome. The particular structures that arise and their respective thermodynamic stabilities, however, have yet to be fully resolved. In this study, we combine molecular modeling using the 1CPN mesoscale model of chromatin with nonlinear manifold learning to identify and characterize the structure and free energy of metastable states of short chromatin segments comprising between 4- and 16-nucleosomes. Our results reveal the formation of two previously characterized tetranucleosomal conformations, the “αtetrahedron” and the “β-rhombus”, which have been suggested to play an important role in the accessibility of DNA and, respectively, induce local chromatin compaction or elongation. The spontaneous formation of these motifs is potentially responsible for the slow nucleosome dynamics observed in experimental studies. Increases of the nucleosome repeat length are accompanied by more pronounced structural irregularity and flexibility and, ultimately, a dynamic liquid-like behavior that allows for frequent structural reorganization. Our findings indicate that tetranucleosome motifs are intrinsically stable structural states, driven by local internucleosomal interactions, and support a mechanistic picture of chromatin packing, dynamics, and accessibility that is strongly influenced by emergent local mesoscale structure.

INTRODUCTION
Chromatin is the complex of DNA, RNA, and proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei. Chromatin’s dynamic, multiscale structure is central to the regulation of transcription,
replication, and DNA repair.1,2 The basic building block of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome, a disk-like DNA− protein complex of approximately 146 basepairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around a protein complex known as the histone
octomer.2 These small and positively charged proteins bind strongly to the negatively charged DNA. Each nucleosome contains four core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4)
that are found in equal proportions in cells.3 Nucleosomes connect to adjacent nucleosomes through a segment of linker DNA whose combined length with core DNA is referred to as a nucleosome repeat length (NRL). Nucleosome repeat lengths exhibit a distribution centered around 180 bp,
depending on organism, cell type, or loci in a given cell type.1 It has long been argued that nucleosomes condense into a 30 nm thick chromatin fiber that progressively folds to form
mitotic chromosomes and interphase nuclei.4 The character and properties of higher-order chromatin structures in vivo also
continue to be the source of debate.4 Experimental techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy, chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and super-resolution STORM (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) indicate that chromatin in living cells is predominantly comprised of highly irregular
structures.5−10 The emerging view that chromatin organization
is dominated by intermediate scale assemblies (∼3−10nucleosomes) is supported by results from various chromosome conformation capture techniques and electron cryotomography, which have revealed the existence of clusters comprising only a few nucleosomes that may play a role in
chromatin biology.6,11−13 Tetranucleosomes are proposed to be functional and
structural units that regulate gene expression.6,13,14 They have been crystallizable at NRLs of 157 and 167 bp and observed in longer chromatin fibers of 12 tandem repeats of
177 and 187 bp from cryo-EM.15,16 Cryo-EM experimental evidence of nucleosome stacking, with two-start tetranucleosomes stacked on top of each other, has also been reported in
human cell lines.17 Two tetranucleosome motifs have recently been proposed to serve regulatory functions: the α-tetrahedron
and the β-rhombus.13 The all-atom structure of the αtetrahedron and β-rhombus motifs are shown in Figure 1A,B,
respectively.15,18 In Figure 1C,D, we provide a representation of these two motifs that relies on the 1CPN model. By combining nucleosome-resolved Hi-C measurements with simulated annealing−molecular dynamics (SA-MD), the

orientation of nucleosome pairs were analyzed by focusing on which nucleosome ends were ligated to one another in yeast
genome.13 Given their location near regulatory regions, within genes (α-tetrahedron) and at gene ends (β-rhombus), these specific folding motifs may serve a regulatory function and seem consistent with what is already established about chromatin organization, such as nucleosomal “clutches” and
“topologically associated domains” (TADs).13 It is unclear, however, whether these motifs arise due to an orchestrated set of interactions governed by protein partners or if they are intrinsically stable structural states of the nucleosome. Chemical fixation with compounds such as glutaraldehyde and methanol, which are employed in EM and super-resolution light microscopy, have benefited the study of chromatin but introduce the formation of artificial structures not present
under biological conditions.19 The adherence of free molecules, facilitated by the increase in hydrophobic interactions, forms long and continuous artificial structures which have become an issue in newer imaging experiments
such as STORM.19 Furthermore, long imaging times may mask important short-time nucleosome dynamics and mischarac
terize small nucleosome domains.19 Resolving the emergent structure and stability of tetranucleosome motifs as a function of NRL is of critical biological interest in understanding chromatin packing, DNA accessibility, and epigenetics. In this work we relied on large-scale simulations of various chromatin fiber lengths using the recently developed 1CPN
mesoscale model of chromatin (1-cylinder-per-nucleosome).20 This model is structured around a rigorous multiscale approach where free energies are derived from an established and extensively validated model of the nucleosome and
mapped onto a single anisotropic topology.21,22 The 1CPN model has accurately reproduced a range of chromatin properties, including nucleosome−nucleosome free energy interactions, nucleosome unwrapping free energies, and
sedimentation coefficients of short chromatin fibers,20 and its computational efficiency enables access to length and time scales not currently possible with atomistic models. To investigate the organizational properties of chromatin, we used nonlinear manifold learning, and identified the metastable states and collective motions that mediate transitions between such states (see Diffusion Maps in Materials and Methods). We investigated the formation of two previously characterized tetranucleosomal conformations (α-tetrahedron and β-rhombus motifs) that play an important role in the accessibility of DNA. Our results show that the relative thermodynamic stability of these two motifs are intrinsic properties of the chromatin chain independent of external cellular factors. Our findings and trends with NRL are consistent with experimental observations and provide new mechanistic insight into mesoscale structure formation and the hierarchical structure and conformational transitions of
chromatin.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We present the results of 1CPN simulations of three representative chromatin fibers with NRL values of 157, 187, and 197. These repeat lengths were selected due to their structures being available from X-ray and cyro-EM, thereby
allowing direct comparisons to experiment.14,15,23 For each NRL system we considered chromatic fibers containing 4-, 8-, and 16-nucleosomes and identified the metastable states and oligonucleosome organization using diffusion map dimensionality reduction. Simulations were conducted from an initial elongated conformation; convergence was considered achieved when the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) with respect to the initial frame approached a steady state (see Simulating the Chromatin Fiber in Material and Methods.) Where possible, we make contact with experimental measurements. NRL 157. Diffusion maps are a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that extracts collective variables (CVs) characterizing the large-scale collective motions of molecular
systems.24 These CVs are computed as the eigenvectors of a particular transition matrix characterizing the similarity of various system configurations. The appropriate number of eigenvectors to retain in the low-dimensional diffusion map embeddings can be determined by identifying a gap in the eigenvalue spectrum of the transition matrix that demarcate the leading modes characterizing the important large-scale collective motions from those associated with smaller amplitude conformational changes. Often the spectrum may exhibit multiple gaps corresponding to a hierarchical splitting into groups of collective modes ordered by decreasing amplitude. In all systems studied in this work we observe the leading spectral gap to occur after the first nontrivial eigenvalue (Supporting Information Figure S1). This suggests that the conformational dynamics of the system are dominated by a single CV, and we invariably correlate the leading eigenvector with global contraction or expansion of the fiber. In many cases, we also find the second eigenvector to also be informative and we can often correlate it with some additional aspect of the fiber conformational motions as discussed below. Many of the eigenvalue spectra exhibit additional spectral gaps indicative of a hierarchical partitioning of CVs, but our

exploration of the higher-order eigenvectors did not show any obvious correlation with putative physical order parameters or expose any additional interpretability beyond what we were able to extract from the 2D embeddings. For this reason, in addition to visual clarity and accessibility, all embeddings in this work are 2D in nature. In Figure 2A−C we present 2D embeddings of the 95,000 simulation snapshots of the chromatin fibers with NRL 157 into the two leading diffusion map CVs (ψ1,ψ2). To provide some physical interpretability of the diffusion map embeddings, we computed the RMSD of each contiguous stretch of 4-nucleosomes relative to a prototypical α-/β-structure motif by passing a 4-nucleosome sliding window along the fiber. Dividing by the number of windows defines an order parameter by which to measure the propensity of the complete fiber for either motif. In the 4- and 8-nucleosome fibers, a Pearson correlation analysis reveals the α-/β-structure preference to be strongly correlated with the leading diffusion map CV (ρα,ψ1
(4) = −0.75, ρβ,ψ1
(4) = 0.87; ρα,ψ1
(8) = 0.68, ρβ,ψ1
(8) =
−0.72). For the 16-nucleosome fiber, the leading CV is strongly correlated with the radius of gyration, Rg (ρRg,ψ1
(16) =
−0.74). The strong correlation with radius of gyration indicates that the leading CV extracted by diffusion maps is strongly associated with the compaction and expansion of the 16-nucleosome fiber. Inspection of the molecular configurations of the elongated and compact fibers in Figure 2C reveals that the elongated fiber contains a high degree of β motif character whereas the compact fiber is composed of primarily α motifs. For the systems studied in this work, it is a
general trend that the leading CVs identified by diffusion maps tend to correspond to local α/β motif character for shorter NRL values and fewer nucleosomes versus more global descriptors such as the fiber radius of gyration or end-to-end distance for longer NRL values and more nucleosomes. This transition can be understood as a result of the increased length and flexibility of the fiber, leading to the emergence of more global collective variables that subsume and contain the local packing effects. To resolve the metastable states of the system, in Figure 2D−F we present the corresponding free energy surfaces (FESs) in the Gibbs free energy, G(Ψ), constructed over the 2D intrinsic manifolds and decorated with representative molecular renderings. In the 4-nucleosome system (Figure 2D), a global free energy minimum is observed at (ψ1 ≈ −1.8,
ψ2 ≈ −0.7), and a metastable minimum is found at (ψ1 ≈ 1.3,
ψ2 ≈ −1.5) lying ∼2.21 kcal/mol higher in free energy. Visualization of the simulation snapshots contained within the local minima of the free energy landscape confirms the results of the Pearson correlation analysis that ψ1 should separate
configurations on the basis of α/β character, with the global minimum at low-ψ1 containing β-rhombus-like structures of
the 4-nucleosomes and the local minimum at high-ψ1
containing compact α-tetrahedron-like packings. These two motifs were previously reported in several chromosome conformation capture experiments, which have provided evidence for the existence of tri- and tetranucleosome folding
motifs as the primary level of organization in yeast genome.6,13 As mentioned earlier, oligonucleosome motifs may serve an important role as functional elements for processes such as
Figure 2. Two tetranucleosome motifs, the α-tetrahedron and the β-rhombus, respectively induce local chromatin compaction or the formation of elongated aggregates at short nucleosome repeat lengths of 157. (A, D) In 4-nucleosome fibers we observe a global free energy minimum at (ψ1 ≈
−1.8; ψ2 ≈ −0.7) and a metastable minimum at (ψ1 ≈ 1.3; ψ2 ≈ −1.5) that lies ∼2.21 kcal/mol higher in free energy. The global minimum
contains β-rhombus-like structures, while the local minimum contains compact α-tetrahedron-like packings. (B, E) The 8-nucleosome fiber possesses two metastable states with a large basin containing the global free energy minimum residing at (ψ1 ≈ 0.2; ψ2 ≈ −0.8) and a weak local
minimum at (ψ1 ≈ −1.5; ψ2 ≈ 2.8). The more compact structures reside in the local minimum and contain predominantly α-tetrahedron-like
packings, whereas the more extended in the global free energy minimum are β-rhombus-like. (C, F) The 16-nucleosome fiber possesses a global minimum at (ψ1 ≈ −0.99; ψ2 ≈ −0.23) containing the β-rhombus-like fiber that is ∼0.83 kcal/mol more stable than the local minimum at (ψ1 ≈
2.44; ψ2 ≈ −0.01) containing the α-tetrahedron-like fiber.

transcription, replication, and DNA repair.12 In addition, the rearrangement of tetranucleosomes from open/closed states may serve as a potential target for cellular regulation. For example, previous studies have shown many chromatin regulators have a preference to bind to multinucleosome
structures in vitro.25 We emphasize that our simulations were conducted from an initial elongated conformation, and we have verified that our sampling of the conformational ensemble is converged with the fiber making multiple transitions over the intrinsic manifold and between the two basins. As such, these structures represent inherent metastable states of the 4nucleosome NRL 157 system. In the larger 8-nucleosome system we again observe two metastable states with a large basin for the global free energy minimum at (ψ1 ≈ 0.2, ψ2 ≈ −0.8), and a weak local minimum
at (ψ1 ≈ −1.5, ψ2 ≈ 2.8) lying ∼2.51 kcal/mol higher in free
energy (Figure 2E). As for the 4-nucleosome fiber, the global minimum consists of more extended β-rhombus-like arrangements and the local minimum and contain more compact αtetrahedron-like packings. This analysis reveals that the prototypical α-tetrahedron and β-rhombus tetranucleosome motifs are preserved within the longer 8-nucleosome fiber. The 16-nucleosome fiber exhibits a similar trend, with a global minimum at (ψ1 ≈ −0.99, ψ2 ≈ −0.23) consisting of a
β-rhombus-like fiber that is ∼0.83 kcal/mol more stable than the local minimum at (ψ1 ≈ 2.44, ψ2 ≈ −0.01) that includes
the α-tetrahedron-like fiber (Figure 2F). As was the case for the 4- and 8-nucleosome fibers, the 16-nucleosome βrhombus-like fiber is less compact, more elongated, and more stable than the α-tetrahedron-like fiber. This is due to the
condensation and ordered linear packing of the β-rhombus subunits compared to the relatively poorly packed and disordered chain of α-tetrahedron motifs. Our results confirm the existence of two tetranucleosome motifs, α-tetrahedron and β-rhombus, that induce local chromatin compaction or form elongated aggregates at short nucleosome repeat lengths of 157, respectively. These computational findings are consistent with experimental Hi-C studies that have shown α-tetrahedron motifs to contribute to local chromatin compaction.13 Tetranucleosomes that take on an α-tetrahedron conformation introduce kinks and bring disorder into the fiber. β-Rhombus conformations, on the other hand, form an open-ladder-like chromatin structure that packs to form linear elongated aggregates. Our simulations of longer chromatin fibers at an NRL of 157 in the absence of H1, a linker histone protein considered important in maintaining higher-order chromatin structure, adopted a zigzag conformation in agreement with experiments from reconstituted arrays of nucleosomes without H1.16,26 The crystallization of 157 NRL fibers may be due to the stabilizing interactions between neighboring nucleosomes which intrinsically form these tetranucleosome motifs.16 NRL 187. In Figure 3A−C we present the 2D embeddings into the two leading diffusion map CVs for chromatin fiber with NRL 187. For a 4-nucleosome fiber, the leading diffusion CV is strongly correlated with α-structural preference (ρα,ψ1
(4) =
0.95) and the second leading CV correlated with β-preference
(ρβ,ψ2
(4) = 0.97). For an 8-nucleosome fiber, β-preference highly
correlated with the leading diffusion CV (ρβ,ψ1
(8) = 0.91). For the

(A, D) In 4-nucleosome fibers, we observe two β-rhombus clusters corresponding to the two distinct ways in which nucleosomes can arrange themselves to form the motif.

fiber comprised of 16-nucleosomes, the second CV is moderately correlated with the end-to-end distance of the fiber Rend (ρRend, ψ(216) = 0.56). In Figure 3D−F we present the
corresponding FESs and their representative molecular renderings derived from simulation. In contrast to the 4-nucleosome system with 157 NRL (Figure 2D), the 187 NRL system exhibits two distinct βrhombus wells in the free energy landscape for the 187 NRL (Figure 3D). This is a consequence of the increased degree of freedom permitted by the longer NRL chain that opens up the availability of additional metastable structures. Specifically, the two wells correspond to two distinct alternative packings of the 4-nucleosomes into the β-rhombus motif. The global minimum at (ψ1 ≈ 1.0, ψ2 ≈ 0.5) corresponds to a β-rhombus where the N- and (N + 1)-nucleosomes lie diagonally from each other. The local minimum located at (ψ1 ≈ −0.82, ψ2 ≈
−1.62) contains a second β-rhombus conformation where the N- and (N + 1)-nucleosomes lie directly across from one another and exists ∼3.55 kcal/mol higher in free energy. The local minimum at (ψ1 ≈ 1.3, ψ2 ≈ −1.5) contains the compact
α-tetrahedron motif and lies ∼1.75 kcal/mol higher in free energy. The gap between clusters suggests limited sampling in the interstitial region between the metastable α-/β-states. Comparing our results to simulations of NRLs of 157 (Figure 2D−F), the transition region is destabilized relative to the metastable states for longer NRL fibers, reflecting their larger degree of freedom to stably pack the nucleosomes into the α/β motifs. The 8- and 16-nucleosome fibers exhibit a relatively broad free energy landscape comprising metastable α/β motifs (Figure 3E,F and Figures S2 and S3). As in the case for
chromatin fibers of NRL 157, α-tetrahedron motifs contribute to local chromatin compaction while β-rhombus structures resemble ladder-like chromatin structure. The presence of several β-rhombus structures is consistent with the idea of a trior tetranucleosome motif in chromatin fiber folding proposed from Micro-C experiments where the decay of nucleosome− nucleosome interactions as a function of distance revealed no evidence for long-range periodicity in internucleosomal
interactions but of short-range structures.6 In addition, the results of our unbiased simulations where the only driver of the dynamics is thermal fluctuations, suggest that local chromatin motion is spontaneous, as observed from single-particle
tracking experiments.27 The observed local motion of chromatin at longer NRLs are characteristic of fluid-like behavior, suggesting a more irregular and dynamic view of chromatin. Interestingly, variability in motion seems to be a product of the constraints imposed by physical or geometrical factors. Experimental single-nucleosome tracking data in living human cells have suggested a nucleosome’s motion depend
ence on nucleosome−nucleosome interactions.28 The fiber makes multiple transitions over the intrinsic manifold and between the two metastable states. As such, these nucleosomes engage in short-lived stacking interactions, relative to total simulation time, that form distinct tetranucleosome motifs which we propose may be responsible for slowing chromatin dynamics through transient trapping in metastable states. NRL 197. We present in Figure 4A−C the 2D embeddings into the two leading diffusion map CVs for chromatin fibers of NRL 197. For the 4-nucleosome fiber, the end-to-end distance Rend is strongly correlated with the leading diffusion CV (ρRend,ψ1
(4)
= 0.88). In the case of 8- and 16-nucleosomes, each leading

An increase in fiber length is accompanied by an increase in structural irregularity and flexibility. (A, D) In 4-nucleosome fibers, the increase in nucleosome repeat length allows for more complex nucleosome arrangements of α-/β-structures. The leading diffusion map CV is strongly correlated with end-to-end distance of the fiber Rend (ρRend,ψ1
(4) = 0.88). (B, E) In 8-nucleosome fibers, the α-tetrahedron motifs contribute to local chromatin compaction while β-rhombus structures resemble the more ladder-like chromatin structure. The second CV is moderately correlated with the end-to-end distance
(ρRend,ψ2

nucleosome case, the second CV is moderately correlated with end-to-end distance (ρRend,ψ2
(16) = 0.69).

CVs lacked simple physical interpretation but the second CV correlated moderately with end-to-end distance (ρRend,ψ2
(8) = 0.42,
ρRend,ψ2
(16) = 0.69). We observed that for longer NRLs, fibers are
highly irregular and flexible, resembling a “sea of nucleosomes”
model.5,8 In this view, nucleosomes are able to interact with local and distant partners, leading to a more dynamic, liquidlike behavior that supports structural plasticity and frequent reorganization. The FES for a 4-nucleosome 197 NRL fiber in Figure 4D presents the various ways in which either motif can assemble. As in the case of a 187 NRL fiber, the increase in nucleosome repeat length allows for more complex nucleosome arrangements of α-/β-structures. As previous studies have suggested, shorter linker lengths form less flexible fibers, which have the advantage of exposing their DNA to transcription and replication machinery by the displacement of only a few
nucleosomes.29 The lack of a cohesive structure for longer linker lengths suggests that they are less stable and more prone
to opening as observed experimentally.30 At 8- and 16nucleosomes (Figure 4E,F), the liquid-like behavior of chromatin becomes more apparent. Representative structures for both fibers exhibit structural heterogeneity comprised of several α-tetrahedron and β-rhombus motifs. Our results are in line with ChromEMT experiments which have confirmed the presence of small clusters of ∼2−10-nucleosomes, and a lack of
larger organized structures.31 Our results suggest that these motifs arise due to an orchestrated set of interactions that are mainly driven by nucleosome−nucleosome interactions. The liquid-like behavior of chromatin is critical to gene expression since these dynamic changes directly affect DNA accessibility. Hi-C experiments have shown a correlation between the structural changes induced by the liquid-like
behavior of chromatin and gene expression levels.32 In addition, the changes in replication timing during cell differentiation have been suggested to involve the fluctuations
of TAD structures.33 Modeling studies using a simple polymer model of chromatin have shown that these TAD domains are
susceptible to the liquid-like movement of chromatin.34 The regulatory role of these intrinsically stable oligonucleosome motifs remains to be determined.

CONCLUSION
By analyzing long simulation trajectories generated by a coarsegrained multiscale chromatin model using nonlinear manifold learning, we resolved the spontaneous and intrinsic formation within the chromatin fiber of α-tetrahedron and β-rhombus motifstwo previously characterized tetranucleosomal conformations that play an important role in the accessibility of DNA. Our analysis showed that both motifs represent metastable states that correspond to local free energy minima and whose formation is not dependent on external factors such as post-translational modifications or protein remodeling complexes. We also characterized the effects that varying linker DNA length and nucleosome orientation have on the formation of these motifs and, by extension, local chromatin compaction. We observed that local chromatin compaction is induced by α-tetrahedron motifs that allow sterically unfavorable conformations to form such as kinks along the fiber. β-Rhombus conformations, on the other hand, were observed to form an open ladder-like chromatin structure that can facilitate DNA accessibility by external machinery such as transcription factors. Longer linker lengths are accompanied by
an increase in structural irregularity and flexibility and,
ultimately, a dynamic liquid-like “sea of nucleosomes”5,8 behavior that allows for constant structural reorganization. The lack of a cohesive structure for longer linker lengths suggests that they are less stable and more prone to opening and would require linker histones or some other chromatin architectural protein to fold into either conformation. This finding is in line with experimental observations which have shown that linker histone levels correlate positively with linker
DNA length.35 Here, we considered homogeneous linker lengths and were able to identify the formation of these two unique folding motifs. Hi-C methods, however, have revealed that these conserved motifs exist within heterogeneous
chromatin fibers as well.13 The effects by which variable linker lengths and tetranucleosome motifs influence the free energy landscape of chromatin folding require further investigation. Taken together, our results suggest a two-state model for the local chromatin structure, wherein extended β-rhombus motifs are more stable than compact α-tetrahedron motifs. It is possible that chromatin remodeling proteins and/or epigenetic status may be responsible for lowering the free energy barrier between the observed states. Future studies will require examining the mechanism by which linker histones and remodeling protein complexes, such as Polycomb, affect the emergence of metastable states. In addition, we are investigating the kinetic rates between each state using Markov-state models (MSM) to elucidate dynamical links between chromatin structure and gene expression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Simulating the Chromatin Fiber. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of chromatin fibers were
conducted using the 1CPN model (Figure 1).20 The model was parametrized by explicit experimental measurements and
finer-scaled models of DNA and proteins20 and incorporates and preserves molecular-level nucleosome physics while enabling kilobase-scale simulations of genomic DNA. Each nucleosome is represented by a single anisotropic site and DNA as a spherical particle at a three basepair-per-bead resolution. We refer interested readers to the detailed
descriptions found in prior publications.20,36,37 Simulations of 4-, 8-, and 16-nucleosomes at nucleosome repeat lengths 157, 187, and 197 were conducted in a periodic box at a temperature of 300 K and a simulation time step of 60 fs. Solvent was represented implicitly with a Langevin thermostat and salt concentration of 150 mM. Nucleosome interactions were represented by the Zewdie potential, which has been shown to be well-suited for representing internu
cleosomal interactions.38 To account for the stabilizing effects of the histone H3 tail of DNA entering and exiting the nucleosome, an additional pairwise interaction was introduced between the dyad and DNA sites. Electrostatic interactions
were incorporated using Debye−Hückel theory.39 Simulations were carried out using the LAMMPS molecular dynamics
package.40 Chromatin fibers were initialized in an extended state with the angle between entering and exiting DNA and the nucleosome at 180°. The root-mean-square deviation with respect to the first given frame achieved a steady state after a ∼100 μs equilibration period. The final configuration from the relaxation procedure was used as the initial starting structure for our production run and analysis. Five 30 μs replicas were conducted totaling 150 μs of simulation time for each

molecular trajectories.41−43 Assuming that the distance metric used to compare pairs of configurational microstates is a good proxy for short-time kinetic distance and that the conformational dynamics over the state space may be approximated as a diffusion process, the leading collective variables of the diffusion map correspond to the large-scale, high-variance collective motions of the system, and kinetically close
configurational microstates are embedded close together.24 We employ the density-adaptive variant of diffusion maps, which we find to be particularly useful for handling the large inhomogeneities in sampling densities observed in our
chromatin simulations.44 We provide a brief summary of the approach below, but direct the reader to prior publications for
mathematical and algorithmic details.24,41−43 Pairwise distances, dij, are calculated between data points in our set, xi and xj, which correspond to the RMSD between translationally and rotationally aligned nucleosomal coordinates in frames i and j of the simulation.

The transition matrix, M, is then diagonalized to calculate its eigenvectors ψi and eigenvalues λi. By the Markov property, the

Snapshot i of the molecular simulation trajectory is embedded into these collective variables spanning the so-called intrinsic manifold of the system under the mapping,
The ψk are the leading nonlinear collective variables identified
by the diffusion map that correspond to the high-variance dynamical modes of the system and are responsible for largescale conformational rearrangements. Free energy surfaces over the intrinsic manifold G(Ψ) are
computed by collecting histogram approximations P̂ to the observed distribution of configurational microstates projected into the leading k-eigenvectors Ψ = {ψi}ik=1 and then inverting this distribution using the relation
βG(Ψ) = − ln P̂(Ψ) + C (5)
where β = 1/(kBT) is the inverse temperature and C is an arbitrary additive constant that sets an absolute free energy
scale.45 By virtue of the interpretability of the eigenvectors as the leading collective modes of the system, the free energy surface constructed over the intrinsic manifold can resolve both the metastable macrostates of the chromatin structure
and the interconversion pathways between them.24 Diffusion maps have already been used successfully to examine the dynamics of DNA around histone proteins, thereby providing
precedent for our approach,43 but we note that we could have employed tICA, VAMPnets, or SRVs in conjunction with Markov-state models to identify kinetic microstates and
macrostates.46−50 These approaches have the benefit of furnishing kinetic networks without requiring that the assumption of diffusive dynamics be made. In the present work, it is the structure and thermodynamics of the metastable states that are of primary interest, as opposed to the kinetic transition rates, and for this reason we favor the smooth, continuous, and more structurally interpretable free energy surfaces furnished by diffusion maps.
