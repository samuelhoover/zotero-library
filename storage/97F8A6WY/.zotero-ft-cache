ABSTRACT
Biomolecular condensates can form through the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and RNAs in cells. However, other states of organization, including mesostructured network microstructures and physical gels, have been observed, the physical mechanism of which are not well understood. We use the Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model liquid state integral equation theory to study the equilibrium behavior of (generally aperiodic in sequence) biomolecular condensates based on a minimal sticker–spacer associating polymer model. The role of polymer packing fraction, sequence, and the strength and range of intermolecular interactions on macromolecular scale spatial organization and phase behavior is studied for typical sticker–spacer sequences. In addition to the prediction of conventional LLPS, a sequence-dependent strongly fluctuating polymeric microemulsion homogeneous state is predicted at high enough concentrations beyond the so-called Lifshitz-like point, which we suggest can be relevant to the dense phase of microstructured biomolecular condensates. New connections between local clustering and the formation of mesoscopic microdomains, the influence of attraction range, compressibility, and the role of spatial correlations across scales, are established. Our results are also germane to understanding the polymer physics of dense solutions of nonperiodic and unique sequence synthetic copolymers and provide a foundation to create new theories for how polymer diffusion and viscosity are modified in globally isotropic and homogeneous dense polymeric microemulsions.

I. INTRODUCTION
In just over a decade, a variety of experimental techniques, combined with computational tools and physical modeling, have contributed to our understanding of biomolecular condensates. Intrinsic disorder proteins (IDPs), proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and RNAs are found to form condensates in vitro.1–8 In vivo imaging techniques have also revealed that these molecules form clusters on the length scale of hundreds of nanometers in living cells.7 In vitro experiments show that condensate droplets often adopt a spherical morphology, are able to fuse, and exchange molecules with the surrounding environment on a relatively short timescale. Additionally, the condensate droplets are formed only beyond certain system-dependent
critical concentrations.9 In many systems, these condensates have characteristics of a liquid and are assumed to form through the classic liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) process.10 On the other hand, some biomolecules form nonspherical-shaped droplets that do not fuse, exchange molecules on a much longer timescale, and exhibit aging behavior.11 These droplets do not have the properties of a low-viscosity liquid and have been described as gels, glasses, and suspensions of solid-like aggregates. In addition, little is known about their internal local structure, mainly due to experimental limitations, which no doubt is intrinsically connected to the physical and material properties of the condensates. Mesh or locally microphased-separated-like structures12 and amorphous solids13,14 have been suggested to occur in some condensateforming systems. Thus, overall, the factors that govern the physical

and material properties of biomolecular condensates are not well understood. The microscopic driving forces for condensate formation include hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, π-interactions, electrostatic interactions,15 and valency-specific interactions.4 At a coarse-grained polymer physics level, a sticker–spacer model has been proposed corresponding to a polymer chain composed of attractive stickers that can form physical “bonds” connected by repulsive spacers,16 a model similar to how associating polymers are often described.17,18 The sticker–sticker attraction can result in interpolymer clustering and possible gelation into a time-persistent space-spanning network, and/or macroscopic phase separation (MaPS) into dilute and dense polymer phases induced by increasing sticker–sticker attraction, lowering temperature, or increasing macromolecular concentration. In the context of biomolecules, the purified disordered regions of FUS proteins form hydrogels at unphysiological concentrations and low temperatures.19 Theoretical and simulation studies of associative polymer solutions suggest that if biomolecular condensate concentration is beyond the percolation and saturation thresholds, the system undergoes a macrophase separation where the dense phase can be highly viscoelastic.17,20,21 Recently, microphase separation (MiPS) of sequence-specific charged heteropolymers has been studied using a field theoretic approach in the context of intrinsic disordered proteins.22 Simulations also find that there exists a phase at low to intermediate concentration where microscopic- or mesoscopicscale assemblies/clusters coexist without macrophase separation.23,24 Recently, an experimental study demonstrated the unexpected existence of mesoscale clusters below the saturation concentration,25 which has been argued not to be micellization nor microphase separation. The sticker–spacer model can be considered as a special type of copolymer, typically with an aperiodic sequence of sticky and nonsticky monomers. It is well known that under melt conditions, regular (periodic in sequence) block copolymers exhibit microphase separation into long-range ordered morphologies.26,27 The competition between macroscopic phase separation (MaPS) and microphase separation (MiPS) has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically28–34 in the context of a ternary melt composed of A and B homopolymers mixed with a AB diblock copolymer, where theoretically empirical chi-parameter(s) quantify interactions in the assumed incompressible melts. Mean field theory predicts that MiPS order–disorder transition lines meet the MaPS spinodal at a tri-critical point called the Lifshitz point for special choices of compositions, molecular weights, and chi-parameters. At a classic Lifshitz point, the disordered fluid, macrophase separated system, and long-range ordered microphase separated system coexist. In the context of mean field theory, the partial collective static structure factors simultaneously diverge at both zero and nonzero wavevector. However, experiments have found this Lifshitz point is suppressed or destroyed by some kind of fluctuation process and a globally homogeneous microemulsion one phase regime appears between the MaPS spinodal and the MiPS boundaries.28–32 It can be expected that similar behavior can occur for copolymer solutions, and the Lifshitz behavior has been demonstrated using RPA-based mean field theory for specific ranges of the multiple empirical chi-parameters that define the models adopted.33
At a minimum, the phase behavior and structure of the sticker–spacer model depend on copolymer concentration, the fraction of sticker monomers, the precise sequence of stickers and spacers, the overall chain length, conformational properties of the polymer (e.g., backbone stiffness), and the strength and range of intermolecular attractive interactions between stickers. In this study, we explore aspects of this richness using liquid state theory—the Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model (PRISM) integral equation approach—for the minimal sticker–spacer model. PRISM theory has been successfully applied to study the globally disordered but highly fluctuating state of regular copolymer melts and solutions, regular associating copolymers, macroscopic demixing in binary polymer blends, and assembly of block copolymers in solutions.35–47 Here, we apply this approach to deterministic but aperiodic copolymer sequences motivated by the biomolecular condensate problem. Our core findings include the prediction of a homogeneous disordered phase at high temperature or low strength of intermolecular attraction, typical macroscopic phase separation between dilute and dense polymer liquids for sufficiently low polymer concentration, and a strongly fluctuating globally homogeneous polymeric microemulsion-like phase at higher concentrations beyond a Lifshitz-like point. Recalling the tri-critical nature of the mean field Lifshitz point discussed above, we use the term “Lifshitz-like” for two practical reasons. First, PRISM theory contains correlated density and concentration fluctuations in a globally homogeneous state and (correctly) does not predict microphase separation spinodals associated with a literal divergence of the structure factor at finite wavevector. Second, we do not universally observe based on PRISM theory the simultaneous presence of both zero and finite wavevector structure factor peaks around the “Lifshitz-like” point in parameter space. Therefore, we adopt the “Lifshitz-like point” terminology not to denote a precise replication of the conditions at a Lifshitz tri-critical point but rather to distinguish between two distinct concentration fluctuation regimes. One is characterized by a dominant structure factor peak at zero wavevector, while the other is defined by a dominant peak at a finite wavevector,
denoted as k ∗ . The crossover regime from macroscopic demixing to a microemulsion phase and its connection to the Lifshitz point is a prime focus, and we find that the location and relative window in parameter space where this state of organization can exist depend on the sequence and the nature (including spatial range) of intermolecular attractive interactions. The real and Fourier space structure of the fluctuating polymeric microemulsion state of organization is of special interest. Complementary simulations are performed that qualitatively support our theoretical predictions as does the existence of an internally structured condensed phase found in simulations of a model of semiflexible polymers with attractive endcaps.48,49 More generally, we suggest our results are of interest to an emerging theme in polymer science and soft matter of creating and exploring the physical behavior and properties of controlled sequence, aperiodic chain molecules. In Sec. II, we describe the copolymer model, liquid state theories employed, and our simulation approach. The core predictions of PRISM theory for the baseline copolymer sequence and chain length of primary interest are presented in Sec. III for the phase diagram, macromolecular scale structure, cohesive energy, and a dimensionless local metric of clustering that signals the emergence

of microdomains. Section IV presents the corresponding simplified compressible PRISM-RPA theory results and contrasts them with the results of Sec. III that self-consistently treat local and long wavelength correlations. Simulations are presented in Sec. V that qualitatively support our theoretical results. Section VI briefly explores three extensions of PRISM theory to address the influence of the spatial range of the sticker–sticker attraction, the influence of attractions between non-stickers, and different biocondensatemotivated copolymer sequences. The article concludes in Sec. VII with a summary and future outlook. The Appendixes A and B provide detailed information relevant to the simulation, and a few additional theory results.
II. MODEL, THEORIES, AND SIMULATIONS
A. Model
Figure 1(a) shows the adopted minimal sticker (labeled B)spacer (labeled A) model.50,51 The diameter of the A/B spherical interaction sites is identical and denoted as σ. Unless stated otherwise, we take the A–B and A–A site–site interchain interactions to be of a purely repulsive hard core form: u(r) = 0 for r > σ and
∞ for r ≤ σ. The B–B interactions include the attraction and the only energy scale, which is modeled by a two-parameter (attraction energy at contact, −εBB, and spatial range in units of the site diameter, α) exponential form,
uBB(r) =
⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩
−εBB exp (−(r − σ)/α), r ≥ σ,
∞, r < σ. (1)
The reduced temperature is kBT/εBB and the total polymer pack
ing fraction is φ = πρσ3/6, where ρ is the total site number density. Without loss of generality, the length and energy scales are reported in units of σ and kBT, respectively. A single polymer is modeled as an ideal freely jointed chain (FJC) of N = 20 total sites with a bond
length of 4σ/3 typical of a relatively flexible polymer backbone.36,39
The radius of gyration is Rg ≈ 2.4σ. In the biocondensate context, we believe that use of the FJC model is a reasonable first-order approximation since it has been shown experimentally that no prominent secondary structure is observed for proteins inside the condensate phase.52,53 As the first attempt of applying PRISM theory to biomolecular condensates, we follow the specific model system construction used in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of Ref. 50. Most of the sequences studied in Ref. 50 have a sticky monomer composition corresponding to a fraction fB = 0.6, which is our focus. Below, we choose to present our most extensive results for the exemplary nonperiodic sequence BABBABBAABBAABBABBAB. Results for a few other sequences are then presented at the end of the article.
B. PRISM theory
PRISM theory35,36,39 is a well-established liquid state theory of homogeneous, isotropic, one phase polymer fluids that connects in a thermodynamic state and interaction-dependent manner the

(a) Sticker–spacer model16 for biomolecular condensates where a coarse-grained bead is envisioned to crudely represent a single amino acid residue with diameter σ. The B–B (sticky–sticky) sites attract via an exponential potential plus a hard core repulsion, and A–A/A–B sites interact solely as hard spheres. (b) Schematic of the pathways of spatial correlations in PRISM theory: g(r) is the site–site intermolecular pair correlation function, ω(r) is the

microemulsion-like state at εB∗B (green curve). The wavevector k ∗ is the position
of the fastest-growing peak of the BB collective structure factor. The MaPS spin
odal εB∗B is determined by the last converging value of εBB and the microemulsion
crossover εB∗B is determined by the linear extrapolation of 1/SBB(k ∗ ).

site–site intermolecular pair correlations, intramolecular pair correlations, and direct correlations [Fig. 1(b)] based on the generalized Ornstein–Zernike equation in Fourier space (wavevector, k),
H(k) = Ω(k)C(k)[Ω(k) + H(k)]. (2)
Here, for a system composed of M inequivalent interaction sites, H(k), Ω(k) and C(k) are M × M matrices the elements of which are, respectively, the Fourier transforms of the density-scaled site–site nonrandom part of the interchain site–site radial distribution function, the density-scaled intramolecular pair correlation function and the direct correlation function that describes effective or renormalized intermolecular pair interactions. Specifically, the entries in H(k) are Hαβ(k) = ρpair
αβ (k)hαβ(k), where ρpair
αβ = ραρβ with ρα and ρβ being the number density of sites of type α and β, respectively, and hαβ(k) is the Fourier transform of the intermolecular total or non
random part of the correlation function, hαβ(r) = gαβ(r) − 1, where
gαβ(r) is the site–site radial distribution function. The entries in Ω(k) are Ωαβ(k) = ρsite
αβ ωαβ(k), where ρsite
αβ = ρα + ρβ if α ≠ β and oth
erwise ρsite
αβ = ρα, and ωαβ(k) is the intramolecular correlation function described below. The entries of C(k) are Cαβ(k) = cαβ(k), which are the intermolecular direct correlation function. For copolymers, the precise sequence information is retained in Ω(k); however, for computational tractability the intermolecular correlations between every pair of sites of the same chemical identity are pre-averaged over the same type. Hence, the computational complexity is reduced from order N2 to M2. In this work, we model the solvent implicitly and consider AB copolymers, and hence M = 2.
The polymer sequence enters PRISM theory through ωαβ(k) (where subscripts α and β denote the site species), which is the Fourier transform of the probability distribution functions of distances between two sites along the chain averaged over the sites of the same chemical pair (neglecting chain end effects). For the FJC model of interest, ωαβ(k) for any given sequence of A and B monomers is given by (fixed bond (and persistence) length l = (4/3)σ),
ωαβ(k) = 1
Nαβ ∑i∈Jα ∑ j∈Jβ ( sin (kl)
kl )
∣i− j∣
, (3)
where Nαβ = Nα + Nβ if α ≠ β and Nαβ = Nα if α = β, Nα and Nβ are the number of monomers (sites) of types α and β, respectively, and Nα + Nβ = N where N is the total number of sites of the polymer chain. The symbols Jα and Jβ indicate the sets of indices for the monomer of type α and β, respectively. For any given sequence, the corresponding ωαβ(k) can be numerically computed using Eq. (3). In order to solve Eq. (2), we also need to specify a closure approximation for the direct correlation functions. Here, we adopt the mean spherical approximation (MSA) closure,39,54
cαβ(r) = −βuαβ(r), r > σ, (4)
where uαβ(r) is the tail potential between species α and β. Equation (4) relates the direct correlation function to the bare pair potential outside the hardcore in a simple manner. Since the focus of the present work is not the copolymer chain length dependence for which more advanced molecular closure are often required,39–41,55
this choice is made both for simplicity and (importantly) because it allows us to make direct connections between PRISM theory and coarse-grained mean field theories that employ the RPA. From H(k), Ω(k), and C(k), all the partial collective static structure factors can be calculated as
S(k) = Ω(k) + H(k) = [I − Ω(k)C(k)]−1Ω(k). (5)
Here, S(k) is a 2 × 2 matrix containing SAA(k), SAB(k) = SBA(k),
and SBB(k). A general condition for macroscopic spinodal phase
separation is limk→01/Sαβ(k) = 0 for all α and β. On the other hand, for microphase separation-like behavior, the collective structure factors grow fastest on a finite length scale with cooling, i.e., an intense
peak emerges in Sαβ(k ∗ ) at a characteristic nonzero wavevector k ∗ . We emphasize that there are no microphase spinodals in PRISM theory, or any liquid state integral equation theory with correlations that self-consistently treat attractive and repulsive interactions, in the sense that structure factors for any finite wavevector k do not diverge.37,40 Moreover, fluctuations in k-space, or correlations in real space, are coupled on all scales in PRISM theory, and the liquid state approach accounts for the consequences of chain connectivity on collective and interchain packing structure on all length scales.37 We numerically solve the PRISM equations Eq. (2) using the standard Newton–Krylov method built in the pyPRISM package.56 Following previous studies,57 we use 32 768 points in the real and reciprocal space, with a spacing in real space of Δr = 0.01. For every value of packing fraction, φ, we increase βεBB incrementally until the solution fails to converge. Since the compressible liquid model studied here has an asymmetric B–B attraction, the microphase scale structure factors grow most strongly with cooling or increasing attraction strength for SBB(k). We
thus analyze SBB(k) for the inferred signatures of macroscopic phase transition and the crossover to a fluctuating microemulsionlike state with local microphase organization. Following standard procedure,55,57,58 the spinodal curve for macroscopic phase separation is operationally constructed based on the converged solution for the maximum value of βεBB attainable. The crossover bound
ary to a microemulsion is constructed by extrapolating 1/SBB(k ∗ ) to 0 by drawing a tangent line from the the value of εBB at which
dS−1(k ∗ )/ dεBB is minimal. See Fig. 1(c) for details of the operational procedures, which are qualitatively the same as adopted in prior PRISM theory-based studies of homopolymer blends, diblock copolymer liquids, and telechelic and multiblock copolymer melts.40–44,55,59 As discussed below, we shall also explore a new alternative thermodynamics-based approach to determining the microemulsion crossover boundary.
C. Compressible PRISM-RPA theory
The RPA approach and coarse-grained field theory have been used in the study of the phase behavior of biomolecular condensates.60–62 However, the traditional RPA does not consistently treat intermolecular correlations between polymer chains and thus does not deliver reliable predictions for gαβ(r), nor for the collective structure factors on smaller length scales. Here, we will contrast our full PRISM theory results with a previously introduced compressible hybrid of liquid state theory and the RPA approach, called the PRISM-RPA theory.63 This cruder approach does rigorously enforce the intermolecular volume exclusion constraint and

for spatial correlations in a reference pure homopolymer melt but treats the tail part of the potential (B–B attraction) as a perturbation in a non-self-consistent manner typical of an RPA-like approximation. By the latter statement, we mean attractive interaction driven changes of structure are uncontrolled in the sense that interchain packing correlation functions do not rigorously obey the core exclusion constraint in their presence. This PRISM-RPA method has been shown to provide computationally easy and fast calculation of macrophase and microphase spinodal curves for other systems, but it is not expected to be reliable for accurately predicting sticky monomer clustering and microdomain formation, nor (of course) local packing structure in the presence of strong clustering. It can potentially yield useful results on a relatively large length scale, though to what extent is a priori unknown. In addition, unlike coarse-grained field theories based on the incompressible RPA,26,27 the symmetry-like condition that SAA(k) = SBB(k) = −SAB(k) is not assumed in the PRISM-RPA calculation since total density fluctuations are retained in the compressible liquid model. We expect (and show below) the latter is important for the asymmetric interaction sticker–spacer model studied in this article. Since the collective structure factors are given by
S(k) = [I − Ω(k)C(k)]−1Ω(k), (6)
where all the partial structure factors have a common denominator,
Λ(k) = det (I − Ω(k)C(k)), (7)
when Λ = 0 and k = 0 a spinodal macrophase separation is predicted, and all partial structure factors diverge simultaneously. A literal microphase separation spinodal (if it exists, e.g., within PRISM
RPA) corresponds to Λ(k ∗ ) = 0 where k ∗ is the characteristic wavevector at which all partial structure factors first diverge upon
cooling, changing attraction strength, or some other control variable. For the AB copolymer model of present interest, Λ(k) is given by
Λ(k) = 1 − ρAωAA(k)cAA(k) − ρBωBB(k)cBB(k)

where ρA and ρB are the number density of site of species A
and B, respectively, and ρAB = ρA + ρB. Mathematically, the PRISM
RPA approach approximates the direct correlation function C(k) as consisting of two independent parts,
cαβ(k) = c0
αβ(k) + Δcαβ(k) (9)
where α and β denotes the chemical species, c0
αβ(k) is the Fourier transform of the direct correlation function in the athermal (homopolymer) limit, and Δcαβ(k) is the correction term due to the tail potential (B–B attraction in this context),
Δcαβ(r) =
⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩
0, r ≤ σ,
−(1/kBT)uαβ(r), r > σ. (10)
For the attractive potential model of present interest, uBB(r)
= −εBB exp (−(r − σ)/α), and thus ΔcBB(k) is given by
ΔcBB(k) = ∫

k(1 + k2α2)2 . (11b)
To compute the spinodal curve using the PRISM-RPA approach, we first perform full PRISM theory calculations to obtain the c0
αβ(k) for the hard core reference homopolymer liquid. Then, Λ(k) = 0 is solved from Eq. (8) for various values of εBB and k.
In principle, Λ(k) = 0 can have multiple or an infinite number of
solutions of (εBB, k). In practice, we compute the spinodal curve by
finding the smallest value of εBB at which Λ(k) equals zero at any
value of k, i.e., minεBB,kΛ(k, εBB) = 0. Typically, for large φ, Λ(k)
becomes zero at finite k at εB∗B, which leads to a microscopic phase separation (MiPS) branch of the phase boundaries.
D. Simulations
For a more comprehensive understanding and preliminary qualitative test of the theoretical results, we also performed Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular
Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) Molecular Dynamics package.64 The Hamiltonian of the polymer model adopted in the simulation is given by the connectivity term modeled as harmonic bond potential and nonbonded pair-wise potentials between all monomers. The A–A and A–B interactions are purely repulsive Weeks–Chandler–Andersen (WCA) potentials65 with σ = 1, and
the B–B interaction is the Lennard-Jones potential with σ = 1. The strength of the interactions is controlled by the parameter ε, which is the same for A–A, B–B, and A–B pairs. Note that reduced units are used. All systems contain M = 2000 polymer chains. For faster convergence of the coexistence of dilute and dense phases, we employ the slab method that is commonly used in other simulation studies for LLPS.66,67 The simulation box is orthogonal and has periodic boundary conditions. The length along the z-dimension is three times the length along x- and y-dimensions, whose values vary accordingly to achieve the target volume fraction/number density

under study. The center of the mass of the whole system is set to be at origin after each time step to prevent overall translational movement of the condensed phase. More technical details of the simulations are provided in Appendix A. Several caveats should be noted for comparison between simulation and theory. First, the simulation uses the Lennard-Jones and WCA potentials for computational convenience, whereas the minimal parameter exponential attractive and hardcore potential are employed in our PRISM theory calculations. Hence, a direct quantitative comparison between the simulations and theory is not appropriate nor is it our goal. Rather, we aim to provide a qualitative test of our key theoretical predictions. Second, we do not construct the full phase diagram from our simulation data since it is far beyond the scope of this work. Instead, we simulate the system under a few conditions that cover different regions of the phase map predicted by the theory. We also observe the signatures of long-range ordered microphase separation in our simulation for strong enough attractive interactions, although finite-size effects preclude us from definitively determining whether it is a true disorder-to-order transition. Since phase transitions to a long-range microphase separated state are not treated by PRISM theory, the comparison between our theory and simulation in this case is problematic and not discussed.
III. PRISM THEORY PREDICTIONS
A. Phase diagrams and crossovers: Qualitative aspects
Before presenting our proposed phase diagram for a typical sticker–spacer model based on our numerical PRISM theory, we
first discuss the predictions of mean field RPA-type based theory. Figure 2(a) shows a typical phase diagram of the sticker–spacer model predicted by our compressible PRISM-RPA approach. Literal divergence of structure factors can occur at both zero and nonzero wavevectors, leading to MaPS and MiPS spinodal curves. Typically, the MiPS spinodal signals an order–disorder phase transition (ODT) into a long-range microphase order phase. Depending on the specific system parameters, our PRISM-RPA theory calculations can also predict a tri-critical Lifshitz point (intersection between MiPS and MaPS, diamond marker) at which three different phases coexist (disordered homogeneous liquid, macroscopically phase separated state associated with liquid–liquid demixing, and microphase ordered phase), and there is a simultaneous divergence of all partial collective structure factor at k = 0 and a nonzero k. However, for some system parameter choices, or a different interaction model (e.g., the baseline asymmetric attractive interaction model we mainly focus on), we find continuous shifting of the structure factor peak from zero wavevector to nonzero wavevector at the intersection between the MiPS and MaPS spinodal boundaries. The existence of such a Lifshitz point even in compressible PRISM-RPA theory thus depends on nonuniversal details,33 e.g., choice of attractive potentials and sequence. The question of existence of a Lifshitz point has been experimentally studied in great depth for ternary mixtures of an A/B homopolymer blend plus AB (typically diblock) copolymer melt. Special choices of chain lengths and compositions are used in an attempt to realize the conditions required for a mean field tricritical Lifshitz point to exist. However, for such systems it has

Here, φ is the polymer total packing fraction and εBB is the attraction strength between sticker sites. (a) Qualitative phase diagram at the spinodal level based on traditional mean field RPA theory and our compressible PRISM-RPA theory calculations. The MaPS and MiPS spinodals are predicted to meet at a point in the phase diagram (marked by diamond). The nature of this intersection depends on the specific divergence behavior of the static structure factors. If the structure factors simultaneously diverge at both zero and nonzero wavevector at this intersection, it becomes the so-called tri-critical Lifshitz point. Depending on the specific model parameters, we also observe cases when there is only continuous shifting of the structure factor peak at the intersection. Below the solid MiPS spinodal curve, a long-range microphase ordered state is expected. The dashed blue curve is the metastable extension of the MaPS spinodal. (b) Proposed qualitative phase diagram based on our PRISM theory calculations. Here, all MiPS spinodals are destroyed by fluctuations and are replaced with a crossover boundary that signals a continuous, but relatively sharp, change from a homogeneous fluid to a structured fluid characterized by microemulsion-like clustering (μ). The intersection between the MaPS and MiPS spinodals in panel (a) is replaced by a “Lifshitz-like” point (circle marker), beyond which the dominant structure factor peak is
at a nonzero low wavevector. Similar to PRISM-RPA theory, near the Lifshitz-like point the structure factor can have either two peaks (at k = 0 and a nonzero small k = k ∗ )
or a single peak depending on the specific choice of interaction model and parameters. We note that the precise location of this Lifshitz-like point is difficult to determine computationally since it fundamentally is a smooth crossover and also because we are limited by numerical resolution in the PRISM theory calculations. The short-dashed (relatively vertical) red curve is meant to schematically indicate a phase boundary below the Lifshitz-like point that corresponds to coexistence of a dilute polymer fluid and a concentrated microemulsion. This boundary cannot be rigorously predicted by PRISM theory alone, rather it has been inferred based on our PRISM theory calculations and complementary simulations as described in the main text.

been demonstrated experimentally that the MiPS order–disorder transition and macroscopic MaPS phase boundaries do not intersect as expected from mean field theory. Instead, fluctuation effects destroy the Lifshitz point resulting in a channel in between these two types of phase boundaries where the system is found to be in a globally homogeneous and isotropic polymeric microemulsionlike state. We expect such a fluctuation-induced microemulsion can be predicted by PRISM theory as a continuous, but perhaps sharp, crossover phenomenon associated with local microdomain formation and strong clustering of like (especially sticky) monomers for our effectively single-species copolymer fluid model based on an implicit solvent description. Figure 2(b) shows the proposed generic phase diagram for a typical sticker–spacer model based on our numerical PRISM theory results described in detail below. At high temperatures, the system is a homogeneous one phase fluid. When temperature is reduced, the system either undergoes macroscopic phase separation (MaPS) or a continuous crossover to a microstructured microemulsion (μ),
depending on the total polymer packing fraction. The MaPS is a density-driven transition (ala a liquid–vapor transition) corresponding to the coexistence of a polymer-poor (solvent-rich) dilute phase and a polymer-rich (solvent-poor) dense phase. The crossover (not a thermodynamic phase transition) to a microemulsion-like state (μ) is characterized by the emergence of a fast-growing peak in the collective structure factors at a finite wavevector, indicating a transition from a homogeneous isotropic disordered structure to a mesoscopically structured state with spacer-rich and sticker-rich microdomains. The shift of the peak in the structure factors from zero wavevector to a finite value occurs at the intersection of the MaPS spinodal and the crossover boundary, marked by a circle in Fig. 2(b). Similar to the PRISM-RPA theory results, at this intersection point the structure factor can simultaneously have two peaks indicating large fluctuations on macroscopic (k = 0) and micro
scopic (k ∗ ) scales or only a single peak continuously shifting from zero wavevector to nonzero low wavevector as the dimensionless temperature is decreased.

In PRISM theory, there are no literal divergence of structure factors at nonzero k, which is the physically correct result beyond a RPA-based mean field theory. Of course, based only on the PRISM theory, we cannot exclude the existence of a true disorder–order transition. However, unlike a typical synthetic copolymer (e.g., regular diblock or triblock with blocks of relatively high molecular weight) where order–disorder microphase separation (MiPS) is observed, its existence is not guaranteed for the nonperiodic sequences and short polymers investigated in our present work.
B. Macromolecular scale structure factors
As stated above, our main results are for an exemplary sequence BABBABBAABBAABBABBAB; results for a few other sequences are presented in Sec. VI C. Unless stated otherwise, all calculations are for an attraction range of α = 0.5σ. The primary control parameters are thus the total polymer packing fraction, φ, and the sticker–sticker interaction strength in units of thermal energy, βεBB. Figure 3 shows representative full numerical PRISM theory results for the macromolecular length scale structure that is the prime focus of the present work over a range of values of φ and kBT/εBB. Due to the asymmetric B–B attraction, we focus on the most sensitive to clustering and microdomain formation partial structure factor, SBB(k). Figure 3(a) shows
that at φ = 0.24, SBB(k) shows no characteristic peaks at low
sticker attractions (less than thermal energy), and the k = 0 fluctuations grow with increasing attraction. For larger values of βεBB, SBB(k) develops an increasingly intense nonzero
wavevector peak that shifts to small length scales (2π/k ∗ ), and
k = 0 macroscopic concentration fluctuations (osmotic compressibility of B monomers) are increasingly suppressed. Such nonmonotonic behavior of SBB(k = 0) occurs only near the Lifshitz-like point (a narrow range of φ) as we discuss below. Figure 3(b) shows the evolution of the inverse of SBB(0) and
SBB(k ∗) as εBB increases. The bifurcation of 1/SBB(0) and 1/SBB(k ∗)
shows that the finite wavevector peak grows continuously from k = 0
as SBB(0) decreases. No simultaneous two-peak structure is found at any value of βεBB and φ for the asymmetric attractive tail model employed. Figure 3(c) shows the detailed non-monotonic behavior of SBB(0) for φ > 0.24 but close to 0.24. At a sufficiently high polymer packing fraction, this dimensionless B-monomer osmotic compressibility does behave monotonically as a function of εBB. In qualitative contrast, for φ < 0.24, the system shows a distinct behavior
whereby SBB(k = 0) diverges as εBB increases, indicating the system approaches a macroscopic phase separation (MaPS) spinodal, which is the conventional liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) discussed in the context of biomolecular condensates. Given that PRISM theory captures compressibility effects and coupled density and concentration fluctuations, it is of interest to examine how the total (density fluctuation-density fluctuation) structure factor changes as a function of φ. Such a quantity is generally relevant to small angle x-ray scattering measurements in contrast to small angle neutron scattering experiments that exploit H/D isotopic labeling. In traditional incompressible RPA-based approaches, this quantity is assumed to be zero. This dimensionless total structure factor is
S(k) = (ρASAA(k) + ρBSBB(k) + 2(ρA + ρB)SAB(k))/(ρA + ρB). (12)
Figure 3(d) shows that for βεBB = 2 a prominent peak is present
near the Lifshitz-like point, φ = 0.24, reflecting the strong coupling of density and concentration fluctuations in PRISM theory. The relatively intense peak of SBB(k) at φ = 0.24 reflects large density fluctuations at the corresponding length scale. Physically, it suggests that the structure is not homogeneous but has “void” and “dense” regions, which we confirm by the simulations in Sec. V. The total structure factor exhibits a peak height that decreases with increasing φ and eventually vanishes at very high φ, where an incompressibility idealization is most relevant since the RPA-like simplification SAA = SBB = −2SAB begins to become accurate.
C. Quantitative phase behavior
To construct the “phase diagram” using PRISM theory, we follow standard practice in integral equation theory studies and determine the MaPS spinodal using the last converged results for SBB(k = 0) if it is the fastest growing at the largest value of εBB. When the structure factor peak is at a finite value of the wavevector, we use the extrapolated mean field criterion to characterize the crossover boundary to the microemulsion state. In essence, we extrapolate
the higher temperature close-to-linear part of 1/SBB(k ∗ ) vs inverse temperature to zero to determine the critical εBB [see Fig. 1(c) and methods section for details]. Figure 4(a) shows the computed phase boundary for the exemplary sequence BABBABBAABBAABBABBAB. There are two branches: the spinodal transition boundary for MaPS with SBB(k)
diverging at k = 0 (blue) and the crossover boundary that continuously (i.e., the dominant wavevector peak shifts continuously from k = 0 to a nonzero value) separates the homogeneous liquid state and a strongly clustered microemulsion-like state (green) associated with the strong growth of SBB(k) at a finite value of k. For this particular copolymer system, the MaPS boundary comes close to intersecting the microemulsion crossover boundary at φ ≈ 0.22 − 0.24, which we
denote as the Lifshitz-like point, (φL, TL). It is worth pointing out that the relatively low value of φL is consistent with the experimental finding that the volume fraction of polymer inside biomolecular condensates is estimated to be in the range of 20%–35%.9,68,69 This packing fraction is also consistent with the porous microstructure picture suggested by the total structure factors [Fig. 3(d)] and demonstrated in our simulations (see Sec. V).
Since the SBB(k ∗) grows rapidly at large values of βεBB and numerical convergence of the algorithm to solve the coupled integral equations eventually becomes too difficult, the numerical PRISM theory analysis does not probe the system beyond a certain maximal value of εBB. Nevertheless, the so-constructed phase diagram or map implies the system can be divided into four different regimes [Fig. 4(a)]: a homogeneous phase with no (significant) internal structure on the microdomain scale (I), a two phase region with a dense liquid phase and a dilute phase (II), a one phase microemulsion regime (IV), and another two phase region where the dense phase has internal microemulsion-like structure (III). In regime (I), SBB(k) has no prominent peak at a finite k other than the typi
cal cage scale packing peak on the monomer or site level, kσ ∼ 7.
For φ < φL, the system phase separates into a dense and a dilute phase by lowering the temperature, a conventional LLPS spinodal boundary, indicated by the divergence of SBB(k) at k = 0 [Fig. 3(c)].
The predicted SBB(k) close to the spinodal show no characteristic

FIG. 4. Spinodal level phase diagrams for macroscopic phase separation (MaPS) (blue curve) and the microemulsion crossover (green curve) for the shown baseline sequence based on the full PRISM theory. (a) Reduced MaPS and crossover temperatures as a function of total polymer packing fraction. The critical point for MaPS (φc, Tc) and the end point of the MaPS spinodal curve, (φL, TL), are marked. The
phase diagram has four regimes: a homogeneous phase (I); a two phase regime with unstructured polymer fluids of dilute and dense phases (II); a two phase regime with a structured dense phase (III); a single mesoscopically ordered but globally homogeneous and isotropic microemulsion phase (IV). The red dasheddotted line is the crossover determined from the dimensionless cohesive energy quantity discussed in Fig. 6(c); the red box indicates uncertainty associated with practical factors discussed in the main text and in relation to Fig. 2(b). (b) Nondimensionalized (by site diameter or Rg) ordering wavevectors as a function of total polymer volume fraction for fixed values of βεBB.

finite low wavevector peak, implying that the dense phase is without emergent internal structure. For higher density φ > φL, the system remains in a one phase region at low temperature. The boundary separating regimes (I) and (IV) is the crossover below which SBB(k) grows quickly at a finite low wavevector to become the highest peak indicating a microemulsion state characterized by well-defined microdomains of stickers. Finally, a regime III at sufficiently low temperature and φ < φL is indicated. We emphasize that this regime is not directly accessible in PRISM theory as it is below the MaPS spinodal and thus in the thermodynamically unstable region. If we adopt the reasonable assumption that the system also undergoes a macroscopic phase separation into a polymer-poor and polymerrich phase in regime III, and if the volume fraction of the dense coexisting phase is larger than φL, then our PRISM calculations suggest that the dense phase is in regime IV and is likely of a structured microemulsion nature [Fig. 4(b)]. Based on this perspective (which is supported by our simulations discussed below), we separate regimes III and IV in the figure but do not draw a precise phase boundary between them since it cannot be determined from PRISM theory alone. Scanning along φ at fixed βεBB shows that the ordering
wavevector k ∗ changes either continuously or discontinuously from zero with increasing polymer packing fraction depending on the value of εBB [Fig. 4(b)]. However, such changes are sharp even for the continuous case, and hence in a practical sense the two behaviors are
not so different. At large values of φ, k ∗ tends to saturate at a value that decreases as the sticker attraction grows, suggesting a larger structural ordering length scale. It can be observed that the ordering
length scale (2π/k ∗ ) is about twice that of the radius of gyration, Rg.
The evolution of k ∗ as a function of εBB at fixed φ demonstrates that
near the Lifshitz-like point, the k ∗ corresponds to the simple correlation hole effect associated with chain connectivity that is present even at small values of εBB, shifts to zero as εBB increases (macroscopic osmotic fluctuations dominate), and eventually continuously grows from zero to the final saturating value at large εBB [Fig. 4(c)].
Only very close to the Lifshitz-like point does k ∗ vanish in a window of εBB values, which shrinks and eventually disappears with increas
ing φ. At high volume fraction φ, we find that k ∗ continuously shifts from the correlation hole peak to the large length scale ordering
value at high εBB. The values of k ∗ saturate at high εBB around k ∗ σ ≈
0.5–0.8 (∼3 to 5 Rg) and its saturation value slightly increases with increasing φ.
D. Microdomain length scale and coherence length
To further quantify the microemulsion, we compute more precisely the primary real space microdomain ordering length scale
defined as L = 2π/k ∗ . Figure 5(a) shows that at high βεBB, L saturates at values in the range of 7–10σ. By comparison, the average end-toend distance for a single polymer chain is about 6σ and Rg ∼ 2.4σ, suggesting (as expected) that microdomains are formed through polymer-level clustering. The solid markers in Fig. 5(a) indicate the location of the critical εBB, which defines the crossover boundary in Fig. 4(a). Next, we compute the microdomain coherence length, defined here as ξ = 1/Δk1/2, where Δk1/2 is the full-width at half-maximum
of SBB(k ∗ ). The coherence length characterizes the length scale over which the microdomains are spatially correlated. For strong enough

microdomain scale segregation, one expects it can be significantly larger than the individual microdomain size and Rg. This is indeed what PRISM theory predicts. Figure 5(b) shows the coherence length growth in units of the radius of gyration, ξ/Rg, as a function of εBB. The coherence length grows strongly beyond the crossover value of εBB (solid markers), demonstrating that the latter value heralds the onset of strong clustering or microdomain scale concentration fluctuations. We note that the curves of ξ/Rg collapse for
βεBB < 1–1.5 and then grow slowly. For very small values of
εBB, one has ξ/Rg < 1, suggesting very weak correlation between
microdomains. At large εBB, the growth of ξ for φ = 0.3 seems to be different from other values of φ, whereas the growth is insensitive to packing fraction if φ > 0.3. Figure 5(c) plots (ξ/σ)−2 vs βεBB per a standard Ornstein–Zernike representation. The dashed line has a slope of −1 and is shown as a guide to the eye and to contrast with
mean field RPA-based field theory, which predicts (ξ/σ)2 ∝ βεBB at high temperatures and diverges at the spinodal. It can be observed that for the intermediate volume fraction near the Lifshitz-like point
at φ ∼ 0.3, the PRISM theory curve deviates from the mean field prediction significantly due to microdomain scale correlation effects,
as expected. Additionally, Fig. 5(d) plots SBB(k ∗ ) vs the coherence length ξ on log–log scale. The black solid line has a slope of 1.7, in
contrast with mean field theory that predicts SBB(k ∗ ) ∼ ξ2.
E. Local measure of clustering and emergence of microdomains
Because both the microdomain ordering length L and the coherence length ξ change continuously below and beyond the crossover values of εBB, it is unclear to what extent the crossover boundary, defined by the small wavevector based extrapolation
of SBB(k ∗ )−1 procedure, is a unique metric for the emergence of a microemulsion-like state. Moreover, PRISM theory correctly predicts polymer-scale clustering and microdomain formation is “nucleated” at the elementary monomer scale driven by lowering the system energy via the short-range attractive potentials between

sticker (B) sites.37,59 Such local clustering of sticker sites on different copolymer chains can be readily observed in the B–B radial distribution function gBB(r). Figure 6(a) shows the near contact gBB(r) grows significantly as βεBB increases. The consequences of such local clustering effects are then “propagated” to the macromolecular scale via chain connectivity correlations in PRISM theory.37,39,59
To explore a possible connection between the 1/k ∗ microdomain scale and local clustering scale correlations, we define a dimensionless local structure based quantity quantifying sticker clustering on the attractive interaction scale [Fig. 6(b)] as
̂uBB( ̂εBB) = 1
2 ρBε−1
BB ∫
∞
0
4πr2gBB(r)uBB(r), (13)
where uBB(r) is the sticker–sticker attractive pair potential and
̂εBB = εBB/εB∗B where εB∗B is the inferred crossover value from analysis
of 1/SBB(k ∗ ). We shall refer to this (negative) quantity of Eq. (13) as a dimensionless cohesive energy. Figure 6(b) shows it initially decreases weakly as βεBB increases from zero, then more strongly decreases as B monomers begin to strongly cluster beyond a threshold strength of dimensionless attraction. We note that since the number of nearest neighbors from other copolymer chains near a tagged sticker monomer can only grow to a finite maximum value in the low temperature limit due to excluded volume repulsions, the dimensionless cohesive energy should eventually saturate as βεBB ≫ 1. Such saturation would result in an inflection point in the dimensionless cohesive energy, signaling the value of dimensionless attraction energy at which its rate of change is a maximum. From Fig. 6(b), one sees an inflection point is present, but it is a relatively subtle feature over the range of dimensionless attraction strengths accessible to numerical PRISM theory. The above behavior motivates us to consider the negative derivative of the dimensionless compressibility, −d ̂uBB/ d ̂εBB, which will exhibit a positive peak that might serve as a useful thermodynamic metric based on local structure of the crossover to a strongly clustered microemulsion-like structure. Interestingly, Fig. 6(c) shows the peak occurs at ̂εBB ≈ 1 for φ values well beyond
φL. Hence, − d ̂uBB/ d ̂εBB is not only a useful local metric for the onset of strong clustering, but its peak nearly coincides with the dimensionless attraction strength determined by the mean field-like
linear extrapolation procedure of k ∗ scale sticker–sticker concentration fluctuations [see Fig. 4(a)]. This is a new insight in the context of PRISM theory, and it further reinforces the fundamental and consistent connection between local sticky monomer clustering in real space and the emergence of microdomains on a much larger scale in PRISM theory. We note that for φ = 0.24 − 0.26 close
to the Lifshitz-like point, the maximum of −d ̂uBB/ d ̂εBB is broad, and thus there is some uncertainty in its location as indicated by the dashed box in Fig. 4(a). This behavior is likely also reflected in the non-monotonic behavior of the crossover determined by the long wavelength structure factor extrapolation procedure, and physically it arises from the coexistence of strong macroscopic and microdomain scale fluctuations in the Lifshitz-like region. We emphasize that the above analysis is only possible since the attraction-driven local clustering in real space is consistent with enforcing the excluded volume constraint due to intermolecular

repulsive interactions in PRISM theory. It cannot be reliably done using coarse mean field theory or any approach that adopts the RPAlike approximation for which predictions on local scales of gBB(r) are unreliable or nonexistent, and the degree of clustering is not limited by steric packing constraints.
IV. COMPRESSIBLE PRISM-RPA THEORY PREDICTIONS
As discussed in Sec. II C, PRISM-RPA theory provides a computationally efficient way to explore the parameter space as it requires the full numerical PRISM calculation only for the athermal reference homopolymer fluid. It also allows one to determine (hypothetical) mean field microphase separation spinodals, which can be compared with classic incompressible mean field theories of polymer physics. Here, we investigate and compare the results between the full PRISM and PRISM-RPA theories to establish both the utilities and drawbacks of PRISM-RPA. Since the RPA-based PRISM theory calculations predict unphysical spinodals for microphase separation, i.e., literal diver
gences of the structure factors at k ∗ , comparison with the full
PRISM theory calculations of many properties is not appropriate. On the other hand, one can compare the “phase diagrams” of PRISM-RPA theory and the full PRISM theory, and this is done in Fig. 7(a). Agreement is not quantitative, but qualitative features appear to be largely consistent for both the macrophase separation boundary and the location of emergence of a microemulsion-like state. Curiously, one sees even good quantitative agreement between the location of the microphase spinodal boundary predicted by PRISM-RPA theory and the microemulsion crossover boundary predicted by full PRISM theory. A priori, there is no compelling reason for such near quantitative agreement, and it may be fortuitous. On the other hand, it provides some evidence for the usefulness of PRISM-RPA theory to estimate the boundary for the emergence of the polymer microemulsion state. To compare PRISM-RPA and the full PRISM theories for structure factors, microdomain ordering length, and coherence length. Figure 7(b) shows the total and partial structure factors predicted by PRISM-RPA for φ = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5. Although the structure factors do not (and cannot) agree with the full PRISM calculation quantitatively, their primary features are correctly captured [see Fig. 3(d) of full PRISM results for comparison]. On the other hand, the

are shown as the solid circle curves. For this specific system, the PRISM-RPA theory MiPS boundary deduced from a literal divergence at k = k ∗ almost perfectly overlaps

microdomain ordering lengths, L, predicted by PRISM-RPA theory do not show the saturation plateau at large βεBB as observed in the full PRISM result [Figs. 5(a) and 7(c)], reflecting the uncontrolled effect of attractive interactions on clustering in an RPA-based approach. Moreover, the coherence lengths exhibit literal divergence at the spinodal in PRISM-RPA [Fig. 7(d)], in massive contrast to the full PRISM predictions [Fig. 5(b)]. Classic field theories use not only the RPA but also embed intermolecular interactions in phenomenological chi-parameters, and a literal incompressibility approximation is also usually adopted. These approximations result
in a k ∗ that does not evolve with temperature since it is determined solely by single copolymer connectivity correlations and sequence.
Thus, we can surmise that the T-dependence of k ∗ in PRISM-RPA theory comes from Δcαβ(k). However, the resulting T-dependence
of k ∗ behaves very differently from the full PRISM theory analog, again demonstrating it is important to include self-consistency between microscopic repulsive and attractive interactions and their consequences on fluctuation effects as the full PRISM theory does. Together, the comparisons between full PRISM and PRISMRPA results show that the computationally simple PRISM-RPA theory may be useful for the fast-scanning of phase diagrams for a wide range of parameters, and some of the results can be expected to be qualitatively similar to the full PRISM theory
predictions. However, at a quantitative level, and for some questions at a qualitative level, major differences are expected even on the larger microdomain lengths scales, and the PRISM-RPA approach is not reliable for understanding the full temperature evolution of the microdomain ordering length and coherence length scales, the
intensity of SBB(k ∗ ), nor interchain pair correlations on any shorter length scale.
V. SIMULATIONS
We have performed Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations (described in the method section) to test the qualitative validity of our core PRISM theory predictions. The goal is not to make quantitative comparisons between simulation and theory but rather to primarily check the four different phase regimes predicted by the theory. We first estimate the condition for the emergence of these different regimes by visual inspection of the simulation snapshots [Figs. 8(a)–8(d)]. Figure 8(a) shows a single homogeneous liquid phase at a low total polymer packing fraction φ = 0.05, which appears to be close to the macrophase separation transition as indicated by the strong growth of SBB(k = 0) [Fig. 9(a)]. Upon cooling (increasing εBB), the system clearly phase separates into a dilute

and a dense phase [Fig. 8(b)]. The dense phase has a packing fraction of φ ≈ 0.15, roughly three times larger than the bulk value. We then compute the sticker–sticker partial structure factor only for the dense phase [marked by the blue box in Fig. 8(b)]. The result shows that SBB(k) is maximal at k = 0 without any sign of a low wavevector peak [Fig. 9(a)]. This demonstrates that the dense phase can be characterized as a typical homogeneous liquid state without an emergent internal structure. As the system is cooled further (by increasing εBB), the dense phase becomes more compact, attaining a packing fraction of φ ≈ 0.2 [Fig. 8(c)]. Now, SBB(k) of the dense
phase does exhibit a low wavevector peak at k ∗ σ ≈ 1 [Fig. 9(a)], suggesting emergent microdomain formation in the dense phase. This is supported by visual inspection of the simulation snapshot [Fig. 8(c)], which shows a microemulsion-like structure with local clustering of stickers, in contrast to no clear local clustering of either stickers or spacers shown in Fig. 8(b). At an even higher packing fraction of φ = 0.3, we observe that the system does not macroscopically phase
separate even at βεBB = 2. This deduction is supported by our finding that the volume fraction of the dense coexisting phase for the φ = 0.05 system is φdense = 0.2, which is significantly smaller than
0.3. At φ = 0.3, we find that the system remains as a single globally homogeneous phase with clear microemulsion-like characteristics [Fig. 8(d)]. These simulation results are all qualitatively consistent with the theoretical predictions where Figs. 8(a)–8(d) correspond to the phase regime I, II, III, IV in Fig. 4, respectively. We have also computed the total density fluctuation—density fluctuation structure factor Stot(k) for φ = 0.05, 0.17, 0.3 with fixed
βεBB = 2 [Fig. 9(b)]. Stot(k) is calculated for the dense phase if the
system is in a two phase regime. The peak of Stot(k) at finite wavevector suggests large density fluctuations inside the dense coexisting phase. Visual inspection of the structure suggests that the spacer and sticker monomers are not space-filling in the dense phase [Figs. 8(e) and 8(f)]. Instead, there are voids (lower density regions) and clusters (high-density regions) throughout the dense phase, which give rise to the finite wavevector peak of Stot(k). The voids are present at both conditions depicted in Figs. 8(e) and 8(f) but to different degrees, which is a natural consequence of the difference in total density of the dense coexisting phase. Furthermore, the density of the dense phase and its Stot(k) for φ = 0.05 and φ = 0.17
at the same temperature (βεBB) match each other, suggesting that their dense phases have the same internal structure. These results show that the system with two different values of total volume fractions at fixed temperature macrophase separate into polymerpoor and polymer-rich phases with the same dense coexisting phase density and internal structures. This suggests that there exists a binodal curve between regimes III and IV [Fig. 4(a), and sketched in Fig. 2(b)]. However, recall that PRISM theory is unable to directly determine such a boundary. Rather, by combining simulation and PRISM theory results, we are able to infer the separation of regimes III and IV.
VI. EXTENSIONS OF THE MODEL
In this section, we briefly consider three different generalizations of the copolymer model employed in our studies above. Many additional extensions are possible that are also relevant to the biocondensate problem, which are briefly discussed in the final outlook section.
A. Effect of sticker–sticker attraction range
Various types of intermolecular attractions can play a role in the formation of biomolecular condensates15 and also synthetic copolymers. We expect chemically specific attractive interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or π-interactions, to have a significantly shorter range than the size of one coarse-grained monomer in our model (one amino acid, ∼1 nm). Thus, we ask how does the range of sticker–sticker attraction affect phase behavior? Note that in typical polymer physics mean field theories, such a parameter does not enter since intermolecular interactions are embedded in phenomenological scalar chi-parameters in the spirit of Flory–Huggins theory.27 However, in reality, clustering and microdomain formation are initiated locally by the short-range attraction. As is well known in liquid state theory (e.g., classic van der Waals fluid and related ideas),54,65 an attraction of given strength induces a variable amount of local clustering depending on how rapidly the potential varies in space, i.e., the range of associated force. Generally, clustering is enhanced as the range of attraction is decreased. This physics is captured in the full PRISM theory and is also present to

some lesser degree in compressible PRISM-RPA although it is not self-consistently treated. The exponential attraction form of the sticker–sticker attraction [Eq. (1)] allows us to tune the range by changing the parameter α. A smaller value of α produces a shorter-range attraction. Figure 10(a) shows the theory phase boundaries for α = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7;
recall that α = 0.5 corresponds to the baseline model discussed above [Fig. 4(a)]. There are again (as discussed above) “bumps” in the numerical PRISM theory data around the intersection between MaPS spinodal and crossover to a microemulsion, which also causes
the “dent” in k ∗ as a function of φ [Fig. 10(b)]. This is likely due to the approximate extrapolation procedure employed to determine the crossover. As the range of interaction decreases (smaller α), the system macrophase separates at a lower temperature, i.e., the MaPS spinodal shifts downward. This is the expected result for a k = 0 liquid–liquid demixing transition. Quantitatively, the MaPS critical temperature is Tc ≈ 0.54 for α = 0.3, Tc ≈ 1.98 for α = 0.5, and
Tc ≈ 4.56 for α = 0.7. Inspection of the results shows that Tc(α) is a function of the range parameter that increases more rapidly than a linear relationship (see Appendix Fig. 13), which reflects the influence of nonrandom interchain pair correlations absent in a literal mean field theory. For comparison, Tc as a function of α from the
PRISM-RPA calculation is shown in Appendix Fig. 13. PRISM-RPA theory always predicts higher values of Tc than the full PRISM calculation. This is the physically expected trend since the former theory lacks the nonrandom self-consistently determined correlation or clustering effects that can stabilize the homogeneous phase. To explore the shape of phase boundaries, we normalize temperature by the MaPS critical temperature, Tc (maximum along the MaPS spinodal). We find that the MaPS spinodals collapse onto a master curve for different values of α, suggesting that macrophase separation is insensitive to the range of interaction beyond the effect of renormalizing the temperature scale. On the other hand, the normalized crossover to the microemulsion state shifts upward with decrease in α, suggesting a higher tendency to form a microemulsion as the attraction range decreases, consistent with classic liquid state physics ideas. Figure 10(b) shows the corresponding results for the ordering
wavevector k ∗ at the phase boundary, εB∗B. The non-monotonic vari
ation of k ∗ with εB∗B is consistent with the non-monotonic behavior of the microemulsion crossover boundary (this trend may be subtle and could be affected by the extrapolation procedure we employed). Figure 10(b) shows that shorter-range attraction leads to a larger ordering wavevector [Fig. 10(b)], i.e., a smaller microdomain length,

which is physically intuitive. Furthermore, Figs. 10(a) and 10(b) demonstrates that decreasing the attraction range leads to a smaller gap between Tc and TL, where (φL, TL) is the Lifshitz-like point described in Fig. 4(a). Our result suggests that shorter-range attraction hinders the propensity of a conventional LLPS [phase regime II in Fig. 4(a)] and promotes the ability to form a mesostructured liquid either as a one phase microemulsion-like state or in the dense phase of a system that has underwent demixing into two phases. This trend is consistent with the physical discussion above that a shorter-range attraction promotes stronger local clustering, which drives the larger length scale microphase-like or microemulsion behavior and suppresses macrophase separation. We note that such behavior is reminiscent of what is observed for colloid, nanoparticle, fullerene, and patchy globular protein solutions that interact via strong short-range attractions where the fluid–fluid critical point disappears, becoming submerged in a fluid–solid coexistence region when the range of attraction is sufficiently reduced.70–74 We also have performed PRISM-RPA theory calculations for different ranges of the attractive interaction between sticker (B) monomers. Figures 10(c) and 10(d) show the phase behavior and ordering wavevector as a function of φ. Figures 10(a) and 10(b) show that PRISM-RPA theory performs poorly for short-range attractions compared to the full PRISM results, in the direction of greatly underestimating the crossover temperature. This again is consistent with the physical discussion at the beginning of this subsection, i.e., shorter-range attraction induces larger local clustering, which is not properly captured by the RPA approximation. Figure 10(d) shows
that the ordering wavevector k ∗ increases as the range of interaction decreases, consistent with the full PRISM theory prediction.
However, PRISM-RPA theory predicts that k ∗ is continuous in φ regardless of the value of α, which seems to be inconsistent with
full PRISM theory, which shows discontinuous changes of k ∗ for α = 0.3, 0.5.
B. Effect of spacer–spacer interaction
So far, we have studied an asymmetric interaction model in which only the B–B interaction is attractive and the AA and AB
interactions are purely repulsive. In a compressible liquid with strong correlations, it is a priori unclear if the results for longer wavelength structure and fluctuations will be qualitatively the same if this attraction model is changed. Hence, we ask how the inclusion of spacer–spacer attractive interactions affects the phase behavior by introducing an A–A exponential attraction with εAA = εBB = ε, but leaving the AB interaction to be purely hardcore. This model is now symmetric with regard to attractive interactions between like species. Note that this is not of a classic “sticker–spacer” form, and this choice is expected to enhance clustering and promote more local separation of A and B monomers compared to the baseline choice of potential employed above. Our first finding is that the basic structure of the phase behavior is not affected by the above change of the potential model. There still exists a MaPS spinodal at low to intermediate polymer packing fraction and a crossover to a microemulsion-like state for higher packing fraction [Fig. 11(a)]. For the symmetric attraction model, the Lifshitz-like point shifts to significantly higher packing fractions φ = 0.4 compared to asymmetric model value of φ = 0.24. This corresponds to a suppression (enhancement) of the domain of microemulsion stabilization (macrophase separation). Surprisingly, the behavior of the low wavevector structure factors near the intersection between the two transition boundaries is qualitatively different from the asymmetric interaction counterpart. Figure 11(b) shows the evolution of the partial B–B structural factors as a function of βεBB near the Lifshitz-like point at φ = 0.38. The simultane
ous presence of k = 0 upturn and a finite low wavevector peak is observed, a classic Lifshitz-like feature in mean field models. By contrast, there is always only a single peak in the structure factor either at k = 0 or a finite wavevector at all values of βεBB for the asymmet
ric interaction case. To the left of the Lifshitz-like point, for 0.38 > φ > 0.32, two peaks are present but eventually the zero wavevector peak grows faster and hence a MaPS spinodal emerges. To the right of the Lifshitz-like point, for 0.38 < φ < 0.42, the finite wavevector peak grows faster, and hence a crossover to microemulsion occurs. In addition, the total density–density fluctuation structure factors around the Lifshitz-like point behave very differently between

symmetric and asymmetric interaction models. For the asymmetric interaction model, the total structure factor has a significant low wavevector peak around the Lifshitz-like point. In contrast, for the symmetric interaction model it has no such peak. This is because the partial cross A–B collective static structure factor is negative at low wavevectors for the symmetric model, which tends to cancel the positive A–A/B–B structure factors at low wavevector, whereas it is positive in the asymmetric model. We reason this behavior is a consequence of at least two physical effects: The symmetric interaction model has (1) a stronger thermodynamic driving force to minimize unfavorable contacts between A and B monomers and (2) a higher volume fraction of the Lifshitz-like point implying the liquid is less compressible. We have also performed PRISM-RPA theory calculations for the symmetric interaction model and found it produces qualitatively the same phase behavior as the full PRISM theory results discussed above. The MaPS and MiPS spinodals predicted by PRISM-RPA theory are shown in Fig. 11(a) as well their comparison with the analogous full PRISM theory result. As expected for such a “mean field” type theory, the critical temperature predicted by PRISM-RPA is higher than that of the full PRISM theory, leading to a higher MaPS envelope. In contrast, the MiPS spinodal predicted by PRISM-RPA theory quantitatively resembles the crossover boundary from full PRISM theory and the location of Lifshitz point predicted is similar to that found in the full PRISM analysis. Further work is required to fully understand the role of chemical specificity as encoded in nature of intermolecular attractive interactions, which we believe is best done in the context of applications of the theory developed in this article to specific biomolecular or synthetic copolymer systems.
C. PRISM theory can differentiate sequences
As a proof of concept, we perform a few additional PRISM theory calculations for different sticker–spacer sequences (both ordered and aperiodic) to demonstrate the natural ability of this approach to make predictions for different sequences. The asymmetric interaction model is adopted, i.e., spacer–spacer and sticker–spacer interactions are purely hard core repulsion and sticker–sticker interactions are attractive. Figure 12 shows the phase boundaries and the ordering wavevector for five sequences indicated in the figure, including an ordered diblock (green markers) and a triblock (red markers) system. All the sequences have the same composition, i.e., the fraction of stickers is fB = 0.6. Figure 12(a) shows that the dilute branch of the macrophase separation boundary is insensitive to the exact sequence. We surmise that the dilute branch is largely determined by the fraction of stickers rather than the sequence. In contrast, the more interesting onset of the crossover to microemulsion and the shape of the crossover boundary is sensitive to the sequence. Note that for the diblock copolymer (green marker), the finite ordering wavevector onset is at the lowest volume fraction investigated φ = 0.001 [Fig. 12(b)]. This indicates an absence of a MaPS spinodal, suggesting that this specific diblock copolymer does not have macroscopic phase separation at any value of φ and εBB. The full PRISM theory prediction for this diblock system is consistent with the simulation studies in Ref. 50 where it is found to only form finite aggregates and is also consistent with literature that find block

Figure 12(b) also shows that the precise value of k ∗ is sequence specific, which we believe is mainly controlled by the degree of blockiness of the sequence. Indeed, for the diblock copolymer with highest blockiness, its value of k∗ at φ > 0.3 is lowest among all the sequences. We note that such blockiness can be characterized by the so-called “sequence charge decoration” (SCD) metric originally developed to capture sequence effects in polyelectrolytes,77 but it can be extended to characterize the blockiness of A/B copolymers.51 Application of such analysis tools will be pursued in future work. In summary, Fig. 12 shows that the overall phase behavior of the system is sequence-dependent. Much further work needs to be

done to dissect the role of sequence in shaping the phase behavior and longer wavelength collective structure.
VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS
We have applied PRISM integral equation theory to study the phase behavior and longer wavelength structure of model biomolecular condensates as crudely represented by aperiodic AB copolymers. The model employed can be viewed as either a sticker–spacer model or a hydrophobic/hydrophilic model, in which the interactions among the sites are characterized by their strength and range. We show that the phase behavior of such a system consists of macroscopic phase separation (MaPS) and crossover to a highly fluctuating or correlated microemulsion-like state, with a rich interplay between them. The latter has strong implications for the propensity of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). The difference in transition temperature and volume fraction between the MaPS and the microemulsion crossover regions quantifies the window to form structureless liquid-like polymer-rich phases through MaPS (LLPS). The theoretical results also imply that at low temperature or high sticker–sticker attraction strength, the system macrophase separates into a polymer-rich and mesoscopically structured dense phase. This phase is likely characterized as a microemulsion. Possible true longrange order may exist at a higher volume fraction or with high enough sticker–sticker interaction though this cannot be a priori predicted by liquid state theory alone. However, due to the nonperiodic nature of the sequence of real proteins and their relatively short length, the existence of such long-range ordering is not guaranteed. In general, our theory predicts that there is a window in the temperature–concentration phase space where the system undergoes a transition to a dilute and a dense phase, and the dense phase cannot be characterized as a structurally homogeneous liquid but rather as a mesoscopically structured microemulsion. We speculate that the mesh-like structure observed experimentally for Sup35 condensates may be a microemulsion.12
It is important to bear in mind the limitations of the current study. The copolymer model employed aims to model biomolecules that are fully flexible along their backbone and can be characterized by two types of interaction sites. In principle, it is possible to extend the model to incorporate a folded domain and more types of interaction sites. If the fraction of sticky interaction sites is reduced to of order 1%–10%, the employed copolymer model can be viewed as an associative polymer17 where physical gelation is an important emergent phenomenon, which is distinct from the studied equilibrium microemulsion state. The microemulsion is characterized by an emergent mesoscopic ordering length scale while gelation need not be. Of course, the physical clustering of sticky monomers that drives the formation of a microemulsion can also trigger a nonequilibrium gel state if the lifetime of the sticky bonds and domains becomes sufficiently long compared to experimental timescales. Moreover, recent simulation studies have elucidated the impact of weak, nonspecific cross A–B attractions on the macroscopic phase separation process, particularly when the fraction of stickers is small.78 A comprehensive understanding of how the sticker fraction influences phase behavior requires future computational studies and detailed analysis. However, in Fig. 11 we did provide an example that shows that the phase behavior is sensitive to the particular choice of sticker–sticker and spacer–spacer interactions. We believe the major enlargement of parameter space to study models with more attraction interactions (and hence potential parameters) is likely best pursued in the context of applications to specific biopolymer systems. Micellization is another scenario that may be relevant to condensate formation, as demonstrated by the recent experiment on IDP-based synthetic polymer solution.79 The micellization process cannot be directly inferred through the structure factors we have determined but require additional analysis. Moreover, micellization and any associated fluctuating microphase separation is typically relevant for systems with much lower fraction of stickers than the high value (60%) we have studied. PRISM theory can be applied to such low sticker fractions (e.g., 5%–15%), and this is a future direction of interest. The influence of chain length on phase behavior has not been explored in our study. For irregular sequences, it is not possible to alter molecular length without concurrently impacting its sequence. As such, the effects of chain length are intrinsically intertwined with sequence. However, based on general polymer physics ideas, we expect that maintaining a fixed sticker fraction and sequence blockiness while increasing the chain length will likely enhance the propensity for macroscopic phase separation (MaPS), thus broadening the MaPS window. In contrast, we expect the microemulsion crossover boundary may be less affected since the associated clustering effect is controlled to leading order by the degree of blockiness of the sequence and not the overall chain length. Several specific questions remain unanswered at present. First, more quantitative analysis of sequence effects on the phase behavior and long wavelength structure is warranted. This is important to understand how the mutation of the sequence affects condensate formation. Second, a detailed study of the local structural correlations as embedded in the real space pair correlation functions, including local cluster numbers or nearest neighbor analysis, would be interesting to carry out. Finally, the formation of a microemulsion structure or strong clustering between the stickers is expected

APPENDIX A: SIMULATIONS
For the reasons explained in the main text, we model the biomolecular condensate system as an A/B copolymer solution with A (B) type of monomer representing the spacer (sticker). The energy function for a single A/B copolymer chain in our simulation is
U = ∑US + ∑UAA + ∑UBB + ∑UAB.
For the chain connectivity bond potential, US, we use the harmonic potential given by
US = K(r − l0)2,
where r is the distance between the two connected monomers, K = 300 is the spring constant, and l0 = 4/3 is the equilibrium bond length. The sticker–sticker (B–B) interaction is given by the LennardJones potential,
UBB = 4εBB[( σ

where εBB is the attraction strength and σ is the monomer size. The sticker–spacer (A–B) or spacer–spacer (A–A) interactions are modeled as purely repulsive Weeks–Chandler–Anderson (WCA) potential,
UAB or UAA = 4εBB[( σ

] + εBB , for r < 21/6σ,
and UAB or UAA = 0 for r ≥ 21/6σ. For all pair interactions, σ = 1. All values are in reduced units. We have performed low-friction Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations to simulate the equilibrium properties of the system. The equation of motion for a monomer is given by
md2r/ dt2 = F − ζ dr/ dt + R,
where ζ is the friction coefficient, F is the force experienced by each monomer, and R is the random force satisfying the fluctuation–dissipation theorem ⟨R⟩ = 0 and ⟨R i(t)R j(t′) >= 6kBTζδ(t − t′)δi j. The LD simulations are performed using the Molecular Dynamics software LAMMPS in which the equations of motion are integrated using the velocity-Verlet algorithm. Without loss of generality, we set m = 1 and ζ = 0.01. The low value of friction coefficient allows efficient sampling of configuration space. The center of the mass of the whole system is set to be at the origin after each time step to prevent overall translation of the condensed phase. The simulation box is orthogonal and has periodic boundary conditions. The length along the z-dimension is three times the length along x- and y-dimensions, with the values varying accordingly to achieve the desired target volume fraction/number density. The short side has a length L, computed as L = σ(πMN/18φ)1/3
where M = 2000 is the total number of polymer chains and N = 20 is the chain length, φ is the targeted total packing fraction. Note we set the volume of a single monomer to be (4/3)π(σ/2)3. Initially, the simulation box is set to be cubic with side length L, and the individual polymer chains are randomly inserted into the box. Because some polymer chains overlap due to random insertion, LD simulations are performed with a small time step Δt = 0.001 for 105 time steps to relax the system to minimize chain overlap. Subsequently, the system is simulated with Δt = 0.01 for 107 time steps. Then, the box is expanded gradually along the z-dimension. The z-dimension side is incremented at a constant rate by ΔL such that it increases to 3L after 107 time steps. Then, the system is further simulated for 108 time steps, and the second half of this simulation portion is used in the analysis.
