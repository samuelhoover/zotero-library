Abstract - Water-soluble nonstoichiometria poly
elestrolyte complexes (NPEC) are formed as a result
of interaction of opposite charged polyelectrolytes
used in nonequivalent ratios. One of the most
important properties of NPEC is their ability to
participate in intermacromoleeular exchange and
substitution reactions in aqueous solutions. The
kinetics of exchange and substitution reactions
has been studied by the method of luminescenee
quenohing. It has been found that such reactions
proceed by the contact mechanism and that addition
of low molecular electrolytes to the reaotion
mixtures results in a dramatic increase in the
rates of the reactions. The kinetics of the
reactions is well described by the equation
q = l-exp(-ktq (here q is the degree of conversion
and d. c l ) , deduced under the assumption that
exchange and substitution occur by the nucleation
mechanism and the development of nuclei is inhi
bited in time. The studied reactions represent
a new class of interpolymer reactions and they
can be very important, in particular, for under
standing the mechanism of functioning of biologi
cally important macromolecules and for the
interpretation of the physiological activity of
polyelectrolytes .
INTRODUCTION
It is known that interpolgelectrolyte complexes (PEC) are
formed when solutions of opposite charged polyelectrolytes
are mixed. Complementary chains are retained within PEC
electrostatically by a cooperative system of intermolecular
ion bonds /1-4/. It is precisely the cooperative character
of interactions of polyions forming PEC that causes high
stability of these macromolecular oompounds within the
certain range of cha es in the conditions (pH, ionic
8trength, temperaturz.
Nonstoichiometric polyelectrolyte complexes (NPEC) are of
special interest. They are obtained at the interaction of
polyions with different degrees of polymerization, P. The
polyions are introduced into the reaction in nonequivalent
ratios, so that a relatively long chained host polyelectro
lyte (HPE) is incorporated in an NPEC particle in some

tation peaks: a slow one (I), its sedimentation coefficient
corresponds to free NaPMA and a fast one (11) characterized
by a high value of the sedimentation coefficient. The latter
peak can be detected only at a lower velocity of rotor
rotation (20 000r.p.m. in comparison to the conventional
velocity of 56 000r.p.m.). It corresponds to newly formed
PEC partiales. Practically, this PEC incorporates all amounts
of the added KPVS and PEVP and a negligible amount of NaPMA,
practically almost all amount of the latter is found in a
slowly sedimenting fraction. This conclusion is drawn from
the analysis of the fractions I and I1 compositions, carried
out with a scanning ultracentrifuge, using samples of
labelled NaF'MA. Taking into account the high value of
fraction I1 sedimentation coefficient and considerably
higher specific viscosity of the reaction mixture, in com
parison with that of the initial solutions, we can conclude
that a newly formed stoichiometrio PEC(PVS-PEVP) is isolated
in the form of highly dispersive colloidal phase. The colloi
dal system is stabilized by NaPMA polyanions adsorbed on the
surface of stoiehiometric PEC particles.

thus promote a decrease in the distances between polyions
forming intermediate ternary complexes shown in scheme (8).
One aan also suppose that a screening low molecular electro
lyte also facilitates substitution of some intermoleeular
oontaots by others, i.e. the second stage of exchange and
substitution reactions.
The data considered explain the necessity of simple salt
addition to systems in which NPEC are synthesized by direct
mixing of ionized HPE and GPE. In the absence of simple
Balts the attempts to prepare NPEC by direct mixing polymer
components fail /12/. It is due to local supersaturations

causing the appearance of nonequilibrated insoluble taomplex
particles with the composition considerably different from
that of the reaction mixture. The life time of these in
soluble PECs, which incorporate too aany GPE chains, is very
due to low rates of exchange reactions in salt-free
kza.
The attempts to treat the experimental kinetic curves in the
terms of first and second order reactions do not lead to any
positive results. Kinetie curves, for example, for extahange
reactions (2') cannot be straightened in the terms of the
corresponding linear anamorphoses. At the same time they
satisfy well the equation:
q = 1 - exp(-kt&)
(q is the degree of conversion,dGl) deduced under the
assumption that relaxation (in a given case exchange and
substitution) oeaurs by the nucleation meehanism and growing
of nuclei is inhibited in time /2l/. Fi .13 represent
kinetic curves for exchange reaction ( 2 7 in the eoordinatee

CONCLUSION
,Thereactions studied represent a new class o f interpolymer
reactions. They can be very important, in particular, for
understanding the mechanism of functioning of biologically
important macromolecules and for the interpretation of the
physiological activity of polyelectrolytes.
