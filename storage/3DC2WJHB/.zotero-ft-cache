Whitesides' Group: Writing a Paper**
By George M. Whitesides*
1. What is a Scientific Paper?
A paper is an organized description of hypotheses, data and conclusions, intended to instruct the reader. Papers are a central part of research. If your research does not generate papers, it might just as well not have been done. aInteresting and unpublishedo is equivalent to anon-existento. Realize that your objective in research is to formulate and test hypotheses, to draw conclusions from these tests, and to teach these conclusions to others. Your objective is not to acollect datao. A paper is not just an archival device for storing a completed research program; it is also a structure for planning your research in progress. If you clearly understand the purpose and form of a paper, it can be immensely useful to you in organizing and conducting your research. A good outline for the paper is also a good plan for the research program. You should write and rewrite these plans/outlines throughout the course of the research. At the beginning, you will have mostly plan; at the end, mostly outline. The continuous effort to understand, analyze, summarize, and reformulate hypotheses on paper will be immensely more efficient for you than a process in which you collect data and only start to organize them when their collection is acompleteo.
2. Outlines
2.1. The Reason for Outlines
I emphasize the central place of an outline in writing papers, preparing seminars, and planning research. I especially believe that for you, and for me, it is most efficient to write papers from outlines. An outline is a written plan of the organization of a paper, including the data on which it rests. You should, in fact, think of an outline as a carefully organized and presented set of data, with attendant objectives, hypotheses, and conclusions, rather than an outline of text. An outline itself contains little text. If you and I can agree on the details of the outline (that is, on the data and organization), the supporting text can be assembled fairly easily. If we
do not agree on the outline, any text is useless. Much of the time in writing a paper goes into the text; most of the thought goes into the organization of the data and into the analysis. It can be relatively efficient in time to go through several (even many) cycles of an outline before beginning to write text; writing many versions of the full text of a paper is slow. All writing that I doÐpapers, reports, proposals (and, of course, slides for seminars)ÐI do from outlines. I urge you to learn how to use them as well.
2.2. HowShould You Construct an Outline?
The classical approach is to start with a blank piece of paper, and write down, in any order, all important ideas that occur to you concerning the paper. Ask yourself the obvious questions: aWhy did I do this work?o; aWhat does it mean?o; aWhat hypotheses did I mean to test?o; aWhat ones did I actually test?o; aWhat were the results? Did the work yield a new method of compound? What?o; aWhat measurements did I make?o; aWhat compounds? How were they characterized?o. Sketch possible equations, figures, and schemes. It is essential to try to get the major ideas. If you start the research to test one hypothesis, and decide, when you see what you have, that the data really seem to test some other hypothesis better, don't worry. Write them both down, and pick the best combinations of hypotheses, objectives, and data. Often the objectives of a paper when it is finished are different from those used to justify starting the work. Much of good science is opportunistic and revisionist. When you have written down what you can, start with another piece of paper and try to organize the jumble of the first one. Sort all of your ideas into three major heaps (1±3).
1. Introduction
Why did I do the work? What were the central motivations and hypotheses?
2. Results and Discussion
What were the results? How were compounds made and characterized? What was measured?
3. Conclusions
What does it all mean? What hypotheses were proved or disproved? What did I learn? Why does it make a difference?

Next, take each of these sections, and organize it on yet finer scale. Concentrate on organizing the data. Construct figures, tables, and schemes to present the data as clearly and compactly as possible. This process can be slowÐI may sketch a figure five to ten times in different ways trying to decide how it is most clear (and looks best aesthetically). Finally, put everythingÐoutline of sections, tables, sketches of figures, equationsÐin good order. When you are satisfied that you have included all the data (or that you know what additional data you intend to collect), and have a plausible organization, give the outline to me. Simply indicate where missing data will go, how you think (hypothesize) they will look, and how you will interpret them if your hypothesis is correct. I will take this outline, add my opinions, suggest changes, and return it to you. It usually takes four to five iterations (often with additional experiments) to agree on an outline. When we have agreed, the data are usually in (or close to) final form (that is, the tables, figures, etc., in the outline will be the tables, figures,... in the paper). You can then start writing, with some assurance that much of your prose will be used. The key to efficient use of your and my time is that we start exchanging outlines and proposals as early in a project as possible. Do not, under anycircumstances, wait until the collection of data is acompleteo before starting to write an outline. No project is ever complete, and it saves enormous effort and much time to propose a plausible paper and outline as soon as you see the basic structure of a project. Even if we decide to do significant additional work before seriously organizing a paper, the effort of writing an outline will have helped to guide the research.
2.3. The Outline
What an outline should contain:
1. Title
2. Authors
3. Abstract
Do not write an abstract. That can be done when the paper is complete.
4. Introduction
The first paragraph or two should be written out completely. Pay particular attention to the opening sentence. Ideally, it should state concisely the objective of the work, and indicate why this objective is important. In general, the Introduction should have these elements: d The objectives of the work.
d The justification for these objectives: Why is the work important? d Background: Who else has done what? How? What have we done previously? d Guidance to the reader: What should the reader watch for in the paper? What are the interesting high points? What strategy did we use? d Summary/conclusion: What should the reader expect as conclusion? In advanced versions of the outline, you should also include all the sections that will go in the Experimental section (at the level of paragraph subheadings) and indicate what information will go in the Microfilm section.
5. Results and Discussion
The results and discussion are usually combined. This section should be organized according to major topics. The separate parts should have subheadings in boldface to make this organization clear, and to help the reader scan through the final text to find the parts of interest. The following list includes examples of phrases that might plausibly serve as section headings: d Synthesis of Alkane Thiols d Characterization of Monolayers d Absolute Configuration of the Vicinal Diol Unit d Hysteresis Correlates with Roughness of the Surface d Dependence of the Rate Constant on Temperature d The Rate of Self-Exchange Decreases with the Polarity of the Solvent Try to make these section headings as specific and information-rich as possible. For example, the phrase aThe Rate of Self-Exchange Decreases with The Polarity of The Solvento is obviously longer than aMeasurement of Rateso, but much more useful to the reader. In general, try to cover the major common points: d Synthesis of starting materials d Characterization of products d Methods of characterization d Methods of measurement d Results (rate constants, contact angles, whatever) In the outline, do not write any significant amount of text, but get all the data in their proper place: Any text should simply indicate what will go in that section. d Section Headings d Figures (with captions) d Schemes (with captions and footnotes) d Equations d Tables (correctly formatted) Remember to think of a paper as a collection of experimental results, summarized as clearly and economically as possible in figures, tables, equations, and schemes. The text in the paper serves just to explain the data, and is secondary. The more information can be compressed into tables, equations, etc., the shorter and more readable the paper will be.

6. Conclusions
In the outline, summarize the conclusions of the paper as a list of short phrases or sentences. Do not repeat what is in the Results section, unless special emphasis is needed. The Conclusions section should be just that, and not a summary. It should add a new, higher level of analysis, and should indicate explicitly the significance of the work.
7. Experimental
Include, in the correct order to correspond to the order in the Results section, all of the paragraph subheadings of the Experimental section.
2.4. In Summary
d Start writing possible outlines for papers early in a project. Do not wait until the aendo. The end may never come. d Organize the outline and the paper around easily assimilated dataÐtables, equations, figures, schemesÐrather than around text. d Organize in order of importance, not in chronological order. An important detail in writing papers concerns the weight to be given to topics. Neophytes often organize a paper in terms of chronology: that is, they give a recitation of their experimental program, starting with their cherished initial failures and leading up to a climactic successful finale. This approach is completelywrong . Start with the most important results, and put the secondary results later, if at all. The reader usually does not care how you arrived at your big results, only what they are. Shorter papers are easier to read than longer ones.
3. Some Points of Style
d Do not use nouns as adjectives: Not:
ATP formation; reaction product But:
formation of ATP; product of the reaction
d The word athiso must always be followed by a noun, so that its reference is explicit. Not:
This is a fast reaction; This leads us to conclude But:
This reaction is fast; This observation leads us to conclude d Describe experimental results uniformly in the past tense. Not:
Addition of water gives product. But:
Addition of water gave product. d Use the active voice whenever possible. Not:
It was observed that the solution turned red. But:
The solution turned red. or We observed that the solution turned red. d Complete all comparisons. Not:
The yield was higher using bromine. But:
The yield was higher using bromine than chlorine. d Type all papers double-spaced (not single- or one-and-ahalf-spaced), and leave two spaces after colons, and after periods at the end of sentences. Leave generous margins. Assume that we will write all papers using the style of the American Chemical Society. You can get a good idea of this style from three sources: d The journals. Simply look at articles in the journals and copy the organization you see there.
d Previous papers from the group. By looking at previous papers, you can see exactly how a paper should alooko. If what you wrote looks different, it probably is not what we want.
d The ACS Handbook for Authors. Useful, detailed, especially the section on references, pp. 173±229. I also suggest you read Strunk and White, The Elements of Style (Macmillan: New York, 1979, 3rd ed.) to get a sense for usage. A number of other books on scientific writing are in the group library; these books all contain useful advice, but are not lively reading. There are also several excellent books on the design of graphs and figures.
