The mechanical properties of irradiated single-layer graphene sheets are determined as a function of inserted vacancy concentration. We find that the vacancy-induced crystalline-to-amorphous transition is accompanied by a brittle-to-ductile transition in the failure response of irradiated graphene sheets for inserted vacancy concentrations of 8%–12%. While point defects and larger voids appreciably degrade the strength of pristine graphene, we find that even heavily damaged samples (20% vacancies) exhibit tensile strengths of 30 GPa, in significant excess of those typical of engineering materials. Our results suggest that defect engineering of graphene is feasible without incurring a complete loss of its desirable mechanical properties. CV 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

Lattice defects in graphene have been studied extensively as a route towards controlling the electronic, chemical, and mechanical properties of this material. Ion- and electronbeam irradiation have been used to introduce vacancies, nonhexagonal rings (agglomerated and reconstructed vacancies), and larger holes or voids in graphene.1–3 Experiments have shown that the sustained introduction of vacancies in graphene at carefully controlled electron energies can lead to the evolution of a two-dimensional (2D) amorphous sp2hybridized sheet of carbon consisting of random patches of polygons surrounding holes (2D voids).3 Such defective graphene monolayers could serve as templates for further chemical functionalization or decoration with metal atoms and nanoparticles.1,3,4 The influence of defects (e.g., vacancies, cracks, grain boundaries, and triple junctions) on the intrinsic mechanical properties of graphene has been studied quite extensively through both computation and experiment.5–15 Pristine, single-crystal graphene, exhibits exceptional mechanical properties, possessing an intrinsic strength of 130 GPa and stiffness of nearly 1 TPa.6,16 The presence of grain boundaries in polycrystalline samples has been shown to substantially compromise the intrinsic strength of graphene, typically by an order of magnitude for a random patchwork of grains.10 Similarly, vacancy defects have been shown to cause a substantial decrease in the intrinsic strength of graphene, with even a small fraction of defects (<0:5%) leading to a decrease in the tensile strength by 20%–30%.11,14 This process typically occurs via void formation due to vacancy aggregation, followed by void-linking and eventual failure.14 Previous studies have only focused on dilute distributions of vacancies in graphene ( 5%).11,14 In contrast, the extent of damage induced in the amorphization experiments3 is significantly higher, and the mechanical response of such heavily damaged graphene sheets is as yet unexplored. In recent computational work, we studied the effect of vacancy insertion due to irradiation on the morphological,
structural, and electronic properties of single-layer graphene.17 We established the onset of a crystalline-to-amorphous phase transition in the range of vacancy concentration from 5% to 10%. The defective graphene monolayers exhibited increasing metallicity upon vacancy insertion due to the introduction of dangling-bond states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. We also found the structure of the amorphized graphene generated by our computer simulations17 to be in excellent agreement with that of amorphous graphene prepared by high-energy (100 keV) electron irradiation.3 In this Letter, we investigate in detail the mechanical behavior of these model irradiated single-layer graphene sheets. Specifically, we examine the evolution of key mechanical properties such as the tensile strength, toughness, and failure strain as a function of inserted vacancy concentration, and, additionally, the evolution of the corresponding fracture responses (brittle vs. ductile). We show that while pristine graphene undergoes a substantial decrease in its tensile strength with even a small concentration of vacancies, the subsequent decrease in tensile strength with increasing defect concentration is more gradual: heavily damaged graphene sheets (20% vacancies) retain nearly 30% of their ideal (defect-free) tensile strength. We identify a qualitative change in the failure behavior from brittle to ductile in the range of 8%–10% vacancy concentration, which is within the range over which the crystalline-to-amorphous transition occurs. Increased ductility of the damaged graphene sheets is also clearly evidenced from the monotonic increase in failure strains, and the damaged samples are seen to retain their toughness over the wide range of vacancy concentrations examined here. We studied the mechanical behavior of irradiated graphene sheets by performing molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of uniaxial deformation tests. Our MD simulations were performed using the adaptive interatomic reactive empirical bond-order (AIREBO) potential18 as implemented in the LAMMPS software package.19 We adjusted the smaller cutoff distance in the switching function for the AIREBO potential to 1.92 A ̊ , as is common practice,7,13 to avoid spurious post-hardening behavior. The graphene model used in the simulations was a 62:8 A ̊  60:5 A ̊ sheet containing 1500

atoms, which was subjected to periodic boundary conditions in the graphene plane. We refer the reader to our previous work17 for a description of the structural relaxation procedure for generating representative irradiated sheets with specific vacancy concentrations.20 Mechanical testing was performed on the defective graphene samples by subjecting them to uniaxial tensile strains along the armchair and zigzag directions until failure. The tests were conducted at an applied strain rate of 5  108=s within a canonical (NVT) ensemble at 300 K using a time-step of 1 fs. At each strain increment, the sheet was equilibrated for 0.5 ps prior to data collection; atomic stresses were obtained by averaging the virial stress every 500 MD time-steps over the subsequent 0.5 ps. The atomic stress was averaged over the entire sheet to produce a stress value for the current level of applied strain, which allowed us to sequentially construct the stressstrain curve; in this calculation, we assumed an effective sheet thickness of 3.34 A ̊ , which is equal to the graphitic interlayer spacing. Property calculations for each inserted vacancy concentration were performed by averaging over 10 trajectories with different random initial distributions of vacancies. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) display the stress-strain response of annealed, defective graphene sheets subjected to uniaxial strain along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
For the defect-free case (0%), we obtain a tensile strength and failure strain of 95 GPa and 17%, respectively, for loading along the armchair direction, with corresponding values of 110 GPa and 26% for loading along the zigzag direction.21 Upon introduction of 2% vacancy defects, which was the smallest concentration considered in this work, we see an appreciable drop in the tensile strength as well as in the failure strain of the graphene sheet. Unlike the pristine case (0%), which essentially requires homogeneous nucleation of defects prior to fracture, pre-existing point defects in the 2% case provide nucleation sites for cracks. The interaction between individual vacancies and their effect on crack propagation in graphene has been examined in earlier studies of the mechanical response of defective graphene with dilute and/or idealized, regular arrangements of vacancies.22,23 Near-neighbor vacancies can indeed coalesce upon tensile loading and nucleate a larger multivacancy; arrays of these multivacancies (and their reconstructed forms) act as precursors to larger cracks. As shown in Fig. 2(a), even in the realistic models of irradiated graphene with random vacancy distributions employed in the present study, aggregates of vacancies and multivacancies continue to act as sources for crack initiation. In particular, in the sequence of atomic configurations displayed in Fig. 2(a) for the 2% vacancy case, we observe that non-hexagonal carbon rings, such as 5-8-5 divacancy reconstructions [circled region in Fig. 2(a), frame 2], are localized regions of high stress concentration; such a high stress concentration is relieved by crack initiation. Similar results have been reported for pentagon-heptagon rings, which act as initiation sites for fracture at graphene grain boundaries.7,13,15 Continued loading of the sheet eventually leads to linking of a series of closely spaced voids [circled region in Fig. 2(a), frame 3], finally resulting in crack propagation and failure. Interestingly, in almost all of our simulations, we observe that the initial large drop in stress is not an indicator of complete failure—there are always a few monoatomic strands of carbon spanning the two nearly separated pieces of graphene; these strands persist for strain levels higher by a few more percentage points before final and complete failure of the sheet (Fig. 2). This is not an artifact of our simulation: such persistent atomic strands also have been seen to span grain boundaries in simulations of failure of polycrystalline graphene15,24 and, moreover, have been reported in quantum MD simulations of defective graphene bilayer nanoribbons.25 We also note that the failure behavior for the 2% case is essentially brittle in nature like the defect-free case, as there is abrupt and near complete failure (but for the few remaining monoatomic carbon chains) past the maximum of the stress-strain curve. With increasing inserted vacancy concentration, we observe a monotonic decrease in the tensile strength of graphene specimens [Figs. 1 and 3(a)], saturating at about 30 GPa for the range of concentrations considered here. There is also a distinct qualitative change in the stress-strain curves—the sharp and abrupt drop in stress past the maximum disappears with increasing vacancy concentration and is replaced by a more gradual softening until failure. The failure strains are depicted as a function of inserted vacancy concentration in Fig. 3(b), from which it is apparent that there is a direct and appreciable correlation between the vacancy concentration and the ductility

Initial vacancy concentrations expressed as percentages of lattice sites are indicated in the figure. With the exception of the defect-free case, all stress-strain curves were obtained by averaging over ten initial configurations and initial conditions (error bars are omitted here for clarity).

of the sample. From inspection of the stress-strain curves in Fig. 1, we find that this brittle-to-ductile transition in the failure response occurs in the range of vacancy concentrations from 8%–12%, which is nearly the same range of defect concentrations over which the crystalline-to-amorphous transition
occurs.17 The qualitative differences in the mechanical response at high defect concentrations can be visualized more clearly in the sequence of images in Fig. 2(b) for a graphene sheet containing 16% vacancy defects. Unlike the 2% vacancies case, for which stresses are clearly concentrated around nonhexagonal rings (reconstructed multi-vacancies), there are no obvious sites of stress concentration in the 16% vacancies case. At best, we can only identify elevated stresses in the chains of carbon atoms and graphene ligaments that span large voids in the graphene sheet. Fracture occurs as these ligaments unravel and gradually fail under tensile loading, leaving behind monoatomic chains, as before, which also eventually snap and result in complete failure of the sheet. The failure process by tearing and/or unraveling of ligaments that span voids in the highly defective sheets, such as that of Fig. 3(b), allows the irradiated graphene sheet to dissipate strain energy over a prolonged period of loading, thus leading to higher strain at failure (i.e., increased ductility). The total energy dissipated in the fracture process (i.e., the toughness) of various irradiated sheets can be quantified by integrating the total area under the stress-strain curve, which is shown in Fig. 3(c). The deleterious effect of even a small fraction of vacancy defects on the toughness of a graphene sheet is evident from these results. Nevertheless, apart from this significant initial decrease, the toughness remains fairly constant over the range of 2%–20% vacancy concentration. Thus, in spite of the significant structural damage exhibited by graphene sheets at large vacancy concentrations, there are still efficient dissipation mechanisms (such as unraveling of ligaments to form extended carbon chains) that delay the occurrence of fracture. For comparison, we mention that typical tensile strengths for metals are in the range from 0.1 to 1 GPa; in certain cases, heat treatment and/or mechanical processing can improve the strength to a few GPa.26 Non-metallic materials with noteworthy tensile strengths include single-crystal silicon, Si nanowires, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes

with tensile strengths of 7 GPa,27 5–12 GPa,28 and 10–60 GPa,29 respectively. Clearly, the irradiated graphene sheets studied here outperform most of these materials with respect to tensile strength. Overall, we conclude that while point defects and voids clearly compromise the strength of graphene monolayers, even the most heavily damaged, amorphous samples studied here are still remarkably strong in comparison with conventional engineering materials. In summary, we employed molecular-dynamics simulations to study the mechanical properties of irradiated singlelayer graphene generated by a vacancy insertion simulation model. We determined a critical range of vacancy concentrations that leads to a qualitative change in the fracture response from brittle to ductile, which correlates well with the onset of the defect-induced crystalline-to-amorphous transition in this material. Through uniaxial tensile tests, we quantified the tensile strength, ductility, and toughness of single-layer graphene as a function of inserted vacancy concentration. While there is undoubtedly an appreciable degradation in the load-carrying capacity of graphene due to point defects and voids, the damaged material still displays superior mechanical properties in relation to conventional engineering materials. It remains to be seen in future work to what extent these mechanical properties are further affected by chemical functionalization, which is the most obvious route for fine-tuning the electronic and optical properties of irradiated graphene.

Nevertheless, the initial vacancy concentration serves as a good indicator of the cumulative damage in the sheets prior to tensile tests. 21Note that, in the mechanical tests, we do not allow for relaxation in the direction orthogonal to the applied load, which results in slightly lower values for the tensile strength as compared to uniaxial stress tests; this has no bearing on our overall conclusions. 22R.
