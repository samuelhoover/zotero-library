Physical nanopatterning based on a precise control of macroscopic forcing is an essential tool of nanoscale science and technology. Using an externally applied electric field as the macroscopic force, we report here a computational study on the formation of surface nanopatterns consisting of single-layer homoepitaxial islands as a result of a morphological instability that can occur under edge electromigration conditions on the straight edge of a single-layer nanowire grown epitaxially on a crystalline substrate. Direct dynamical simulations based on a model that has been validated experimentally for the Ag/Ag system show that the current-induced nanowire edge instability causes the breakup of the nanowire and leads to the formation of uniformly distributed islands, arranged in linear or V-shaped arrays, which are uniformly sized with nanoscale dimensions. The simulation results are supported by linear stability theory and demonstrate that the geometrical features of the island patterns and the island sizes can be controlled precisely by controlling the electric field direction with respect to the nanowire axis and the electric field strength. Our findings have important implications for developing physical nanopatterning approaches toward enabling future nanofabrication technologies. Published by AIP Publishing.

An important tool for advancing nanoscale science and technology is the physical nanopatterning of material surfaces through precise control of macroscopic forces. Over the past decade, theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated the ability to protect surfaces and assemble surface features such as voids and epitaxial islands through atomic transport driven by macroscopic forces such as electric fields1–6 and thermal gradients.7 For example, under the action of an electric field, the resulting electromigration force drives atomic motion at the corresponding drift velocity, which can be expressed through the electromigration drift flux, the key ingredient in the phenomenological modeling of electricfield-driven atomic transport.1–4 This driven assembly is consistent with a paradigm that has been demonstrated for a broad class of material systems, including colloids8 and block copolymers.9,10 For single-layer surface features, edge diffusion is the dominant mode of atomic transport.11–13 Such single-layer island dynamics driven by edge electromigration was established experimentally for Ag islands on Ag{111} substrate surfaces,1 with the islands migrating in the direction of electron flow with speeds inversely proportional to their sizes.1 The directed assembly of single-layer surface features through atomic transport driven by external forcing offers a promising approach for physical nanopatterning.14 Nevertheless, the exploration of the driven assembly of such surface features for surface nanopatterning purposes has been limited. The purpose of this Letter is to report a surface nanopatterning approach by exploiting a current-induced instability undergone by the straight edge of a single-layer
homoepitaxial nanowire on a crystalline conducting substrate. Such a nanowire structure can be fabricated directly by epitaxial growth or driven evolution of large single-layer epitaxial islands;15 these nanowires are practically twodimensional (2D) surface features with length L and width w, such that L  w, with widths confined to nanoscale dimensions. Using linear stability theory (LST) and numerical simulations based on a fully nonlinear model of driven morphological evolution, we show that, under the action of an electric field, a morphological instability can be triggered on the nanowire’s edge and propagate through the nanowire causing its breakup. This post-instability dynamics leads to the formation of patterns, linear or V-shaped, of uniformly sized and distributed islands with dimensions of 10 nm; the island patterns and sizes can be controlled precisely through control of the electric field strength and direction. This nanopatterning strategy can be potentially adopted for lithography-free nanofabrication and physical patterning of surface features at dimensions that cannot be accessed by e-beam lithography. The epitaxial nanowire-shaped island is shown in Fig. 1 on the crystalline solid substrate surface that corresponds to

The currentdriven evolution of this nanowire is monitored by time stepping the continuity equation, according to which the normal velocity component, vn, at any point on the island edge is proportional to the edge divergence of the mass flux along the island edge, Js, with edge diffusion being the dominant mode of mass transport.11–13 For the size of the metallic islands and the temperature range considered in this study (several tens of degrees above room temperature), terrace diffusion and evaporation-condensation kinetics can be neglected.1,11–13 The applied electric field that drives island electromigration1–6 is aligned with the Cartesian x-axis and has strength E0.

The 2D nature of the single-layer nanowire renders non-local effects, such as current crowding, negligible and justifies the use of the local approximation Es 1⁄4 E0 cos h.4 Moreover, for the 2D homoepitaxial nanowires under consideration, elastic effects such as those of strain due to lattice mismatch that are accounted for in Ref. 16 can also be neglected.

In Eq. (2), x is the characteristic dimensionless rate of growth or decay of a perturbation with dimensionless wave number k and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to hE; a representative xðkÞ relation is plotted in Fig. 2(a). The maximally unstable wave number kmax corresponds to the maximum growth rate xðkmaxÞ > 0 that will dominate the driven post-instability evolution of the nanowire edge. Consequently, LST implies that, for the finite-width nanowires under consideration, growth of the nanowire straight edge perturbation at the dominant x(kmax), Fig. 2(b), will lead to formation of practically equal-size and equally spaced daughter islands due to necking and subsequent breakup of the narrow nanowire. The maximally unstable wavelength, kmax  2p=kmax, provides a length scale for the characteristic spacing of the daughter islands and, thus, for the characteristic daughter island size, d, with d2  kmaxw. For a nanowire aligned with the slowest edge diffusion direction, the dependence of kmax on hE for {110}, {100}, and {111} substrate surfaces is plotted in Fig. 2(c), showing that kmax decreases with increasing hE and attains a minimum value when the electric field is perpendicular to the nanowire straight edge, hE 1⁄4 90.

The LST is validated by comparisons of its predictions with the results of direct dynamical simulations using the front tracking technique of Refs. 16 and 20. In the simulations, the initial nanowire configurations are terminated at both ends with rounded (semi-circular) edges. Results from a representative simulation of nanowire breakup due to current-induced edge instability are shown in Figs. 2(d1)–2(d4). The instability originates at the ends of the nanowire, Fig. 2(d2), because of a strong thermodynamic driving force for atomic transport due to the nonzero curvature at the rounded nanowire ends. The propagation of the necking instability from both nanowire ends toward the nanowire center leads to nanowire breakup and the formation of daughter islands that are practically uniform in size and in distribution on the substrate surface, with the adjacent daughter islands being equidistant. Figure 2(d3) shows the daughter island pattern formed just before the electric field is turned off. Turning the electric field off causes the migration of the daughter islands on the substrate to stop and leads eventually to the thermodynamically stable configuration of Fig. 2(d4), which consists of a pattern of daughter islands with rounded morphology. Using our direct dynamical simulations, we explore systematically the various daughter island nanopatterns that may emerge as a result of the current-induced nanowire straight edge instability at a constant nanowire area, ANW. We use ANW 1⁄4 100pl2
E and vary the nanowire aspect ratio L/w, the substrate surface orientation, and the nanowire straight edge orientation, hE, focusing on two limiting cases of nanowire orientation on the substrate surface, namely, those with the nanowire axis parallel to the slowest and parallel to the fastest edge diffusion direction. Figure 3 shows the representative final stable patterns, after the electric field is turned off, of daughter islands
obtained from current-induced nanowire edge instability for nanowires with axes parallel to the slowest edge diffusion direction. Figures 3(a1), 3(b1), and 3(c1) show the initial nanowire configurations. Figures 3(a2)–3(a4), 3(b2)–3(b4), and 3(c2)–3(c4) depict the final stable daughter-island patterns on {110}, {100}, and {111} substrate surfaces, respectively. At hE values far from 90; 0 < hE  50 or  130
< hE < 180, the breakup of the nanowire into the daughter islands is initiated only at the leading edge of the nanowire and propagates toward its trailing end resulting in a pattern of small daughter islands distributed along a straight line (Figs. 3(a2)–3(a4)). At hE values not so far from 90;  50
< hE  130, the breakup of the nanowire into daughter islands is initiated at both ends of the nanowire and propagates toward the nanowire center. After breakup, both the daughter island and the parent island migrate in the direction of the applied electric field. Due to their smaller size, the daughter islands travel faster than the large-size nanowireshaped parent island; also, the daughter islands formed are of comparable size with each other and, hence, their migration speeds also are comparable resulting in daughter island positions along the migration direction that correspond to distances proportional to the time of migration from the formation of each individual daughter island. Such daughter island migration in conjunction with the sequential generation of daughter islands starting from both ends of the nanowire lead to the formation of a final “V-shaped” pattern of daughter islands distributed along two intersecting straight lines (Figs. 3(b2)–3(b4)), with a corner of angle b. The number of daughter islands and the inter-daughter-island spacing are generally different on the two different lines causing symmetry breaking, except for the special case of hE 1⁄4 90. At hE 1⁄4 90, the pattern obtained, similar to that of Fig. 2(d4), consists of equal-size daughter islands distributed uniformly along the two intersecting lines and arranged symmetrically with respect to the electric field direction (Figs. 3(c2)–3(c4)). In these patterns, only daughter islands originating at the nanowire edges and that at the nanowire center where the breakup cascade terminates deviate in size and spacing from the other daughter islands in the pattern, resulting in a symmetric V-shaped arrangement. The daughter island patterns obtained as a result of the current-induced nanowire edge instability for nanowire straight edges parallel to the fastest edge diffusion direction are presented in the supplementary material. These patterns are similar to those discussed above and shown in Fig. 3. The main qualitative difference between the two cases is that the stable current-assembled patterns for nanowire straight edges parallel to the fastest edge diffusion direction are obtained only for a certain range of hE around 90, namely, 45 < hE  135. Outside of this hE range, the post-instability island patterns that emerge are much more complex than those shown in Fig. 3 and in the supplementary material. The mean daughter-island diameter (d), the number of daughter islands (N), and the angle subtended between the two intersecting lines of daughter islands (b), of the patterns formed as a result of the current-induced nanowire edge instability for the {110}, {100}, and {111} substrate surfaces are summarized in the response diagrams of Fig. 4 as functions of the orientation angle hE for nanowire axes aligned

with the slowest edge diffusion direction. Such response diagrams for nanowires oriented along the fastest edge diffusion direction are presented in the supplementary material and exhibit similar trends with those of Fig. 4 over the range 45 < hE  135. It is evident from Fig. 4 that d(hE),
N(hE), and b(hE) are symmetric with respect to hE 1⁄4 90. Consistent with the LST implications, for given L/w and substrate surface orientation, the smallest daughter islands are obtained for electric fields perpendicular to the nanowire straight edge, hE 1⁄4 90. Consequently, N exhibits a maxi
mum at hE 1⁄4 90, also consistent with the LST implication that N  L=kmax. At high aspect ratios, L=w  100, nanowire breakup is triggered even at hE 1⁄4 0. The uniformity with varying hE in the mean daughter-island diameter and the number of daughter islands increases with increasing L/w. For given L/w, this pattern uniformity increases with increasing symmetry, m, of edge diffusional anisotropy.
Finally, we emphasize that d is proportional to lE (/ E1=2
0 ), which implies that the size and, thus, the number of daughter islands in the formed post-instability patterns can be controlled precisely by controlling the strength of the applied electric field. In summary, we presented an approach for surface nanopatterning based on a morphological instability undergone by the straight edge of a single-layer epitaxial nanowire on a crystalline substrate under the action of an externally applied electric field and demonstrated it for the Ag/Ag system. This current-induced instability causes nanowire breakup and the formation of patterns of uniformly sized and distributed islands, with nanoscale dimensions, organized in linear or
V-shaped arrangements. The island dimensions and the island pattern geometrical features can be designed precisely by controlling the strength of the electric field and its direction with respect to the nanowire axis. Our analysis can be extended to study the stability of heteroepitaxial nanowires with proper modifications in the expressions for the edge diffusivity and the edge stiffness to account for the effects of strain due to lattice mismatch.16 Our approach can be used to fabricate more complex and dense nanostructure arrays by starting with an aligned array of parallel nanowires.15,21 Our findings can be used to provide both experimentally testable hypotheses and design tools for surface nanopatterning over a broad class of materials that respond to macroscopic forces, such as electric and magnetic fields, thermal gradients, or radiation, enabling physical patterning approaches to nanofabrication. Finally, we mention that, although alloyed materials are beyond the scope of this Letter, the main results of this study may be valid for alloyed systems in the dilute limit and making proper use of effective binary diffusivities.
