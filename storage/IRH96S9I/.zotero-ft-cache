1. Introduction
Protein/polysaccharide complexes mostly originate from electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged macromolecules. To reduce further the free energy of the system, these soluble complexes further aggregate until their size and surface properties lead to insolubilization. Then, a liquid–liquid macroscopic phase separation occurs, leading to discrete liquid coacervate droplets coexisting with a dilute phase. At thermodynamic equilibrium, a two-phase system is
obtained comprising a coacervate phase coexisting with a solvent rich sub-phase [1–4]. The formation of electrostatic complexes and coacervates between proteins and polysaccharides occurs naturally in several living systems, triggering a variety of biological functions in so-called cognate biopolymeric systems [1]. For example, the sandcastle worm Phragmatopoma californica is able to secrete three highly polar proteins undergoing complex coacervation in order glue together exogenous mineral particles [5]. In more evolved organisms such as mammalians, electrostatic complexes formation was reported during the salt mediated interaction between cartilage lysozyme and proteoglycans, leading to the possible induction of cartilage calcification [6]. Perez Sanchez et al. [7] stressed out the formation a complex

between interferon γ (a cytokine with antiviral, antiproliferative and immunostimulating properties) and heparin, the major building block of proteoglycans. In another study, Seyrek et al. [8] clearly demonstrate that non-specific electrostatic binding occurring in the ionic strength range of 10 to 30 mM was responsible for the antithrombic activity of heparin. More recently, it was shown that complex formation between chicken egg white lysozyme-stabilized emulsions and mucins saliva proteins was directly linked to the oral flocculation of the oil droplets, triggering therefore sensorial response due to changes in viscosity [9]. Beside these cognate protein/polysaccharide complexes and coacervates, a wide range of non-cognate systems have been designed upon mixing macromolecules extracted from various origins. A good example of such non-cognate systems is the gelatin/acacia gum mixture that was used by Bungenberg de Jong [2] to set the experimental and theoretical bases of the complex coacervation phenomenon. These non-cognate systems have been mostly designed for technological purposes, as most of the time, the functional properties of the protein/polysaccharide complexes and coacervates were improved compared to those to the single macromolecules [10]. The various thermodynamical, physicochemical, structural and functional aspects of protein/polysaccharide complexes and coacervates have been summarized in several review papers [11,12] and two very detailed state-of-the-art book chapters [13,14]. This review represents an attempt to give a concise and comprehensive overview of specific applications of protein/polysaccharide electrostatic complexes and coacervates in food systems based on the literature published during the last 12 years considering the paper by Schmitt et al. [10] as the starting point. Specifically, the first section will described the parameters influencing the formation of protein/polysaccharide complexes and coacervates. In the next section, the characterization of the kinetics of phase separation and multi-scale structure of the complexes and coacervates will be considered before the investigation of the functional properties of complexes and coacervates for food applications will be discussed. This latter section will consider various technological aspects, namely: the viscosifying and gelling ability, the foaming and emulsifying ability and finally, the stabilization and release of bioactives or sensitive compounds.
2. Parameters influencing formation of protein/polysaccharide electrostatic complexes and coacervates
In the case of strong polyelectrolytes, the formation of protein/ polysaccharide complexes and coacervates is mainly driven by the
favorable reduction in the total free electrostatic energy of the system due to the release of counterions upon complex formation [15,16]. For weaker polyelectrolytes, it seems that a more favourable reduction of the enthalpy due to electrostatic attraction represents the driving force for complex formation [12,17]. Therefore, the energetics of complex formation has been mostly described to be enthalpy-driven as in the case of β-lactoglobulin complex formation with acacia gum, pectin, alginate or chitosan [18–21]. Another consequence of the electrostatically-driven formation of complexes is that several physicochemical parameters influencing the overall and local charge of the protein and the polysaccharide play an important role in the control of the phenomenon. The most important parameters are summarized on Fig. 1. They are mainly composed by pH, ionic strength, protein to polysaccharide ratio and total biopolymer concentration. Some other parameters such as the biopolymer molecular weight and flexibility, the charge density, the stirring, the pressure or the temperature have been shown to also influence complex formation. These parameters have been recently described in details for numerous protein/polysaccharide pairs [13,14]. Therefore we will here only discuss results for a narrow range of systems, where several of these parameters have been varied simultaneously. As a preliminary remark, it should be recalled that using light scattering methods, two critical pH values have been reported along the complex coacervation phenomenon: pHc corresponding to the formation of the initial soluble complexes and pHφ corresponding to the macroscopic phase separation of the system [22]. The influence of pH, protein/polysaccharide ratio and total biopolymer concentration was investigated for the β-lactoglobulin/acacia gum system [23]. It was clearly shown that the area of the two-phase region leading to complex formation and coacervation was increasing when the pH of the mixture decreased from 5.0 to 3.6 due to increased positive net charge on the protein, with optimum coacervation at pH 4.2 for a mixing ratio of 2:1. A similar effect was reported when gum acacia was mixed with a soy protein isolate [24,25] or with a wheat protein, αgliadin [26], with complexes obtained for a mixing ratio of 1:1 at a critical pHc 4.2 for soy protein and 3:1 at pHc 3.0 for α-gliadin. Interestingly, complexes could be formed at a much higher pH when acacia gum was replaced by a cationic polysaccharide such as chitosan, as pHc reached a value of 6.5 [27]. Schmitt et al. [28] reported on the additional effect of protein molecular weight (aggregation) on complex coacervation. The presence of protein aggregates was noticeably broadening the twophase region to total biopolymer concentration higher (≈20 wt.%) than predicted for the self-suppression of coacervation [29]. Protein aggregates could therefore be used to stabilize protein/polysaccharide

coacervates from coalescence and phase separation [30]. Nevertheless, after removal of the protein aggregates by centrifugation, complex coacervation was self-suppressed at a lower total biopolymer concentration of 4.5 wt.% at pH 4.2 [23]. Comparable results were obtained when a whey protein isolate (containing mainly βlactoglobulin) was mixed with acacia gum [31]. Complex formation could be observed up to 15 wt.% total biopolymer concentration at pH 4.0, but the optimum conditions for coacervation where found for a total biopolymer concentration of 2 wt.% and a protein to polysaccharide ratio of 2:1. In a mixture composed by the two flexible biopolymers gelatin and pectin, Plashchina et al. [32] reported a total biopolymer concentration of about 17 wt.% leading to self-suppression of complex formation. It is worth mentioning that the use of β-lactoglobulin aggregates obtained by heat treatment has been recently investigated in order to generate functional microparticles after complex formation with various anionic polysaccharides [33,34]. In addition, some naturally occurring protein aggregates like sodium caseinate can be used to generate stable nanoparticles upon complex formation with acacia gum [35] or chitosan [36]. For the whey protein isolate/acacia gum system, Weinbreck et al. [31] reported self-suppression of complex formation at an ionic strength of 70 mM of NaCl, in agreement to the model of Overbeek and Voorn [37]. When studying the formation of complexes between whey protein isolate and two other types of polysaccharides, λcarrageenan and a lactic bacteria exopolysaccharide (EPS B40), Weinbreck et al. [38,39] demonstrated the importance of the charge density of the polysaccharide on the formation of the complexes. Complex formation with λ-carrageenan (sulphated polysaccharide) was leading to precipitates due to the high charge density of the polysaccharide. The phosphorylated EPS B40 was leading to an intermediate behavior between acacia gum (carboxylated) and λcarrageenan. Nevertheless, the three systems were very comparable in terms of salt sensitivity as complex formation was suppressed in the range of 50 to 100 mM. Recently, Wang et al. [40] stressed out the possible effect of ionic strength on the formation of complexes between β-lactoglobulin and low-methylated (LM) pectin due to salt induced aggregation of the protein before complex formation. This salt dependence led to coacervates with a biopolymer content of 27.9 wt.% in presence of 210 mM NaCl vs. 9.1 wt.% when only 10 mM NaCl was used at pH 4.0. The system composed by bovine serum albumin and LM pectin seemed also to be very sensitive to ionic strength as 20 mM were leading to dissociation of the complexes [41]. The effect of the charge density on the formation of electrostatic complexes was confirmed on a milk protein/polysaccharide model (skimmed milk powder), where it was shown that the more sulfated polysaccharides were leading to complex formation at a higher critical pHc compared to polysaccharides with a lower charge density (carboxylated) [42]. Girard et al. [43] reported that 96% of βlactoglobulin could form complexes with LM pectin at pH 4.5 and a mixing ratio of 4:1, whereas only 78% were complexed when highmethylated (HM) pectin was used, showing again the importance of polysaccharide charge density on complex formation. This latter system was further investigated by changing the local charge density of the pectin, so-called degree of bulkiness [44]. It was found that for HM-pectins having the same degree of methylation, the one having the higher local charge density was able to form complexes with βlactoglobulin at a higher pHc (6.4 vs. 6.0), but interestingly at a higher ionic strength too (100 mM vs. 60 mM). The effect of temperature (25 or 50 °C) and shear (1000 s−1 or complex shear) was studied on the β-lactoglobulin/acacia gum system. Combinations of both parameters could either lead to a stable system (low temperature/complex shear) or to a very unstable one (high temperature/complex shear), with a marked phase separation due to the flocculation and coalescence of coacervates [45].
3. Kinetics of phase separation and multi-scale structure of protein/polysaccharide complexes and coacervates
Complex formation and coacervation in protein/polysaccharide mixtures are being mostly driven by charge neutralization, they are leading to very dynamic systems, especially when the biopolymer mixing is achieved in the conditions close to electroneutrality of the complexes. The next section will discuss some examples of time resolved evolution of the structure in protein/polysaccharide mixtures as well as the latest insights on the multi-scale microstructure of the complexes and coacervates.
3.1. Kinetics of phase separation
The kinetics of phase separation in the β-lactoglobulin/acacia gum system were investigated at the optimum pH of coacervation (i.e. 4.2) for 3 different protein to polysaccharide ratio (8:1, 2:1, 1:1) and total biopolymer concentrations of 1 and 5 wt.% using diffusing wave spectroscopy [46]. At ratio 8:1, the formed complexes and coavervates sedimented within less than 10 min due to coalescence of the particles. On the contrary, mixtures formed at a ratio of 1:1 exhibited much higher stability with a constant value of the diffused intensity over 1 h. Schmitt et al. [47] confirmed the very fast coarsening (within an hour) of the β-lactoglobulin and acacia gum mixture at pH 4.2, ratio 2:1 and 1 wt.% total biopolymer concentration by following the composition of the dilute phase after mixing. Similar fast rate of coacervate formation (0.3 mL min−1) was described by Weinbreck et al. [48] for the whey protein isolate/acacia gum mixture at pH 4.2 and an initial mixing concentration of 3 wt.%. In order to reduce the kinetics of phase separation, Sanchez et al. [49] studied the same system in diluted conditions (0.1 wt.% total biopolymer concentration) using small-angle static light scattering (SALS). The scattering pattern revealed the development of a correlation peak corresponding to the formation of discrete protein/polysaccharide complexes that coarsened following a power law model with a growth exponent of α = 0.5 (i.e. between the limiting values of 0.33 for diffusion growth and 1 for hydrodynamic coarsening). Interestingly, liquid droplets with sharp interface could be observed using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) with fluorescently labeled biopolymers. This finite interface could be surmised from the −3.6 slope of the I(q)/I (qmax) vs. q/qmax curves [50]. In order to better control the coarsening kinetics in various protein/polysaccharide systems, it was proposed to perform mixtures in non-interacting conditions and to induce formation of complexes and phase separation by in situ acidification of the mixture using hydrolysis of glucono-δ-lactone. Mekhloufi et al. [51] were able to determine precisely the critical pHc and pHφ for the β-lactoglobulin/ acacia gum system. This controlled in situ acidification enabled to access the initial steps of phase separation and to conclude that the coarsening mechanism was a nucleation and growth one [52]. This methodological approach was extended to β-lactoglobulin/pectin [53] and β-lactoglobulin/xanthan gum [54] mixtures. Depending on the initial protein to polysaccharide ratio, it was shown that electrostatic complexes did form and rearrange in order to optimize their free energy. This led to complexes with various fractal dimensions (Df) ranging from very linear ones (Df = 1.25) to much denser ones (Df = 2.5) for β-lactoglobulin/pectin system. In the case of xanthan gum, the fractal dimension varied between 2.07 and 2.44 depending on mixing ratio, and interestingly, the complexes were even able to form a stable electrostatic weak gel.
3.2. Multi-scale structure
The structure of the complexes and coacervates has been investigated with a variety of experimental techniques covering a very wide

range of structural levels ranging for the molecular structure of the protein in the complexes to the macroscopic structure of the coacervate. On a molecular level, it was shown that complex coacervation between β-lactoglobulin and acacia gum at pH 4.2 for a ratio of 2:1 induced a change in the secondary structure of the protein [55]. Hence, about 50% of the α-helix content of the β-lactoglobulin was lost as determined by circular dichroism measurements. The most likely explanation was the high content in basic amino acids in this region that was probably strongly interacting with the carboxylic groups from the acacia gum. This hypothesis was confirmed by a pH titration study carried out on the same system. It was found that maximum loss of helical secondary structure in β-lactoglobulin was obtained exactly at the pH of coacervation, i.e. 3.96 [51]. Interestingly, complex formation between β-lactoglobulin with LM pectin involved the same region of the protein, as underlined by a strong binding between the α-helical 132–148 peptide from β-lactoglobulin and pectin at pH 4.0 [56]. Changes in helical secondary structure were also reported for the wheat protein α-gliadin upon complex coacervation with acacia gum at pH 2.75 using Raman microspectroscopy [57]. On the contrary, when a β-sheet protein such as pea globulin did form a complex with acacia gum, most of the structural changes occurred in β-sheet rich regions, which might be due to some hydrogen bonding. An additional molecular insight was brought by 1H NMR relaxation study for the vegetable protein/acacia gum coacervates [58]. Thus, it was found that translational diffusion of water was promoted in the coacervate phase, whereas rotational motion was more restricted. From this set of experiments, one could therefore conclude to the dynamic nature of the coacervate phase. Before complex coacervation occurred, soluble protein/ polysaccharides complexes were formed, whose size increased simultaneously with the extent of charge neutralization. Mekhloufi et al. [51] described a hydrodynamic radius of 50 nm for β-lactoglobulin/ acacia gum soluble complexes. Intermolecular complexes with a diameter of 400 nm were then formed until macroscopic phase separation occurred. Just before macroscopic phase separation, it is worth noting that the size distribution of the complexes became very narrow, accounting for homogeneity of composition of the complexes within the system [18]. For a slightly more complex system composed by whey protein isolate and acacia gum, Weinbreck et al. [31] reported a very similar evolution of the size of the complexes. However, they additionally described a contraction of the acacia gum molecule due to the formation of the first soluble complexes upon charge neutralization and protein binding along the polysaccharide backbone. The spatial structure and composition of lysozyme/pectin complexes were recently accessed by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) [59]. It was found that soluble complexes were organized in dense globules having a hydrodynamic radius of 10 to 50 nm. A correlation peak was detected at 0.2 Å−1, corresponding to native lysozyme packed along pectin chains. The compaction of the protein was enhanced by the increase of the charge density of the pectin or the decrease in pH, leading to strong electrostatic attraction. Interestingly, authors determined a volume fraction of 0.1 for the complex, i.e. in good agreement with the reported water content of the coacervate phase of about 80 to 90% [23,40]. The diffusivity of the biopolymers was determined by 1H NMR and FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) in whey protein isolate/acacia gum coacervate phase obtained at pH 4.0–4.2 for a mixing ratio of 2:1 [60]. Both proteins and polysaccharides were moving independently in the coacervate phase, proteins having a 10 times higher diffusion coefficient than the acacia gum. As for the lyzozyme/pectin system, it was found that electrostatic interactions controlled the dynamics of the system since the mobility of the proteins was the lowest for conditions of exact charge neutralization, leading to a higher density of the coacervate. The same conclusion was drawn from the SAXS analysis of whey protein isolate/acacia gum coacervate obtained at various protein to polysaccharide ratio [48].
Using SANS on the β-lactoglobulin/pectin system, Wang et al. [61] described a heterogeneous microstructure of the coacervate depending on the charge density of the pectin, the ionic strength and the initial mixing ratio. A model including the presence of protein microdomains formed by protein self-association was proposed. Interestingly, such heterogeneous model of coacervate composed by dense and diluted domains was surmised by a recent study on bovine serum albumin/poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) coacervate which structure was probed by fluorescence microviscosity measurements [62]. In this final paragraph, the microstructure of the coacervate will be discussed. Owing to the recent development in confocal scanning laser microscopy, it was possible to investigate the structure of the coacervate phase for a variety of protein/polysaccharide systems. Lamprecht et al. [63] reported the formation of a sponge-like structure in the historical mixture based on gelatin and acacia gum. The holes were likely depleted in biopolymers (solvent rich), whereas the “core” of the sponge was mostly containing the two macromolecules. Such type of microstructure is depicted in Fig. 2 obtained for the β-lactoglobulin/acacia gum system. It appeared clearly that the sponge-like structure was due to the coalescence of vesicular single coacervates [46]. Upon maturation, the solvent droplets disappeared from the coacervate phase, leading to a homogenously fluorescing dense phase [47,50]. This exclusion of water from the coacervate phase was likely driven by the entropy gain generated by the free solvent molecules in the dilute phase. Very similar sponge-like microstructure was reported for gelatin/κ-carrageenan [64], fish gelatin/κ-carrageenan [65] or even acacia gum/chitosan mixtures [66].
4. Functional properties of protein/polysaccharide complexes and coacervates for food applications
Due to their specific structure, size and composition, proteinpolysaccharide complexes and coacervates are exhibiting a wide range of useful functionalities for the development of complex food products. The most promising ones will be described in the next section of this review.
4.1. Viscosifying and gelling ability
Rheological properties are related to the molecular characteristics of the biopolymers studied as for example their molecular weight, shape and flexibility. Additional factors are the biopolymer concentration and the interaction of the biopolymers with water as well as surrounding factors affecting these interactions such as pH, ionic strength and presence of other components/ligands. Protein/ polysaccharide mixed systems have been suggested to widen the

functional properties of each individual biopolymer. Rheological properties of protein and polysaccharide in associative conditions result in different rheological behaviours from each individual biopolymer. Intuitively, association of two polymers is expected to raise the bulk viscosity of the system as entities of larger sizes are formed. The rheological behaviour of several protein–polysaccharide mixed systems has been studied and ranged from viscous to viscoelastic properties with some systems even showing elastic behaviour. Effectively, conditions resulting in hydrated interpolymeric complexes and coacervates showed increase viscosity and the properties depend on the polysaccharide nature. For example, the viscous character of acacia gumprotein coacervates (G′′ being several times higher than G′) has been explained by the globular conformation of the polysaccharide [67] as compared to the gel-like system obtained with the same protein system mixed with a linear polysaccharide as pectin [40]. As the main stabilizing interactions between protein and polysaccharide are electrostatic, protein–polysaccharide ratio, pH and ionic strength are important determinants of rheological behaviour of complexes and coacervates. The maximum viscosity was reported in charge neutralization conditions [47,66,67]. Salt can induce less-structured protein–polysaccharide coacervates [48] or at low concentrations enhances complex formation [31,61]. There was an optimal salt concentration of 0.21 M NaCl favouring coacervate with higher β-lactoglobulin and pectin content and exhibiting stronger gel strength [40]. Higher concentrations favoured protein–protein interactions and coacervates contained more water and protein-rich domains. The conditions allowing forming coacervate or stable complexes have to be controlled as strong associative conditions could deteriorate solubility of complexes and their viscosity. For example, strong polyelectrolytes near the isoelectric point of protein will be subjected to strong intermolecular attractive forces. The system will have lower hydration capacity and consequently a lower viscosity [68,69]. Proteinpolysaccharide ratio can also modulate the rheological behaviour. At high ratio, protein–protein interactions can be favoured and polysaccharides, usually more viscous than proteins have little contribution to rheological properties of the system [13]. Generally, protein–polysaccharide coacervates and complexes rheological behaviour is shear thinning. It was easily related to the shear thinning behaviour of polysaccharide and of several concentrated protein solutions. Recently, Liberatore et al. [70] studied the shear thinning behaviour of a polyelectrolyte/micelle system using simultaneous small-angle light scattering during rheological measurements. They showed that the shear thinning was explained by a phase separation. Under shear, the coacervates undergo a transition from a homogeneous isotropic one-phase solution to a heterogeneous anisotropic phase-separated system. The scattering pattern was more sensitive than flow rheology as some micrometer-scale structures were observed before the samples shear thin. This new approach will allow getting additional insights on kinetics of phase separation of coacervates. Some of the mixed protein–polysaccharide system showed gelling properties. The possible effect of an interacting polysaccharide on the rheological behaviour of protein-based food is well known and several examples can be found in the dairy industry. The use of carrageenan to improve rheological properties as well as heat stability is well documented [71]. Similarly, lactic acid bacteria producing exopolysaccharide are now widely used in yogurt applications to avoid commercial stabilizer's addition [72]. Several exopolysaccharide wear negative charges and are able to interact with dairy proteins during the acidification of yogurt [73]. Compared to neutral exopolysaccharides, those having a high negative charge allowed gel formation at a higher pH and increased gel firmness. However, these gels were more brittle and shear recovery was hindered. The strength of associative interactions modulated the capacity for the gel to rebuild (as required for stirred yogurt) [73]. Associative interactions can also participate to
strengthen protein–polysaccharide heat-set gels [74,75]. Furthermore, Laneuville et al. [54] obtained strong translucent gels at very low concentrations and a wide range of native β-lactoglobulin–xanthan gum ratios. Several other proteins (BSA, ovalbumin) and polysaccharides (gellan gum, carrageenan) showed very similar behaviour. These mixed systems obtained under associative conditions and without heat treatment have been proposed as delivery matrices of sensible compounds but combination of associative electrostatic conditions with a combined heat treatment to denature the protein also allowed to obtain nanogels to be used in non-food applications [76]. Similar approaches could find uses in the food area. Viscoelastic properties of complexes and coacervates play an important role in other important functional properties as foaming and emulsifying properties as will be discussed in the next section.
4.2. Foaming and emulsifying ability
Protein/polysaccharide complexes and coacervates are combining physicochemical and functional properties of their constituting macromolecules, especially their hydrophobic/hydrophilic character [10]. They can therefore be advantageously used as ingredients to stabilize the air/water or the oil/water interface in a variety of complex food systems [77]. Schmitt et al. [47] studied the interfacial properties of βlactoglobulin/acacia gum complexes obtained at pH 4.2 and a mixing ratio of 2:1 at the air/water interface and compared them with pure βlactoglobulin. The surface activity of the complexes was as high as for the pure protein, but protein/polysaccharide complexes were forming much stronger viscoelastic interfacial films with a thickness of about 250 Å [78]. Consequently, the gas permeability of a thin-film stabilized by the complexes was significantly reduced (0.021 cm s−1) compared to pure β-lactoglobulin (0.521 cm s−1). This interfacial stabilization effect was markedly preserved in aqueous foams that were presenting much reduced rates of interfacial area loss and air bubble coarsening when complexes were used. Further, it was shown that the kinetics of phase separation was very important in controlling the final air/water interfacial properties of β-lactoglobulin/acacia gum complexes [18]. Comparing freshly formed complexes with coacervates obtained after one day, it was shown that interfacial properties and subsequent foam stability of the complexes was much higher than for coacervates. The likely explanation was due to the different structures of the interface formed by complexes and coacervates as can be seen on Fig. 3. Complexes were able to re-organize at the interface by coalescence, forming an interfacial microgel with lower gas permeability (Fig. 3A) whereas coacervates formed a strong elastic film (Fig. 3B) with much higher gas permeability. These findings were applied for the formulation of complex food products such as strawberry ice cream and lemon sherbet for which improved air bubble stability was correlated with an increased perception of creaminess after sensory evaluation by a trained panel [79]. A similar improvement of air bubble stability was also obtained in chilled dairy mousses, enabling replacement of gelatin by whey protein isolate/acacia gum complexes [79]. Complexes based on β-lactoglobulin/pectins were also used to stabilize the air/water interface [80]. In this case, the charge density of the pectin (degree of methylation) and the mixing ration could be used to trigger the size of the complexes and consequently their surface activity. The viscoelastic properties of the air/water interface could be modulated by either adsorbing simultaneously protein/polysaccharide complexes or proceeding to sequential adsorption of the protein, followed by the polysaccharide. In this case, much stronger viscoelastic films were obtained [81]. The structure of these films was further investigated by neutron reflectivity and both films presented a denser layer close to the air/water interface that was probably composed by β-lactoglobulin. However, the thickness of the film obtained with sequentially adsorbed complexes was larger (450 Å) than for simultaneously adsorbed complexes (250 Å) [82]. Similarly,

complexes based on ovalbumin/pectin [83] or β-lactoglobulin/ carboxylated pullulan [84] were shown to exhibit air/water surface activity and could be used for foam stabilization. Very recently, a protein isolated from rape meal (napin) was complexed with pectins to stabilize aqueous foams. As for β-lactoglobulin/acacia gum complexes, napin/pectin complexes were more surface-active than the pure protein [85]. Interfacial films with a thickness of 315 Å were formed in the foam, leading a reduced drainage rate and improved foam volume stability compared to pure napin foams. Contrarily to foam stabilization, the use of protein/polysaccharide complexes for emulsion stabilization received much more attention. A partial explanation could reside in the practical industrial feasibility to control emulsion formation compared to foam formation. Basically, emulsions could be stabilized either by complexes or coacervates produced during the emulsification step, leading to mixed emulsions [86] or by using the so-called layer-by-layer technique. In this case, a primary emulsion is stabilized by a protein and thereafter dropped in a polysaccharide dispersion to induce interfacial complex formation leading to so-called bilayer emulsions [86,87]. The bilayer technology is the most commonly used at industrial scale, even if the two processes seem to generate emulsions having different colloidal behaviors which might be explained by a different structure of the interface [88]. Hence, interfacial shear rheology experiments on sodium caseinate/dextran sulfate showed that mixed interfaces were much more viscoelastic than bilayers, even if the bilayer films evolved towards equilibrium viscoelastic moduli of mixed ones (after 2500 to 4000 min), due to possible re-organization of the protein within the interfacial layer [88]. Interestingly the obtained emulsions exhibited different pH stability, especially in acidic conditions where the mixed emulsion was shown to be much more stable against bridging flocculation compared to the bilayer ones. These results could have some interesting practical application for controlling in vivo lipolysis. Interestingly a similar pH stability was obtained when dextran sulfate was replaced by the sulfated ι-carrageenan polysaccharide [89]. Using pea globulin or α-gliadin complexes or coacervates with acacia gum, Ducel et al. [90] reported a greater oil/water surface activity for the complexes. Coacervates films were characterized by a very long relaxation time and a high surface elasticity. Additionally, authors reported that coacervates obtained at lower pH were more suitable for the production of emulsions due to a higher spreadability at the interface of the oil droplets. Cho and McClements [91] highlighted the importance of controlling the protein to polysaccharide ratio and polysaccharide concentration to ensure colloidal stability of bilayer emulsion stabilized by βlactoglobulin and pectin at pH 3.5 for various oil contents. Too low (b0.02 wt.%) or high (N0.1 wt.%) pectin contents were leading to
unstable emulsion due to depletion flocculation or the bridging flocculation, whereas intermediate polysaccharide content produced stable systems. In another study, the additional effect of the ionic strength was demonstrated, 100 mM NaCl leading to more stable βlactoglobulin/citrus pectin emulsions at pH 3–4 compared to emulsions stabilized only with β-lactoglobulin, where interfacial charge screening by the salt was much easily achieved [92]. Several other protein/polysaccharide pairs (β-lactoglobulin complexed with alginate, ι-carrageenan or acacia gum) were used to produce acid stable bilayer emulsions and might find interesting application in the beverage industry [93,94]. In a last study, an additional gelatin layer was formed on the β-lactoglobulin/ι-carrageenan bilayer enabling production of emulsion responding to multiple environmental stresses such as pH, ionic strength or temperature changes [95]. The use of the cationic chitosan enables production of stable emulsions based on whey protein isolate closer to the neutral pH range, i.e. pH 6.0 [96]. However, like for the other systems already described, it was important to define an optimum protein to polysaccharide mixing ratio to prevent emulsion flocculation [97]. Interestingly, whey protein isolate/chitosan complexes could also be formed at much lower pH (3.0), where complexes could lower surface tension to the same extent than pure proteins [98]. Stable concentrated emulsions (40% rapeseed oil) could be obtained for a wide range of total biopolymer concentrations ranging from 3.8 to 11.2 wt.% enabling an additional control of bulk viscosity. Very recently, the stability and microstructure of 15% sunflower emulsions stabilized by whey protein isolate was fine-tuned by the formation of chitosan/acacia gum coacervates at pH 3.0, leading to monodispersed droplets, gelled emulsion network, or clusters of oil droplets depending on the chitosan/acacia gum ratio [99]. The emulsifying properties of whey protein isolate/carboxymethylcellulose were shown to strongly depend on the protein to polysaccharide ratio for oil fractions of 10 and 20%. Interestingly, the use of complexes enables production of heat stable emulsions, which was not the case for pure protein systems [100]. Very similar results were obtained on the same system, but additionally it was reported that emulsions based on whey protein isolate/carboxymethylcellulose complexes were more heat stable than those based on whey protein concentrate/carboxymethylcellulose complexes. In addition, complex-stabilized emulsions were exhibiting strong droplet size freeze stability upon storage at −15 °C for 7 days [101]. Complexes between whey protein isolate and HM-pectin could also be used for emulsion stabilization at pH 5.5 [102]. Stable oil droplets were obtained when the protein to polysaccharide ratio was leading to a net negative electrophoretic mobility, enabling strong electrostatic repulsion between droplet surfaces. Recently, such

complexes were also shown to be able to stabilize the external interface of W/O/W emulsions prepared at pH ≤ 6.0 [103]. In a last example concerning emulsifying properties of protein/ polysaccharide complexes and coacervates, it is worth mentioning the use of the whey protein isolate/acacia gum system [104]. The control of the spreading properties of the coacervate at the surface of the oil droplets was very important and therefore it was advised to choose a total biopolymer concentration of 0.5 to 1.0 wt.% for a mixing ratio of 2:1 at pH 4.0 for an oil fraction of 5%. These emulsions were used thereafter for entrapment of flavors and delivery in food matrices, the release rate being controlled by the size of the oil droplets (small or large) or by the structure of the interface (cross-linking or not).
4.3. Stabilization and release of bioactive or sensitive compounds
The remarkable interfacial properties of protein/polysaccharides complexes and coacervates described before make them valuable ingredients to produce microcapsules or different types of emulsions (simple, multiple, layer-by-layer, etc.) to protect or encapsulate sensitive compounds. Generally, encapsulation encompasses all aspects of protection/stabilization of sensitive molecules (flavours and bioactives) against processing (heat, redox potential, shear, etc.) and storage conditions (temperature, light, oxygen, and moisture). It also concerns controlled release enabling delivery of the encapsulated material with the optimal kinetics (in the food or the mouth for the flavour) and to specific gastrointestinal targets (for bioactives). Encapsulation conditions should be gentle for sensible compounds and the release can be controlled by mechanical process (chewing), pH variations (acidic conditions in the stomach, neutral in the intestine) or enzymatic action. Complex coacervation is well adapted for food applications as this technique neither uses organic solvents nor requires drastic temperatures [10]. Encapsulation was one of the first applications of acacia gumgelatine coacervates since papers and patents are reported as early as in 1970s [11]. The unique gelling-melting profile of gelatine generates interesting properties for microencapsulation. Viscous coacervates can be prepared at 50–60 °C, a temperature higher than gel point of gelatine while on cooling interface's rigidity increases resulting in a stable gelled shell around the microcapsule. During consumption, the shell will be disrupted as gelatine is readily melted in the mouth. Since then, these two macromolecules have been used to encapsulate various materials, oil based or even solid. Recently, Yeo et al. [105] used gelatine–acacia gum coacervates to encapsulate flavours to be released during cooking in baked goods. Flavour delivery is the most promising application of coacervates. Hence, most lipophilic flavours can be dispersed in an oil droplet surrounded by a coacervate layer. These microcapsules are able to undergo solvent exchange by diffusion through this layer; this is a unique property of coacervate microcapsules [106]. The diffusional release rate depends upon the ease and rate at which the encapsulated material can migrate through the coacervate layer [107]. Using CSLM and analysis of fluorescence intensity, Lamprecht et al. [108] showed interestingly that the distribution of gelatin and acacia gum in the wall of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester containing-microcapsules was quite homogeneous, even if microcapsules were produced by the layer-by-layer technique. This confirms the assumption of interfacial film reorganisation described recently by Jourdain et al. [88]. Flavour is a complex mixture of many compounds having a broad range of structure with different vapour pressure, solvent solubility and stability [106]. This represents an important challenge to design a useful encapsulation technology. Nevertheless, several factors can achieve specific properties of coacervate-based encapsulation. In addition to gelatin-acacia gum, several other proteins and polysaccharides have been studied (whey proteins, plant proteins, LM pectin, and xanthan gum) to widen capsules properties [26,34,104,109,110]. Whey protein–acacia gum
coacervates were used to encapsulate lemon and orange flavours [104] and flavour release was studied in a model Gouda cheese. Large capsules (50–1000 μm) were more easily released from the cheese matrix probably broken during chewing compared to smaller capsules (5–50 μm). Process parameters as environmental conditions (pH, ionic strength, macromolecular ratio) and mechanical treatments (spraydrying, homogenisation) also allow modulating the coacervate layer properties (thickness, swelling rate, etc.) [111,112]. Cross-linking agents can further contribute to harden the coacervate layer after formation of the microcapsules [107]. Reticulation can be enzymatically or chemically achieved. Transglutaminase introduces covalent links between carboxyl group of a glutamine and amino group of lysine in protein molecules. Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have been studied but are non-food reagents. However, food grade alternatives have been recently studied as tannic acid [113,114], plant phenolics [115] and glycerine [116]. The bilayer emulsion, formed by successive adsorption of biopolymers at the interface is another way to play with the microcapsule properties. The interface is made of superimposed biopolymer layers. Guzey and McClements [94] described a better control of the interface structure, charge, thickness and permeability that should allow improved stability and controlled release. Sagis et al. [117] added HM-pectin and whey proteins (pre-heated to denature the proteins) in alternate on emulsion droplets and observed increased freeze-drying stability. McClements [118] recently reviewed this topic and presented these multilayer emulsions as means to control bioavailability and release of lipids to specific site of action depending on layer composition and properties.
5. Conclusion
In this review, we have shown that many advances have been made in the field of protein–polysaccharide complexes and coacervates during the last 12 years. Especially, an increasing number of polymer pairs have been investigated, enabling to identify the most important physicochemical parameters controlling complex formation (pH, ionic strength, biopolymer mixing ratio, total biopolymer concentration, and polymer charge density). In addition, the multiscale structure and phase separation kinetics of complexes and coacervates are much better understood, enabling the design of complex food systems based on complexes and coacervates. Hence, it was shown that these entities exhibited very interesting viscosifying and gelling properties that could lead to gel-like processed food products obtained without thermal treatment. The interfacial properties of complexes and coacervates seem very wide and open new avenues in the way dispersed food systems could be stabilized. This could consequently lead to very promising structures, textures and shelf-life stability. Finally, the use of protein–polysaccharide complexes and coacervates as delivery systems for bioactives or sensitive molecules in food seems also very attractive owing to the variety of biopolymer coupled that could be adapted to the various delivery constraints (e.g. HLB, mechanical properties, and permeability). In addition, it should be noticed that the biopolymers from complexes or coacervates can themselves constitute the bioactive agent (proteins and derived peptides). Nevertheless, it should be taken into account that for availability or cost reasons, food ingredients are rarely pure and therefore the conditions of complex formation obtained for “pure systems” should be refined to fit with “real systems” and adapted to the food processing conditions (pH, ionic strength, temperature, shear, emulsifying and aerating device). Only this way would allow to master and take advantage of the full potential of these very special colloids.
