There are still compounds to identify, and
new data indicate that already known DBPs
may pose additional health risks.
D
isinfection of drinking
water is rightly hailed as a
major public health tri
umph of the 20th century.
Before its widespread use, millions of
people died from typhoid, cholera, and
other infectious waterborne diseases.
Disinfection targeted the microbial
pathogens causing these diseases, and
deaths attributable to these waterborne
pathogens virtually ceased in devel
oped nations (1). Recent outbreaks of
Escherichia coli-induced gastroenteri
tis (Walkerton, Ontario, 2000), cryp
tosporidiosis (Milwaukee, Wisc., 1993),
and cholera (Peru beginning in 1991)
serve as dramatic reminders of the
need to properly disinfect drinking
water and continually reevaluate and
improve disinfection techniques.
Although pathogenic organisms provide the primary human health risk from drinking water, chemical disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are another, albeit unintended, health hazard. Disinfectants are powerful oxidants that convert organic matter and naturally occurring bromide in source waters to DBPs. Chlorine, ozone, chlorine dioxide, and chloramine are the most common disinfectants in use today, and each produces its own suite of chemical DBPs in drinking water (2). Most developed nations regulate or control DBPs to minimize consumers’ exposure to
hazardous compounds, while maintaining adequate disinfection and control of targeted pathogens. As such, developed nations often have the opportunity to evaluate the nature and magnitude of human health risks posed by DBPs and implement changes in drinking water treatment when necessary. This has led to research on and use of alternative disinfection strategies. In this article, we review the current status of DBP research, describing new human epidemiological, animal toxicological, and occurrence data, as well as new research efforts to identify additional compounds. We also outline arenas for future work.
Isn’t this problem solved?
In 1974, Rook identified the first DBPs—chloroform and the other trihalomethanes (THMs)—in chlorinated drinking water (3). Two years later, the U.S. EPA published a national survey that showed that chloroform and the other THMs were ubiquitous in chlorinated drinking water (4). That same year, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) published results linking chloroform to cancer in laboratory animals (5). An important public health and regulatory issue was born. Today, many drinking water utilities are switching from chlorine to alternative disinfectants such as ozone, chlorine dioxide, and chloramine to comply with regulations (6, 7) controlling THMs and haloacetic acids (HAAs) (see sidebar on the next page), but this has created new issues. Source water conditions, including bromide, iodide, and natural organic matter (NOM) concentrations, and pH, can affect the levels and types of DBP species formed. For example, ozone use can significantly reduce or eliminate THM and HAA formation; however, it can produce bromate—a potent carcinogen in laboratory animals (8)—in source waters with elevated bromide levels. Another concern is that although ~500 DBPs are known (2), few have been investigated for their quantitative occurrence and health effects. DBPs that have been quantified in drinking water are generally present at nanogram to microgram per liter (μg/L or parts-per-billion [ppb]) levels. Until recently, health
effects studies were directed primarily toward link

ing chronic DBP exposure and cancer initiation or mutagenicity. Moreover, there are still unknown DBPs; only ~50% of total organic halide (TOX) formed during drinking water chlorination has been identified (9). Studies are under way to uncover the missing DBP fraction, such as unidentified TOX and assimilable organic carbon (AOC) compounds in ozonated drinking water. As a
result, new research is focusing on highly polar, highmolecular-weight compounds. In addition, epidemiological studies are raising new concerns about DBPs’ effects on reproduction and development, including low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, and spontaneous abortion. Generally, these studies only can show a correlation between exposure and health effects, not
causality. Moreover, it is difficult to assess a consumer’s exposure to DBPs or mixtures of DBPs, which creates additional uncertainties in these epidemiological studies. Currently available single-chemical studies with animals cannot alone explain the adverse health effects observed in some epidemiological studies. Thus, toxicological investigations of DBP mixtures are needed. Other routes of exposure are now being recognized as significant. For example, recent work shows that a person showering or bathing can receive twice the exposure to THMs as ingesting 2 L of water (10). New human exposure work is also being conducted in which blood and urine are being monitored for DBP exposures (11−15). Numerous workshops and conferences have been organized to address the new concerns about DBPs. These include a Health Canada-sponsored conference on assessing exposure in epidemiological studies of DBPs in 2000; the International Society of Exposure Analysis symposium on new DBP exposure and epidemiological studies in 2000; an international conference entitiled “Disinfection By-products: The Way Forward” in 1998; an American Water Works Association symposium on microbial and DBP health effects in 2000; an International Life Sciences Institute workshop on the health effects of DBPs in 1995; “Balancing Chemical and Microbial Risks of DBPs” in 1993 and 1999; “Identification of New and Uncharacterized DBPs” in 1998; and an EPA-sponsored workshop called “Risk Assessment of DBPs and Considering Unidentified DBPs” in 2000.
Epidemiological and human exposure studies
Of the recently conducted epidemiological studies, Swan and Waller’s 1998 study of spontaneous abortions for more than 5000 pregnant women in California probably attracted the most attention (16, 17). One test group consumed tap water high in THMs (≥75 μg/L) but within EPA’s regulatory limits; another consumed water lower in THMs (<75 μg/L). A statistically significant, nearly two-fold increase in spontaneous abortions was observed for those women daily drinking five or more glasses of cold tap water with the higher THM levels; the strongest association for which was observed with tap water containing the DBP bromodichloromethane at levels of ≥18 μg/L. Earlier epidemiological cancer studies of people consuming chlorinated tap water had revealed weaker associations. Currently, exposure assessment is a principal limitation of epidemiological studies (18). In their 1998 study, THM concentrations were estimated by averaging quarterly data provided by drinking water utilities (16, 17 ). Waller and co-workers recently reanalyzed their pregnancy outcome data using weighting factors to adjust utility-wide THM averages for variance from the average, re-estimating THM exposures by using measurements from sampling sites within 0.5 miles of the subjects’ homes, and taking into account exposure due to showering (19). When the original study was corrected for exposure misclassifications, statistical significance was lost but the trend of excess risk remained. However, when the util

Controlling DBP exposure
Following the identification of DBPs in drinking water, EPA issued a regulation in 1979 to control THMs at 100 μg/L (ppb) in drinking water (6 ). Subsequently, in 1998, the Stage 1 Disinfectants/Disinfection By-products (D/DBP) Rule was promulgated, lowering permissible levels of THMs to 80 μg/L and regulating five of the HAAs, bromate, and chlorite for the first time (Table 1) (7). Stage 1 regulations are based on running annual averages—averages of all samples collected in a utility’s distribution system over a one-year period. The Rule took effect January 1, 2002.
Stage 2 D/DBP Rule, to be proposed in 2002, will maintain the Stage 1 Rule maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for THMs and HAAs, but will require that MCLs for THMs and HAAs be based on locational running annual averages—each location in the distribution system will need to comply on a running annual average basis. The change arises because the running annual averages used with the Stage 1 D/DBP Rule permitted some locations within a water distribution system to exceed MCLs, as long as the average of all sampling points did not exceed the MCLs. As a result, some consumers could receive water that regularly exceeded the MCLs. The Stage 2 D/DBP Rule targets those higher DBP levels and reduces the variability of exposure within a distribution system. Although the Stage 2 D/DBP Rule will maintain the MCLs for bromate and chlorite, EPA plans to re-examine the bromate MCL as part of its six-year review process.

ity-wide average analysis was restricted to a subset of women for whom exposure assessment was considered to be more accurate, a statistically significant three-fold increase in spontaneous abortion was found for those with a high personal exposure (≥75 μg/L THMs, ≥5 glasses of cold tap water per day). Efforts are also under way to improve models for predicting DBP formation in drinking water treatment (20, 21), and this may provide more accurate exposure information for use in epidemiological studies. Other recent epidemiological studies suggest an association between chlorinated tap water and reproductive/developmental effects, including stillbirth, low birth weight, neural tube defects, and other congenital effects (22–31). New animal toxicological results also suggest that brominated DBPs, such as bromodichloromethane, may be more associated with adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes than chlorinated analogs, such as chloroform. The largest epidemiological study of drinking water DBPs and adverse human birth outcomes began in the United Kingdom in 1999 and includes ~17 million people (32). The U.K. study is a retrospective cohort study over the 19921998 period that is examining ~1 million births for outcomes such as stillbirths, low birth weights, birth weight distributions, and sex ratio. The research aims to determine whether areas with high THM levels are associated with increased adverse birth outcomes. This study may have the most statistical power of any reproductive/developmental epidemiological investigation yet undertaken and should provide statistically sound information about the relationship between THMs and chlorinated tap water and adverse birth outcomes. The first phase, which investigates socioeconomic influences on adverse birth outcomes, is due to be completed in 2002; full study results are anticipated in 2004. At the University of North Carolina School of Public Health in Chapel Hill, researchers are also studying whether DBP exposure increases spontaneous abortion risk. They plan to identify ~3000 women prior to or early in pregnancy who live in areas with either relatively high chlorinated DBPs concentrations, relatively high brominated DBP levels, or relatively low overall DBP levels. Their research will combine detailed assessments of DBP levels in the public water supplies, behavioral determinants of exposure, and ultrasound assessment of early pregnancy. Results of the study are anticipated in 2005.
Collaborating scientists from the Sequoia Foundation, the California Department of Health Sciences, and the University of Missouri–Columbia are examining the relationship between DBP exposure and menstrual function, semen quality, and time-to-pregnancy. In addition, the effect of DBPs on menstrual cycle length and ovulation, sex steroid hormone levels, and pregnancy in 400 California women and sperm motility and morphology of 157 husbands is being investigated. The completed study is due in 2002. At the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (11, 12), NCI, EPA, Health Canada (10), the University of Alberta (Canada) (13), Rutgers University (14, 15), and elsewhere, scientists are conducting studies on DBP exposure and uptake in the human body. These investigations will provide more accurate information about individual exposures than the traditionally used water consumption questionnaires and quarterly water treatment plant data. At CDC, researchers measured THM blood levels of human volunteers following drinking, showering, and bathing (11). The 10-minute shower produced the highest THM blood levels, with ingestion of 1 L of water yielding only a slight blood level increase. CDC and collaborators from EPA, University of North Carolina, Texas State Department of Health,Wilkes Associates, and Colorado State University have compared THM internal dose levels for women of reproductive age living in two states with different DBP speciation in household waterone with a higher brominated THM content, the other with more chlorinated THMs (12). The speciation differences found in tap water were mirrored in the women’s blood samples. DBPs have also been measured in the exhaled breath of people exposed to DBPs through drinking, showering, and bathing (10, 14, 15), in the blood and exhaled breath of swimmers (33–35), and in the urine of individuals exposed to HAAs through drinking water (13). Researchers at NCI, CDC, and EPA are planning a collaborative human exposure study to identify previously undetected markers of exposure to nonvolatile DBPs and their metabolites in urine. The goal is to improve the understanding of human metabolism of these DBPs. As a complement to ongoing human exposure efforts, EPA researchers are developing a human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for bromodichloromethane. The model will be based initially on an extrapolation of a rat PBPK model to humans (36, 37). The model will be tested by comparing its predictions with blood and breath concentrations

Nationwide occurrence study
Most previous measurements of DBPs in drinking water have focused on a few chemical DBPs—usually <20, and typically only THMs and/or HAAs. To determine whether other DBPs pose an adverse health risk, more comprehensive quantitative occurrence and toxicity data are needed. To address this issue, scientists at EPA’s National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) initiated a Nationwide DBP Occurrence Study (38–40). Because it is not feasible to quantify all DBPs identified in U.S. waters, a multidisciplinary group of experts prioritized
>500 DBPs reported in the literature according to their predicted adverse health effects, selecting ~50 highpriority DBPs for study (41). This is the first investigation in which DBPs were chosen because of predicted adverse health effects. The compounds are being quantified in high-bromide source waters and waters treated with chlorine, ozone, chlorine dioxide, and chloramine. Scientists from the EPA’s Office of Water; Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances; and National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory were involved in the initial prioritization effort; researchers from the University of North Carolina and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California are collaborating with NERL on the study, which should be completed this year.
New toxicity studies
Absent definitive epidemiological data sets, toxicological evaluation of complex DBP mixtures in experimental animals would provide useful information for estimating potential human health risks. Moreover, studies focusing on health endpoints of concern identified in epidemiological studies can bridge the gap between animal single-chemical experiments and human exposures to multiple DBPs. To address this problem, scientists from EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) are performing a joint chemical and toxicological evaluation
of DBP mixtures produced by different water treatment processes (42). The project focuses on evaluating concentrates of complex mixtures formed during disinfection of bromide-containing water because recent toxicological work with single chemicals suggests that, for some endpoints, brominated DBPs, such as bromodichloromethane, cause greater toxicity than chlorinated analogs. In addition to spiking the source water with bromide, iodide will also be added to simulate natural waters (iodide is typically present in waters with bromide) and to potentially generate iodinated DBPs, which are suspected of having adverse health effects (41). The ORD’s full-study research plan includes in vivo toxicological assays and short-term in vitro experiments. Reproductive and developmental endpoints are targeted, with assays for other important endpoints and target organs, such as mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, developmental neurotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics, included where possible. Extensive chemical analyses of drinking water concentrates will assess which DBPs and chemicals are present and quantitatively measure as many as possible. Comprehensive DBP identifications will be performed, and up to 80 DBPs will be quantified, including high-priority DBPs predicted by experts to cause adverse health effects. Results of preliminary experiments, designed around methods for concentrating the large water volumes needed for the full study, should be published soon. EPA is also conducting new toxicity research—singlechemical tests and defined mixtures—on high-priority DBPs, such as iodo-THMs and brominated compounds, to identify those that are toxic and lead to adverse health effects and to understand mechanisms of action. One study found that brominated THMs are more potent inducers of aberrant colonic crypts (precursors to colon cancer) in male F344 rats than chloroform, with the number of crypts correlated with the number of bromine atoms (43, 44). Differences in the metabolic activation of THMs discovered by EPA researchers suggest a mechanistically based explanation for the greater mutagenic potency of brominated THMs relative to chloroform, which suggests new directions for DBP research and risk assessment. EPA researchers found a pathway for the metabolic activation of bromodichloromethane, through conjugation with glutathione (a tripeptide present in all animal cells) that results in bromodichloromethane-induced genotoxicity (45). Although this mutagenicity pathway is of relatively little importance for chloroform (45), it is important for bromoform and chlorodibromomethane (46), suggesting that the role of glutathione-mediated metabolic activation in the toxicity of brominated DBPs should be investigated further. Understanding the DBP metabolic pathways is important because in some cases a metabolite of the parent compound is the actual toxicant. Researchers with the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and EPA are examining the reproductive and developmental toxicity of several DBPs (47 ). One prominent finding is that although epidemiological studies rely on THMs as a surrogate for assessing ex

posure to complex DBP mixtures in drinking water, animal data suggest that the HAAs provide a stronger link to the cardiac malformations and neural tube defects observed in some human epidemiological studies. Research examining DBP effects on the reproductive ability of male rats indicates that although dichloroacetic acid and bromoacetic acid produce similar testicular toxicity, bromoacetic acid is more potent (48). NTP is also looking at the neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity of selected DBPs. Some high-priority DBPs, most notably halonitromethanes, are being tested at the University of Illinois with mammalian cell assays that measure DNA damage (49). Halonitromethanes were found to be extremely cytotoxic and genotoxic—more than most currently regulated DBPs, including bromate (50). The assay also discovered that 3-chloro-4(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX)the most mutagenic compound yet identified in chlorinated drinking water, according to the Ames test—is not as potent a mutagen in mammalian cells. Pharmacokinetic research being conducted at EPA and elsewhere provides a basis for extrapolating health effects observed in laboratory animals to humans. Researchers at the Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have discovered that biotransformation and urinary clearance of the HAAs (acetates) is influenced by the number and type of halogen substituents (51). They have also discovered that bromochloroacetic acid—the only chiral HAA—exhibits pronounced stereospecific pharmacokinetics in both rat liver and in human liver cytosol (52). At the University of Montreal, researchers have demonstrated that the kinetics of THMs in blood is influenced by concurrent administration with another THM (binary combination) or by administration as a quaternary THM mixture (53, 54).
Uncovering the “missing DBPs”
Researchers are continually trying to identify those missing DBPs (Figure 1) (9, 55). Because TOX and AOC represent only some types of DBPs formed, the percentage of DBPs unaccounted for is undoubtedly much higher than these surrogate measures indicate. At EPA, scientists have used low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and infrared spectroscopy to identify DBPs in the unknown fraction (56), and liquid chromatography/MS to determine the highly polar DBPs that are difficult or impossible to extract and difficult to identify using conventional gas chromatography/MS. (57). The researchers also plan to use toxicity assays to direct future work toward the most toxicologically significant DBPs. At the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, scientists used ultrafiltration membranes to separate molecular weight fractions (<500, 5003000, 3000–10,000, and >10,000 Da) of TOX formed by chlorination and chloramination of drinking water (58). Surprisingly, ~50% of TOX produced from chlorination had an apparent molecular weight >500 Da, ~30% had an apparent molecular weight of 500–3000 Da, and ~8% had an apparent molecular weight >10,000 Da. Although it is nearly impossible to precisely identify a compound with a molecular weight
>1000 Da using current analytical tools, toxicologists often assume that compounds above ~5000 Da are probably not absorbed in the body and may not be important from a toxicological standpoint. This remains to be determined experimentally. Moreover, it is unknown whether human enzymes or acid-catalyzed hydrolysis might break these large molecules into smaller ones that could be absorbed. Although analysis of the unidentified, high-molecular-weight (>1000 Da) fraction is daunting, University of Illinois and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California researchers have designed studies to address the issue (59). To improve the detection of this high-molecular-weight TOX, labeling studies are being carried out using 36Cl-labeled chlorine with analysis of the DBPs using ultrafiltration/size exclusion chromatography, electrospray ionization MS, and MS/MS.
Reducing DBPs
Mainly because of stricter DBP regulations, efforts have been made to minimize certain compounds before, during, or after disinfectant treatment. Enhanced coagulation, which is used at many utilities, removes precursor NOM before disinfection. Although all of the NOM is not removed, this practice reduces DBP levels. Advanced precursor removal technologies include granular activated carbon (GAC) and mem

branes—nanofiltration or reverse osmosis. Because enhanced coagulation and GAC do not remove bromide, the bromide/NOM ratio is higher in treated water and can shift DBP formation to more brominated compounds. Membranes such as reverse osmosis and, to varying extents, nanofiltration can remove bromide. During treatment, the type of disinfectant can be changed (e.g., from chlorine to chloramine or another alternative) to alter the levels of THMs and HAAs. Current researchas part of the Nationwide DBP Occurrence Studyis showing that alternative disinfectants are better at controlling THMs and trihalogenated HAAs than dihalogenated HAAs and other DBPs of health concern (38). In fact, the highest levels of iodinated THMs occurred at a plant using chloramination with no prechlorination, and the highest concentration of dichloroacetaldehyde occurred at a plant using chloramine and ozone (38). Additionally, concentrations of trihalonitromethanes—including brominated species—appear to be increased by preozonation. At the end of the treatment, biologically active filters can be used to remove AOC, which includes aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, and certain HAAs. Because the presence of AOC in the distribution system promotes bacterial regrowth, many ozone drinking water treatment plants use biological filtration to remove this material. Greater opportunities to make drinking water as safe as possible for all consumers will come with improved understanding of formation, exposure, and health risk issues associated with DBPs. It is hoped that the next generation of DBP research will answer new questions raised by recent epidemiological studies and resolve older questions regarding the possible carcinogenicity of DBPs. Ultimately, the aim is to improve capabilities for minimizing drinking water pathogen risks, while minimizing any chemical DBPs that may pose unintended human health risks.
