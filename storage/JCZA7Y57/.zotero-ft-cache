ABSTRACT: With both catalytic and genetic functions, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is perhaps the most pluripotent chemical species in molecular biology, and its functions are intimately linked to its structure and dynamics. Computer simulations, and in particular atomistic molecular dynamics (MD), allow structural dynamics of biomolecular systems to be investigated with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We here provide a comprehensive overview of the fast-developing field of MD simulations of RNA molecules. We begin with an in-depth, evaluatory coverage of the most fundamental methodological challenges that set the basis for the future development of the field, in particular, the current developments and inherent physical limitations of the atomistic force fields and the recent advances in a broad spectrum of enhanced sampling methods. We also survey the closely related field of coarse-grained modeling of RNA systems. After dealing with the methodological aspects, we provide an exhaustive overview of the available RNA simulation literature, ranging from studies of the smallest RNA oligonucleotides to investigations of the entire ribosome. Our review encompasses tetranucleotides, tetraloops, a number of small RNA motifs, A-helix RNA, kissing-loop complexes, the TAR RNA element, the decoding center and other important regions of the ribosome, as well as assorted others systems. Extended sections are devoted to RNA−ion interactions, ribozymes, riboswitches, and protein/RNA complexes. Our overview is written for as broad of an audience as possible, aiming to provide a much-needed interdisciplinary bridge between computation and experiment, together with a perspective on the future of the field.

1. INTRODUCTION
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is one of the most important and versatile chemical species in molecular biology. According to the original central dogma of molecular biology, messenger RNA (mRNA) is an intermediary carrier of genetic
information,1 whereas transfer RNA (tRNA) is the molecular adaptor used to translate this information into a protein
sequence.2 The translation process is catalyzed by the ribosome, a large multicomponent RNA/protein complex that controls specific pairing of each mRNA with the appropriate sequence of corresponding aminoacylated tRNAs and forms the
peptide bonds of the resulting protein.3−5 Discovery of catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) in the early 1980s demonstrated that RNA
can catalyze specific chemical reactions,6 achieving accelerations
comparable to those of many protein enzymes.7 Determination
of the structure of the ribosome,3,4,8−14 and especially the large
ribosomal subunit,15 revealed that the ribosome itself is an
unusually large ribozyme.16 In addition, these atomistic structures provided a tremendous amount of information about RNA structural motifs and the principles governing RNA evolution. Retrospectively, the discovery of a multitude of
catalytic RNAs6 revolutionized modern biology, demonstrating RNA’s unique capacity to simultaneously store genetic

information (as do DNA genomes) and catalyze chemical reactions (as do protein enzymes), expanding the central dogma of molecular biology and supporting the RNA World hypothesis that RNA-based systems that bridge genotype and phenotype may have been the first forms of life to emerge on
Earth.17−19 Perhaps unsurprisingly given this functional breadth, as more genomes were sequenced over the last 20 years, many other cellular roles of RNA have been identified. In bacteria, riboswitches ubiquitously control gene expression in response
to physiological cues.20 In eukaryotic and particularly multicellular organisms, RNA is involved in numerous processes essential for the maintenance, regulation, and processing of
genetic information, such as RNA silencing.21−27 RNA can thus be broadly classified into protein-coding and noncoding RNA (ncRNA); the vast majority of RNA transcripts in human cells, numbered at least 80 000 and likely more, belong to the latter category and play fundamental roles in many regulatory processes. Consequently, information on the function of RNA is starting to have impacts well beyond fundamental research. For example, mutations in ncRNAs are involved in
cancer and other diseases,28−32 and riboswitches and other ncRNAs are emerging as attractive targets for novel anti
biotics.33−37 Because of the rapidly expanding RNA universe, the throughput of experimental tools has quickly become a limitation in our ability to dissect RNA structure−dynamics− function relationships. Computational tools can help overcome this limitation by interpreting the available experimental data, by adding connections between structure, dynamics, and function, and by generating experimentally testable hypotheses. In light of rapidly advancing computational and algorithmic powers, the impact of these tools stands only to further expand. Here, we broadly review the current state-of-the-art of computational treatments of the conformational dynamics and chemical transformations of RNA molecules. After a short introduction to RNA structure and dynamics, we will discuss
the methodological constituents of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We will start surveying the available force fields, the methods that can be used to access long time scale dynamics, and the available coarse-grained models. We will then discuss how interaction of RNA with ions can be modeled. In the second part of this Review, we will focus on applications of MD to RNA systems. We will start with simple oligonucleotides and continue surveying applications of classical MD to RNA motifs, riboswitches, ribosomes, and RNA/protein complexes. Finally, we will discuss studies of RNA reactivity.
2. PRINCIPLES OF RNA STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS
RNA is a linear polymer composed of four nucleotide monomers: A, C, G, and U. Each nucleotide consists of a planar aromatic base attached to a ribose unit, a furanose-ring sugar moiety with a 5′-phosphate group (Figure 1). RNA chains are built up by formation of phosphodiester linkages between successive sugar residues, with phosphate groups linking the 3′-carbon of each sugar to the 5′-carbon of the next one, leaving a free (unlinked) 5′-position at one end of the chain (the “5′-end”) and a free 3′-position at the other (the “3′end”). This makes RNA chains asymmetric, so 5′-ACGU-3′ and 3′-ACGU-5′ are different molecules (Figure 1). The 5′-end is considered the beginning of the chain because that is where chain synthesis begins in living organisms. 2.1. Role of the 2′-Hydroxyl Group
The 2′-OH group of the ribose moiety gives rise to profound differences between DNA and RNA. Primarily, this is because it makes RNA less chemically stable than DNA by facilitating selfcleavage reactions. As a result, DNA is better suited for stably encoding large genomes (above ∼10 000 nucleotides in length), whereas RNA is chemically more transient and thus often serves as a dynamic adaptor to changing cellular conditions. In prebiotic chemistry, the balance between RNA cleavage and ligation is assumed to have played a central role in the spontaneous untemplated assembly of the first RNAs, and

the subsequent onset of Darwinian evolution based on competition for chemical resources between sequence
variants.38 Because the 2′-OH group is a versatile hydrogen (H−) bond donor and acceptor, it enhances the ability of RNA to form complex architectures unavailable to DNA. The 2′-OH group stabilizes a broad spectrum of non-Watson−Crick
(noncanonical) base pairs39−42 not found in DNA and facilitates compact packing of RNA helices. Evolution has exploited the versatile self-interaction properties of RNA to generate an astonishing diversity of structures capable of countless specific RNA−RNA, RNA−protein, RNA−DNA, and RNA−small molecule or RNA−ion interactions.
2.2. Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary RNA Structures
RNA molecules can be described in a hierarchical manner by analyzing their primary, secondary (2D), and tertiary (3D) structures. Primary structure defines an RNA sequence in terms of its constituent nucleotides, which in addition commonly undergo post-transcriptional chemical modifications (see, e.g., ref 43). 2D structure is defined by the pattern of Watson−Crick (WC) canonical base pairs (AU and CG base pairs). These canonical base pairs are particularly stable; they stabilize
RNA duplexes by 1−3 kcal/mol per base pair.44−46 Although RNA molecules are formally single-stranded, most mixedsequence RNAs form series of short antiparallel canonical double helices by folding back upon themselves to align WCcomplementary sequences. In addition to the AU and GC base pairs, A-form double helices often contain a significant
fraction of G/U “wobble” base pairs.47 Canonical double helices alternate with regions of nucleotides that do not form canonical base pairs and so are nominally unpaired. 2D structure is therefore a summary of the adjacent canonical base pairs formed when an RNA molecule folds. Drawings representing the 2D structures often show only the nested canonical base pairs. The remaining nucleotides are frequently shown as unpaired “loops” in 2D plots. However, many of these nominally unpaired nucleotides form noncanonical base pairs. In most naturally occurring RNAs, canonical helices tend to be short, generally containing no more than around 12 consecutive canonical base pairs. Longer stretches of canonical base pairs are probably too monotonous and stable to be useful for the evolution of complex and often conformationally dynamic RNA molecules and RNA-based biomolecular machines; biologically, they are often used to
distinguish self from nonself RNA.48 Canonical helices provide a major thermodynamic contribution to RNA’s structural stability, exceeding that associated with secondary structure
formation in proteins.44−46 Building on the basic architecture defined by the 2D structure, RNA 3D structure is determined by some canonical and many noncanonical base pair interactions that often involve H-bonding through the 2′-OH group. RNA base pairs have been classified into 12 basic families of internucleoside
interactions,39−41,49 with base−sugar and sugar−sugar Hbonds being considered of importance equal to that of base− base H-bonds (Figure 2). This classification was later extended
to include sequence-specific base−phosphate interactions,50 allowing RNA base pairing to be generalized as a network of sequence-specific internucleotide interactions. This broader definition and the classification of base pairs in terms of their isostericity are crucial to understanding the evolution of RNA molecules. The powerful principle of isostericity posits that preserving the exact geometry of base pair interactions (within
double helical regions and in tertiary interactions) is a key requirement governing the evolution and covariation patterns
of RNA sequences.39−42,47,49−56 That is, it embodies the idea that 2D and mainly 3D structures dictate primary structure. In a given sequence position, functionally equivalent RNA molecules from different organisms typically only alternate base pairs of identical (isosteric) geometries; only those sequences that can fully satisfy the isostericity in a given position are selected
in the course of evolution.39,42,49,50,54,55 Although the full set of isosteric possibilities is not always exploited, violations of isostericity are rare. This is because replacing one base pair with another of a different geometry changes the overall topology of
the RNA.39−42,50 Analysis of isostericity is actually a typical application for MD simulation studies, because the technique quite reliably describes shapes of nucleobases and their interactions, allowing realistic studies of base substitutions. RNA topology is determined by the backbone path, which depends on the position and direction of the backbone
segments attached to the bases.39 This links a local property (base pair geometry) with the global topology, which determines the molecule’s biological functionality. Change in
Figure 2. There are 12 basic mutually nonisosteric families of RNA base pairs, created by utilization of the three nucleoside edges and assuming either cis or trans orientations of the glycosidic bonds. These are complemented by sequence-specific base−phosphate interactions, which involve ∼12% nucleotides in the ribosome. The figure shows the interacting edges of nucleobases (A and B) and examples of interactions between nucleosides (C, D, E, and G) and between bases

the shape of a base pair (i.e., a nonisosteric substitution) within a folded molecule changes the associated backbone path, causing ripple effects across the entire RNA structure. This is the physical reason underlying the isostericity principle. At first sight, RNA backbone appears sequence-independent and flexible. However, its flexibility is not unlimited. The backbone has a certain number of allowed rotamers (combinations of the consecutive dihedral angles along the chain) that have been classified into approximately 50 suites
(Figure 3).57 Each suite is a set of seven consecutive dihedral
angles centered on a phosphate group Pi. It links two
nucleotides, i−1 and i, in the covalent chain (the seven angles are δi−1, εi−1, ζi−1, αi, βi, γi, and δi when using the conventional
nucleotide-centered numbering or, equivalently, δi−1, εi, ζi, αi,
βi, γi, and δi when using phosphate-centered numbering).
Different suites allow diverse mutual positions of the two linked nucleosides, with the nucleobase positions being further adjusted by the χ glycosidic angles. To a first approximation, 3D structure is thus determined by a complex interplay of sequence-dependent internucleotide interactions that are modulated by intrinsically sequence-independent preferences of RNA backbone. A detailed review of this phenomenon and the associated experimental evidence has been specifically
provided elsewhere for those carrying out theoretical studies.58 The 12 base pair families are mutually nonisosteric, and, in addition, each family can be further subdivided into several
nonisosteric subfamilies.39 In a folded RNA, every single Hbond matters, and RNA structures are determined much more strictly than typical protein structures. Specifically structured RNA building blocks, or motifs, are characterized by so-called signature H-bonding and stacking interactions that are essential for their formation and dictate their underlying consensus sequences. Consequently, structures are more important and more conserved than sequences. For example, the core of the bacterial ribosome exhibits 72% conservation at the level of sequence identity, but 98% conservation at the level of
isostericity.42 This strictness of RNA structures must be taken into consideration when performing MD studies because failure to account for the isostericity principle may lead to inaccurate interpretation of simulation results (see section 4.2.1). Losses of signature interactions determined by a consensus sequence during MD simulation of a folded RNA can be a sign of structural instability resulting from the approximations of the force field.
As noted above, RNA 2D structures generally consist of short canonical helices punctuated by nominally unpaired segments that are shown as “loops” in planar 2D representations (Figure
4).41,52−54,59 2D structure loops consist of one or more strand
segments and can be classified into three basic types: (1) hairpin loops formed by single continuous strand segments folded onto themselves at ends of helices; (2) internal loops comprising two strand segments located between two helices; and (3) multihelix junctions from which three or more helices emanate; for more examples, see Figure 3 in ref 41. The term “loop” may evoke the idea of a lack of structure. However, many RNA 2D loops are precisely structured, including most
common hairpin loops.41,52−54,59,60 Nucleotides of structured loops form multiple interactions with each other, and frequently with other (distal) parts of the same RNA or with other molecules. Consequently, the sequences presented as loops in 2D diagrams are often the most interesting and functionally important components of any given RNA molecule. Many of them correspond to recurrent, highly
Figure 3. RNA backbone can adopt multiple conformations. Examples of three different conformations (conformational families) of the RNA backbone segments between two consecutive nucleotides (i.e., suites) together with the dihedral angles that define them; note that the numbering of the seven angles defining a suite is phosphate-centered; see the text. Using the notation introduced in ref 57, part (A) shows backbone of canonical A-form (family 1a) with the definition of the torsional angles, while parts (B) and (C) show the structures “found before a bulge” (family 1o) and “between the nucleotides 2 and 3 belonging to an UNCG tetraloop” (family 2[).

specific molecular building blocks and are often called “RNA
3D motifs”.41,52−55,59,61
The description of the RNA formal structures is completed by pseudoknots that result from (canonical) base pairing between a hairpin loop (or another secondary structure element) and a single distal complementary strand region.64 In topological terms, pseudoknot formation produces a long base-paired double helix, formed by the combination of two base-paired double helices, where one of the strands is continuous and the other is discontinuous, and two loops that embed the helix within the complete continuous sequence (Figure 4B). Note that by discontinuous strand we mean that the strand lacks continuous covalent bonding along the helix.
As suggested elsewhere,41 when performing computational chemistry analyses, it is instructive to think of large RNAs as toys composed of intricate, interlocking parts, like jigsaw puzzles, LEGOs, and Russian dolls. Isostericity principle and the dependence of RNA structure on precisely shaped interactions make RNA molecules akin to complex jigsaw puzzles, with natural selection favoring “pieces” that preserve the local shape. Like sophisticated LEGO toys, RNAs then often utilize recurrent modular building blocks that may be, in addition, flexible and dynamic within a given set of topological
constraints. Many of the interactions in RNA molecules encode conformational substates that are important for their functional dynamics. Finally, like Russian dolls, RNA architectures are hierarchical. Often, a given structural interaction pattern or motif (with its associated sequence signature) includes subpatterns or submotifs while also being an element of larger RNA molecules.65 Submotifs are smaller RNA segments that cannot be regarded as independent building blocks that adopt specific 3D folds independently of their context. In other words, a submotif may participate in a number of distinct motifs, and combinations of motifs are used to create larger RNA structures, with astonishing richness of combinatorial possibilities. This may complicate the definition of appropriate model systems for biologically meaningful MD simulation studies. RNA folding kinetics is hierarchical and sequential, with 2D structure folding occurring usually (but not always66) before and independently of 3D structure. This is a consequence of the high thermodynamic stability of 2D with respect to 3D contacts as well as of the fact that the canonical RNA helices are typically able to fold autonomously.67−69
Figure 5. Schematic representation of the time scales that are relevant for RNA structural dynamics. In the upper part, sample structural changes are depicted. In the lower part, the typical time scales nowadays accessible to the techniques discussed in this Review are shown, including quantum mechanical calculations, atomistic explicit-solvent MD simulations, and coarse-grained models (section 3.3). Hardware and software improvements
led to an order of magnitude gain every few years in the past. Dedicated hardware such as Anton73 allows for significantly longer time scales to be
accessed in atomistic MD, and massively parallel approaches like the folding@home infrastructure74,75 allow one to gather large cumulated simulation times (although typically composed of a large number of short trajectories). However, complex conformational changes still remain out of reach of MD simulations. Enhanced sampling techniques (section 3.2) might be used to probe those time scales. The bottom arrow shows typical free-energy barriers involved in these processes. Complex and biologically relevant molecular machines such as the ribosome utilize an endless spectrum of dynamical processes, extending from movements of single nucleotides up to large-scale movements of their whole subunits on a wide range of time scales (section 4.5.3).

2.3. RNA Dynamics
As explained above, 3D structures of RNA molecules are largely determined by their sequences. However, as will be discussed in this Review, RNA structures are not static. A single RNA molecule with a well-defined sequence often has multiple accessible 2D and 3D structures that lie within a narrow range of folding free energies and are sampled as a consequence of thermal fluctuations or interactions with proteins and other cofactors that induce or capture specific RNA conformations. The time scales over which these alternate structures form and disappear can range from microseconds for simple base pairing changes to seconds (or even longer) for complex 2D refolding
events (Figure 5).70−72 Because RNA molecules often play multiple roles in biological processes, their native states can be anything from firmly structured folded architectures to intrinsically disordered dynamical single-stranded ensembles. Despite the tremendous importance of RNA structural dynamics, its experimental characterization is even more challenging than obtaining static structural data. Thus, there have been intense efforts to complement the available experimental techniques by advanced MD simulation approaches. The main goals of atomistic MD simulations are (a) to simulate the structural dynamics of RNA molecules explicitly and in real time to support the interpretation and planning of experimental measurements of such dynamics; (b) to provide reliable and experimentally testable predictions; and (c) to furnish insights that are not obtainable by current experimental methods but which help explain RNA’s multitudinous functional roles. As we will discuss, the approximations required in MD sometimes do not allow experimental data to be quantitatively reproduced or predicted. Even in such cases, simulations can still be extremely useful in guiding chemical and physical intuition to design new experiments. Carefully designed MD simulations may often prevent incorrect interpretations of experimental data. MD simulations may be complemented by quantum mechanical (QM) calculations, which can be used to assess the likelihood of specific chemical reaction pathways involving RNA enzymes and to thereby inspire new experimental tests or help interpret existing experimental data on RNA catalysis (section 4.8). Nowadays, QM calculations are often interfaced with molecular mechanical (MM) treatments of distal layers of the RNA that are not directly involved in forming or breaking covalent bonds, to provide context and to capture the impact of conformational dynamics on the reaction probed by QM. QM methods are also indispensable for the parameterization of the MM force fields used in MD simulations (section 3.1). Moreover, larger scale dynamics and conformational changes not accessible via conventional atomistic MD simulations can be studied using various coarse-grained methods, all to be summarized here.
3. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION METHODOLOGIES
3.1. RNA Force Field
The main factor limiting accuracy of MD simulations is the molecular mechanical (MM) force field that defines the relationship between the simulated molecule’s exact geometry and its potential energy. Negative gradient of the MM potential energy defines a force for every possible Cartesian configuration of the system. To avoid confusion, we recall that molecular mechanics (MM) here indicates that the forces are computed using some empirical force field, in opposition to quantum
mechanics (QM), whereas molecular dynamics (MD) indicates that time-dependence of the atomic positions is simulated.
3.1.1. Basic Force-Field Approximation. When assessing a force field, one must consider its basic approximation separately from its specific parameterization. The basic approximation determines the principal physical limits of a given force-field form. The basic physical limits of MM are very substantial, but their consequences for practical simulations are unknowable a priori and so must be determined by performing simulations of diverse systems. Within these basic limits, one tries to tune the force field via specific parameterizations to obtain the best possible performance for RNA molecules. As one approaches the basic limits of the force-field form, improvements in individual components will increasingly conflict with one another such that improving one aspect of the force field may have adverse effects on other aspects that outweigh the gains. There are a variety of strategies for improving parameterizations (see below), but when applying any such strategy it is important to remember that most critical is the force field’s empirical performance in MD simulations. A force field’s performance across a set of systems will not be uniform, and will depend on its parameterization and on the extent to which compensation of errors occurs for the systems under consideration. The applicability of a given force-field version may vary between simulated biomolecules, and even between different parts of a single simulated molecule. A textbook example can be found in G-quadruplexes, whose single-stranded loops are described less accurately than the Gstems.76,77 Improvement of force fields requires the open reporting and analysis of their failures. Unfortunately, many MD publications show a notable reluctance to report force-field failures, and to discuss limitations. This reluctance is rather notorious even in some high-impact journals, especially in short-communication-style papers, because nowadays many such journals seem to strongly prefer short papers that describe “flawless”, “hot” research while sidelining conservative works. 3.1.1.1. Force-Field Functional Form. At present, the vast majority of RNA simulations are performed using nonpolarizable force fields whose form is simple and has remained essentially unchanged for several decades (see also ref 78). A notable example is the form used in the force fields of the AMBER simulation package,79 which are based on the work of Cornell et al. (eq 1).80 This form describes the covalent connectivity of the investigated system using a set of harmonic springs representing bond lengths and valence angles with force constants kb and ka, and equilibrium values req and θeq, respectively, supplemented with sums of dihedral terms characterized by an amplitude Vn, periodicity n, and phase γ. While it would be possible to add higher-order terms to better represent coupled dynamics such as bend−stretch coupling and nonharmonic terms, such a refinement appears unnecessary for biological molecules. Adding higher-order terms would also complicate the parameterization. A consequence of the harmonic covalent bond description is, however, that covalent bond breaking and formation (i.e., chemical reactions) cannot be simulated.

Interatomic interactions are approximated by using LennardJones spheres to represent atomic repulsions and dispersion attraction (parameters used for this purpose are the equilibrium interatomic van der Waals (vdW) distance Ri0j and the potential
well depth εij in eq 1). Coulombic term is represented by point charges (qi in eq 1). The charges are localized at the atomic
centers and have fixed values; that is, they do not change upon molecule conformational changes and do not respond to external electric fields, including those stemming from solvation. In eq 1, r, θ, φ, and Rij stand for bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles, and interatomic distances, respectively. This is the simplest meaningful form for an atomistic empirical potential. Notably, it lacks an explicit term for the polarization energy. Polarizable force fields (i.e., force fields with explicit polarization terms) would have the advantage of being able to reflect the distribution of polarization effects in the studied system. While promising polarizable models are being developed for DNA simula
tions,81−83 there are currently no polarizable potentials for
RNA simulations in the CHARMM84 or AMBER79 force-field families. In addition, despite tremendous efforts, the accuracy of polarizable DNA force fields does not currently surpass that of the best pair-additive alternatives, suggesting that tuning polarizable force fields will be a tedious task whose difficulty is comparable to that of tuning fast QM methods for
biomolecular computations.85,86 We therefore focus on nonpolarizable RNA force fields in the following discussion. Still, we consider the development of polarizable force fields to be of utmost importance because, in our opinion, pair-additive force fields are reaching the limits of their capabilities and are starting to restrict our ability to fully exploit continuing advances in computer power and sampling methods when studying nucleic acids. The force-field description in nonpolarizable force fields is unphysical and, by definition, neglects many effects (such as all types of polarization and charge-transfer effects) by definition. Because these force fields ignore all nonadditive contributions, they are called “pairwise additive force fields”. The neglected contributions are in part effectively (implicitly) accounted for in the parameters of the explicit force-field terms, mainly the partial charges, so that such force fields are also called “effective force fields”. A large part of the neglected contributions is compensated for by tuning of dihedral force-field terms.
3.1.1.2. Fitting the Parameters. Bond and angle parameters can be derived from equilibrium distances and angles observed in X-ray diffraction data, while microwave and IR spectroscopies can be used to obtain stretching and bending force constants. The bonded terms can also be derived via high-level QM reference data. vdW radii and well depths can be derived
by matching experimental densities and heats of vaporization,87 benchmark electronic structure calculations, and/or through ad hoc assumptions. There are two commonly used approaches for parameterizing the electrostatic term: (i) parameterizing the atomic charges through fits to QM-derived electrostatic
potentials (ESP),80,88 as ESP fits are typically used for AMBER force fields, or (ii) by fitting the force field to
reproduce QM computations of interaction energies for small molecular fragments interacting with ligands such as water molecules, as employed in the parameterization of CHARMM
force fields.89 ESP-based methods originally used simple ESP fits. Later, improved ESP protocols were introduced, including restrained ESP (RESP) fits to eliminate spurious effects such as
artificial growth in the charges of buried atoms.88,90 Artifacts arising from the orientation of rotatable groups may be
suppressed by utilization of multiple conformations for fitting.91 The most arbitrary task in force-field parameterization is the
fitting of the dihedral potentials.92−98 Note that the dihedral terms, despite often being fitted with the help of QM potentialenergy scans, are not related to any real electronic structure effects and thus represent ad hoc functions used for the final tuning of the force-field behavior. Dihedral parameterizations have very large impacts on the simulations, as demonstrated by the RNA glycosidic potential χ: small changes in the shape of the χ potential in the anti to high-anti regions can have
dramatic effects on RNA simulations (Figure 6).94 An inappropriate parameterization may completely destabilize the
native A-RNA structure (giving rise to ladder-like artifacts99 in some cases, cf., Figure 7) because of cumulative effects in
longer RNA sequences.94 Consequently, most refinements of established force fields for nucleic acids as well as proteins have been based on modifications of the dihedral potentials. Because the parameters of dihedral potentials are fitted after all of the other parameters, any significant change in the other terms would require a subsequent retuning of the existing dihedral potentials. Presently, dihedral potentials consist of one-dimensional potential energy profiles along individual torsions, so there is no explicit coupling between torsions. Although several parameterization procedures that will be discussed later (see section 3.1.2.2) allow multiple torsions to be simultaneously parameterized, the final potential is still a sum of 1D profiles. However, in real molecules, the neighboring torsions are nontrivially coupled through electron density redistributions upon rotations, which would imply nonadditivity of dihedral parameters. Studies on the importance of these nonadditivities are rare. It has been shown that the magnitude of dihedral nonadditivity in dimethylphosphate can be as large as 1 kcal/
mol.102 An efficient way to overcome the lack of nonadditivity that has been incorporated into the CHARMM protein force field is a grid-based two-dimensional energy correction map
(CMAP).96,103 CMAP was designed to account for nonadditivity of the neighboring torsions observed in QM calculations. However, final CMAP corrections for proteins were obtained by empirically adjusting the map such that the MD simulations reproduce experimental data. CMAP was
introduced to better describe protein backbones,96,103 and proved useful for accurately simulating proteins using
CHARMM force fields.97 Interestingly, CMAP-type corrections are not used to model DNA and RNA even in the latest CHARMM36 and CHARMM polarizable nucleic acid force
fields,81,98 which may indicate that such corrections are either not vitally important in nucleic acid simulations or do not appreciably improve performance or are too difficult to parameterize. The AMBER force fields, which are often considered to provide more accurate descriptions of DNA and RNA molecules than other alternatives, do not include any CMAP-type corrections.
3.1.1.3. Physical Limitations. Although the force-field terms look intuitive, they are in fact unphysical, even though they are

motivated by physics. For instance, Coulomb’s law is fully physical, but the atomic charges used in the force-field formulas are not observables as there is no QM operator for atomic charges. Thus, they cannot be derived from the first-principles of quantum mechanics, and they are not measurable by any (even hypothetical) experiments. Partial atomic charges are entirely arbitrary quantities that do not exist in nature. It is therefore pointless to discuss the values of individual atomic charges, although such discussions do occasionally appear in the literature. However, the complete set of atomic charges of a given molecular fragment can be tuned to reproduce the ESP around the fragment or some other real physical property of interest. ESP is an unambiguously defined physical property of the molecule that in principle is measurable. Use of ESP fitting of atomic charges is probably one of the key reasons for the success of the AMBER nucleic acid force fields based on the seminal 1995 parameterization of Cornell et
al.80 ESP charges lead to a very good description of the
electrostatic contributions to H-bonding and stacking inter
actions, as demonstrated by QM benchmark calculations.104 This is because bases are generally flat and rigid, with the exception of pyramidalization of amino groups, an effect not
accounted for in the parameterization.105,106 However, success of ESP charges for base−base interactions is not transferable to the description of nucleic acid backbone due to its flexibility. In addition, the backbone is a polyanion, which further complicates its description. A given fixed set of backbone point charges cannot simultaneously describe the ESPs for different nucleic acid backbone conformers (backbone families). This problem is especially severe for RNA, which has dozens of biochemically relevant backbone families (Figure
3).57 Attempts to resolve this issue by basing the ESP fits on weighted averages of multiple conformations have not
improved performance,58,85 and a better description of the RNA backbone will probably require use of a polarizable force field or some kind of conformation-dependent electrostatic term. It thus appears that a balanced description of diverse nucleic acid backbone families perhaps cannot even be obtained simply by tuning dihedral potentials. Similarly, despite seeming well-defined at first glance, atomic radii are purely arbitrary parameters. The apparent “size” of an atom depends on its chemical environment, which affects its electronic structure. The force-field radius of an atom is an empirical parameter that is selected as the best compromise with which to describe molecular interactions in different chemical situations. For example, a hydrogen atom attached to an H-bond donor looks very small (hidden inside the H-bond donor and having zero radius) when involved in an H-bond but
large when pointing toward a nonpolar chemical group.107

the RNA χOL3 glycosidic potential94 and the original ff9990 parameters. Small changes in the anti and high-anti regions (i.e., tuning of the dihedral profile between ∼180° and 260°) have major effects on the simulations. The χOL3 refinement successfully prevents the simulated molecules from adopting spurious ladder-like structures (Figure 7); the ladder is more stable than A-RNA with the original force field. Importantly, χOL3 minimizes adverse flattening of the A-RNA due to
reduction of the inclination when refining the anti and high-anti χ regions, which is a problem of some other χ angle modifications (for more details, see sections 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.2, and 3.1.2.3). (Bottom) χOL4

Therefore, any parameterization with fixed radii is necessarily a crude compromise; real atoms are not van der Waals spheres. This unphysicality is why the point charges and atomic radii of a given atom in different force fields can differ significantly, and there is no way of determining a priori which of them is more realistic. Dihedral potentials may be considered the perhaps most unphysical part of a force field. These formally intramolecular terms are used to compensate for major flaws in
the description of the intermolecular nonbonded terms.94 Limitations of the force-field description can be demonstrated by comparing MM and QM calculations, because the latter can be considered to reflect properties of real molecular fragments. MM and QM (i.e., real) molecules are very different objects. For example, base pair formation at the MM level is a result of complementarity of the unperturbed ESPs, balanced against the vdW Waals term. Real base pairing is a rich phenomenon involving mutual electronic structure redistributions (adaptations) of the interacting bases and communication between their molecular orbitals. Hallmark of H-bonding between bases is the elongation of the X−H covalent bonds in the H-bond donor by up to ∼0.04 Å, clearly demonstrating a
change in the electronic structure.108 Existing force-field terms cannot reproduce such changes in the electronic and geometric structures of the interacting monomers; the MM bases are excessively rigid. Although force fields do allow for some elongation of the X−H bonds, its origin is different from that in the QM description of real H-bonds. In the MM description, X−H elongations arise only from the electrostatic interactions in the point charge approximation, which are counterbalanced by the harmonic springs used to model the X-H bonds. In addition, in the course of MD simulations, the X−H elongations are usually completely eliminated by rigid
constraints109 to enable larger integration time steps, further compromising the MM description of H-bonding; for an illustration of MM and QM/MM descriptions of H-bonding at protein/RNA interface, see ref 110. Further, the monomers in base pairs come into such close proximity that divergence from the MM point charge model may become a significant
problem.111 The lack of physicality in the description of Hbonding is a major problem when balancing the different types of H-bonds that exist in RNAs, the impact of which has only recently been recognized. Another notorious problem in MM simulations of RNA relates to the inclusion of divalent ions, because real divalent ions are hubs for major networks of polarization/charge-transfer effects that significantly influence the electronic structures of all molecules in their first ligand shell and propagate further into the surrounding environment (see section 3.4.2). The currently used force-field approximations neglect all of these effects. Importantly, the statement that force fields are unphysical says nothing about their ability, after suitable calibration, to mimic certain physical properties of the studied systems. The only thing that matters in this respect is the final performance of the complete force field. However, the lack of a physical basis means that a given type of a force field has certain principal accuracy limits beyond which further tuning becomes impractical. This explains why improvements in force fields have so slowly and intermittently arisen over the last two decades, contrasting the steady and very substantial improvements in QM methodologies. Simplicity of force fields affects the flexibility of simulated RNA molecules. Their harmonic terms and pair-additivity produce potential energy surfaces with considerably less
flexibility than those derived from the wave functions of the QM description. Thus, while we cannot currently directly compare MM and QM simulations of nucleic acids, we would expect MD simulations to underestimate the richness of the local dynamics within a given conformational basin when compared to real (QM) molecules. The previously discussed deformation of monomers upon H-bonding illustrates this point. This is consistent with the available QM calculations on
nucleic acid building blocks,86,112−114 the stiffness of B-DNA in
ultralong MD simulations,115 and the increased flexibility observed in MD simulations of proteins using polarizable
force fields.116 However, despite their lack of local flexibility, classical force fields may paradoxically cause an excess of flexibility in the sampling of different substates on the folding landscape. A hallmark of reported folding simulations on tetranucleotides and tetraloops (see sections 4.1, 4.2.2.3, and 4.2.2.4) is the coexistence of many different conformations with significant populations, which is not generally supported by experiments. This may indicate that the force field is not only unable to find the correct native basins, but also predicts too many simultaneously populated structures; it appears that current force fields tend not to adequately separate the global minimum from the rest of the folding landscape for many systems, although more research will be needed to confirm this observation. A key question is “can we improve MD simulations by making the force-field form more physical?” Natural candidates
for such advancement are polarizable force fields.81−83 However, the answer is not straightforward. In general, a more complex force field is more difficult to balance. It therefore remains to be seen whether the much-needed polarizable force fields will yield the desired improvements in simulation quality; their complexity may simply increase the occurrence of conflicting imbalances on the potential energy surfaces without adequately improving the physicality of the description. This risk is underscored by the notoriously poor performance of fast low-cost QM methods for biomolecular
fragments.85,86 Despite their weaknesses, we suggest that the atomistic forcefield simulations will remain the only viable computational technique for studying the atomistic structural dynamics of biomolecules for the foreseeable future. It is not even clear that more sophisticated polarizable force fields will surpass the performance of pair-additive force fields. On the other hand, coarse-grained methods (see section 3.3), while able to provide important insights, will always lack the atomistic resolution required in many analyses, especially for RNA with its rich spectrum of functionally and evolutionarily important interactions (see section 2.2). On the other hand, despite the impressive development of QM methods in recent decades, good quality QM methods remain prohibitively slow. Attempts to use QM calculations to study large blocks of nucleic acids (4−11 nucleotides) revealed that series of gradient optimizations in either implicit solvent or explicit solvent modeled using QM/MM methods are generally not sufficient to study the relative energies of different RNA or DNA conformations, even
when using high-quality QM methods.86,113,114 Although new insights were obtained in some cases, the calculations were typically affected by substantial noise in the calculated energies
due to the complexity of the potential energy surface.117 A point that is not always acknowledged in the QM literature is that potential energies cannot be unambiguously linked to free

energies, as the latter require Boltzmann sampling (averaging);
see also section 4.3.3.118,119 The sampling problem in large-scale QM calculations is in fact reminiscent of problems with early MM calculations before the arrival of MD. In addition, testing of available fast (lowcost) QM methods has shown that they are in many respects less accurate than well-calibrated force fields for studying
nucleic acid fragments.85,86 Because low-cost QM methods are also still much slower than force field calculations, it is not clear whether any low-cost QM method will be able to achieve satisfactory sampling in the foreseeable future. These issues underscore the point that the different available computational methods each have their own advantages, limitations, and ranges of applicability, and thus complement each other. An obvious question is “what are the most serious problems affecting the performance of current RNA force fields?” Several answers have been suggested. It is possible that the conceptual underpinnings of fixed-charge models make them incapable of
correctly describing different RNA backbone families.58,85 In addition, the backbone is anionic, and anions are polarizable species because their electron clouds extend far away from their atomic nuclei. This point is supported by several QM
benchmark studies.58,85 Another problem could be over
stabilization of base stacking,120−122 although an unambiguous comparison with experiments is difficult due to mutual inconsistency in the experimental stacking free-energy
data.122,123 Overstabilization of stacking may be surprising at first glance because QM benchmark studies suggest that the AMBER parameterization offers quite good description for base
stacking.104,119 However, quantitative QM benchmarks indicate that the AMBER force field may indeed somewhat overestimate
the energetics of base stacking.124 It is nevertheless important to emphasize that QM calculations characterize the accuracy of a force field in terms of its ability to reproduce the direct (intrinsic) stacking interaction between two nucleobases, that
is, the potential energy of stacking in the absence of other
molecules.118,119 In contrast, the stability of stacking in MD simulations is determined from the populations of stacked and unstacked conformations, and thus the free energies of
stacking.119 The free energies of stacking depend on several factors, including the balance between the intrinsic stacking energies and the solvation energies. When considering all of the available data, it is becoming evident that force fields have difficulties with properly balancing hydration against the diverse interactions that are important in RNA molecules such as stacking, base pairing, and many other types of H-bonds (such as base−phosphate interactions). As a result, some interactions appear to be understabilized while others are overstabilized. Moreover, the degree of over- or understabilization may be nonuniform and context-dependent. A concomitant effect of the overall lack of balance is sensitivity
of nucleic acid simulations to the chosen water model.125,126 This has prompted suggestions that the key to better nucleic acid simulations could be to develop better parameterizations
of water models.125,126 While we readily acknowledge the importance of good water models, we do not believe that tuning water models alone will be sufficient to significantly improve the performance of nucleic acids force fields because existing water models suffer from all of the inherent limitations of the pair-additive approach. It is difficult to imagine that their refinement could fully compensate for the intrinsic inaccuracies of the solute biomolecular force field. For example, while the
OPC water model127 was shown to somewhat improve the
simulations of RNA tetranucleotides126 and free-energy
computations of stacking in nicked B-DNA,125 the same water model appears to worsen the structural stability of short
G-quadruplex stems.128 The force-field inaccuracies are caused by a number of mutually interrelated problems. In view of all of the approximations, it was suggested that general force-field refinements could be complemented by

structure-specific force-field modifications targeting selected RNA molecules (see the hydrogen-bond fix potential in section
3.1.2.5).129
3.1.2. AMBER Nucleic Acid Force Fields. Most widely used nucleic acid force fields are based on the seminal Cornell
et al. AMBER 1995 parameterization,80 which is commonly abbreviated as ff94. The success of this force field stems from its parameterization of the electrostatic term by fitting the charges to reproduce the electrostatic potential around nucleic acid building blocks (section 3.1.1.3). It was later modified, yielding
the ff98130 and ff9990 variants, by slightly tuning the pucker and χ dihedral profiles (Table 1, see also Figure 3 in ref 78). The prime purpose of these modifications was to eliminate the under-twisting of B-DNA observed with ff94, but the changes were only moderately successful in this respect. Nevertheless, many subsequent reparameterizations took ff99 as their starting point rather than ff94. Long simulations have shown that the ff94−ff99 force fields do not provide acceptably stable DNA and RNA trajectories. While most older studies were unaffected by this problem because of their short time scales, some papers have inevitably presented results based on corrupted trajectories that were either not noticed or not reported by the authors. Increasing awareness of these problems prompted two key refinements of the AMBER dihedral potentials.
3.1.2.1. Toward Basic Stability of DNA and RNA Simulations: bsc0 and χOL3 Refinements. The 2007 bsc0
version95 of the AMBER force field reparameterized the α/γ dihedrals to prevent the collapse of B-DNA due to the accumulation of irreversible non-native γ-trans backbone dihedral states (cf., Figure 4 in ref 95). Omission of the bsc0 correction in DNA simulations inevitably leads to formation of major artifacts on a time scale of ∼10 ns. Regarding A-RNA, the γ-trans states formed only reversibly when using the original force field, but upon forming they temporarily and severely
reduced the system’s helical twist.131 The bsc0 reparameterization disfavors this behavior and is therefore also beneficial for RNA simulations. While it probably overpenalizes the γ-trans backbone substates in many RNA structures, no better α/γ
correction has yet been proposed.132
The 2010 χOL3 RNA-specific correction94,133 reparameterized
the χ dihedral to suppress anti to high-anti χ shifts in RNA, which (among other problems) caused simulated molecules to undergo sudden irreversible transitions into entirely untwisted
ladder-like structures (Figures 7 and 8).94,99,133,134 These RNA ladders usually form more slowly than γ-trans artifacts in BDNA. However, the χ imbalance becomes detrimental in long RNA simulations and studies on folding. For instance, a folded
riboswitch collapsed within ∼0.5 μs134 (Figure 8), and ladders
form even more rapidly in simulated tetraloops.133 The χOL3 version also improves the description of the RNA syn region and the syn/anti balance. Achieving an accurate balance of the syn/anti/high-anti regions in the force field required consideration of conformation-dependent solvation effects in the
course of parameterization;135 this novel approach was first
applied in the derivation of the χOL3 potential.94
3.1.2.2. Other RNA Dihedral Potential Reparameterizations. The χ reparameterization of Yildirim et al. (χYIL),136 which was originally designed to correct the syn/anti balance on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, has achieved performance similar to that of χOL3. It was also later
shown to eliminate ladder formation.137 However, it slightly over-destabilizes the high-anti region (to a greater degree than
χOL3) and rather considerably reduces the inclination of A
RNA.137 The original χYIL force-field version excluded the bsc0 correction, which might be considered suboptimal. Subsequent
AMBER99TOR version138 reparameterized the remaining β, ε, and ζ dihedrals, which (if combined with the bsc0 α/γ correction) would yield a force field with completely reparameterized RNA dihedrals. Unfortunately, AMBER99TOR performs suboptimally for A-RNA (see Figure 12 in ref 58). Alternative RNA force-field dihedral potential modifications have been proposed. First, Gil-Ley et al. made an attempt to fit dihedral potentials based on the distribution of dihedral angles
taken from a database of crystallographic structures143 (see section 4.1). Second, Cesari et al. used a maximum entropy approach to fit some of the backbone torsions to solution-phase
experimental data,144 with promising results. In particular, the force field was trained to reproduce NMR data for nucleosides and dinucleoside monophosphates. The number of parameters used in the fit was significantly smaller than the number of available experimental data points to avoid overfitting. The corrections were then validated on tetranucleotides, resulting also in this case in an improved agreement with NMR experimental data. Notably, both the training and the validation
Figure 8. Simulations of preQ1 riboswitch aptamer starting from an Xray structure upon removal of the ligand, showing the most severe artifacts that may occur in RNA MD simulations. While the χOL3 force
field shows a stable trajectory with just local dynamics, the ff99 simulation collapses to the ladder-like structure (the bsc0 correction would not improve this behavior) and the CHARMM27 simulation experiences extended fraying; the latter behavior was only partly corrected by CHARMM36. The difference between the χOL3
simulation and the experimental structure reflects an intricate mixture of genuine dynamics of the system, effects due to removal of crystal packing deformations, and contributions from more subtle force-field imbalances.

were performed using as reference solution NMR data, which is expected to describe structural dynamics of flexible motifs better than an individual crystallographic structure. Lack of NMR data for the phosphate conformation makes it difficult to train and assess the torsional potential for α and ζ angles. Possible problems in these torsions might be related to the occurrence of intercalated structures in simulations of tetranucleotides (see section 4.1). Third, a simultaneous reparameterization of most of the backbone dihedrals (α, β, γ, ε, ζ, χ) was performed by Aytenfisu et al., based on QM calculations on a training set of structures extracted from the PDB. Their modifications were tested on selected tetraloops,
tetranucleotides, and RNA duplexes, with promising results,141 albeit with only limited sampling of the tetranucleotide simulations. A particularly interesting aspect of all of these works is that all dihedral potentials were fitted simultaneously, at variance with the usual procedure where one dihedral angle at a time is modified. None of these new modifications has yet been tested extensively, and so all of these force fields should be considered experimental and only used with this caveat in mind. The same holds also for the subsequent attempt to
modify the α/γ potential.145
3.1.2.3. The Split between DNA and RNA Force Fields. The bsc0 and χOL3 corrections are presently the most salient
modifications of the original ff94 force field, and have positive synergistic effects when applied to RNA simulations. However, the χOL3 refinement cannot be used for DNA because RNA and
DNA have conflicting requirements on the χ potential in the most critical anti to high-anti region. This divergence necessitated the development of separate Cornell et al.-based force-field variants for simulating DNA and RNA. χOL4
parameterization (DNA χ dihedral, published in 2012, Figure
6)100 is the DNA counterpart of χOL3, which improves the
behavior of canonical and noncanonical DNAs. εζOL1 (ε and ζ,
2013) parameters146 were introduced to tune the BI/BII populations in B-DNA, and ultimately corrected the B-DNA helical twist, which was described incorrectly by earlier force fields. εζOL1 was also reported to improve description of the
structural dynamics of the hairpin ribozyme’s catalytic
center,147 although other tests have shown that it worsens the description of some other RNAs. We therefore do not
recommend its use in RNA simulations.132 Bsc1 (which combines bsc0 with reparameterized pucker, χ, ε, and ζ
dihedrals; 2015)148 is another DNA-specific dihedral reparameterization that achieves performance similar to that of bsc0εζOL1χOL4. This force field is also not recommended for use
with RNA. The final reparameterization of the AMBER
dihedrals for DNA was βOL1 (β dihedral, 2015),149 which is
especially useful for noncanonical DNAs. The (ff99)bsc0βOL1εζOL1χOL4 force field has been abbreviated as OL15, and represents a complete reparameterization of the DNA dihedral potentials as compared to the original ff94 version. Among the various dihedral refinements of the original ff94 force field, bsc0 and χOL3 stand out because they are critical for stabilizing DNA and RNA simulations, respectively. Reparameterizations of the remaining dihedrals achieved some additional improvements for DNA, and OL15 probably represents the upper limit of what can be achieved by reparameterizing uncoupled dihedrals for DNA. Despite these improvements, the force field is far from flawless. For RNA, the combination of χOL3 and bsc0 appears to be the best compromise at present because (as noted above) the available reparameterizations of other dihedrals may have undesirable
side effects. The fact that state-of-the-art force fields for RNA and DNA require different dihedral parameters is a further confirmation that these parameters are nonphysical and only used to compensate errors arising from other missing interactions. For instance, the atoms involved in the glycosidic torsion are expected to be chemically equivalent in RNA and DNA.
3.1.2.4. Toward Tuning of the Nonbonded Terms. Further tuning of the force field would require modification of the nonbonded terms and consideration of better solvent models. As a first attempt in this direction, Chen and Garcia modified the balance between stacking, H-bonding, and solvation. This involved (i) rescaling the vdW parameters of the nucleobases, and (ii) adjustment of vdW combination rules for base-water
interactions (nonbonded fix, NBfix).120 The main aim was to eliminate the overstabilization of stacking. It was accompanied by a modification of the χ dihedral potential resembling those by χOL3 and χYIL; the bsc0 α/γ refinement was excluded (Figure
9). The modified force field offered partial improvements in
simulations of RNA tetraloops, albeit of a lesser magni
tude129,139 than was originally suggested,120 and some side
effects have been later reported (see section 4.2.2.3).139,140 While the NBfix procedure may seem unphysical, it is entirely justified because NBfix increases the scope for tuning the force field’s overall performance by balancing the treatment of solvation effects.

Another work considering alternative vdW parameters was
published by Bergonzo et al.126,139 Instead of a new reparameterization, the authors opted to test alternative
phosphate parameters proposed by Steinbrecher et al.150 in
combination with the OPC water model.127 Steinbrecher’s parameters were originally derived for bioinorganic phos
phates.150 Bergonzo et al. showed that using the larger, less hydrophilic phosphate groups described by these parameters
yielded a better description of tetranucleotides126 and
tetraloops.139 The Steinbrecher phosphate parameters were
also used by Darré et al.151 in a different way, in conjunction with abandoning the Lorentz−Berthelot combination rules for the Lennard-Jones potential. The simulations showed a slightly better description of tetranucleotides than reported by
Bergonzo et al.139 In addition, Darré et al. modified also the torsional parameters of the C2′−OH group of ribose. However, the latter modification seems to have only marginal effects on the simulations, which become apparent after detailed scrutiny
of the published data. Yang et al.152 also replaced the Lorentz− Berthelot combination rules with a specific phosphate (OP) oxygen parameterization (along with an O2′ adjustment), with similarly good results in tetranucleotide simulations. However, none of these modifications were tested on a broad range of RNA structures, and their general applicability remains to be determined. In summary, most attempts to modify the vdW terms have required simultaneous modification of the vdW combination rules. It is therefore not clear whether RNA simulations can be improved by tuning the vdW term alone without using additional tricks such as NBfix, which effectively increase the number of parameters that can be tuned. In addition, none of the reported attempts seems to have yielded a real breakthrough in the quality of RNA simulations.
3.1.2.5. Structure-Specific Modifications. In addition to attempts to improve the general parameterization of the RNA force field, simulations of specific systems can be improved by
structure-specific force-field modifications.129 The goal of such modifications is to correct specific weaknesses of the force field while avoiding undesired side effects. The HBfix method (not to be confused with the NBfix-type modifications discussed above) adds a local spherical auxiliary potential supporting
native hydrogen bonds.129 Such local potentials do not affect the ensemble except for a rather narrow part of the configuration space where the heavy-atom distances of hydrogen donor−acceptor pairs lie within a given range (e.g., 3−4 Å in the original work). HBfix only indirectly promotes forward folding (corresponding to kon in experiments) but directly increases the lifetime of folded structures (i.e., reduces koff). In effect, the potential compensates for the unmodified
force field’s inability to describe the electron-redistribution effects that accompany real H-bonding for a list of a priori chosen interactions that are present in the native structure. Note that when utilizing structure-specific potentials, one is typically limited by the functions that are implemented in the simulation codes; in practice, HBfix is constructed as a linear combination of two standard restraints. For this reason, HBfix has been so far implemented in a way that does not account for
the directionality of the H-bonds.129 The short-range HBfix bias is much milder than commonly used tools such as restraints, targeted MD, Go̅-type
potentials,153 and other brute-force approaches for forcing simulations to sample desired (target) structures. The amount of energy included to stabilize each native H-bond in the HBfix
in ref 129 is indeed on the order of the thermal energy kBT, that is similar to the bias used in Go̅ model potentials. However, in
Go̅ models all of the native contacts are stabilized, whereas in
the HBfix approach only a selected number of contacts are stabilized. For instance, the typical number of hydrogen bonds stabilized in an 8-mer including a GAGA tetraloop in the HBfix
approach would be 9.129 In an atomistic Go̅ model simulation
for the same system, the number of native contacts would be
approximately 100.153 In addition, Go̅ models are not used
within the framework of explicit solvent environment. Simulations using HBfix with 1 kcal/mol support per H-bond added to the χOL3 force field successfully folded the GAGA
tetraloop, retaining all of its signature interactions.129 HBfix also successfully stabilized simulations of the U1A protein/RNA
complex.154 Note that the HBfix potential can also be used to destabilize selected H-bond interactions if they are overstabilized. Obviously, the use of structure-specific force-field adjustments may seem unsatisfactory. However, pragmatic use of such biases is legitimate, and, due to the persistent performance problems of the general force fields, their use may become increasingly common, or even inevitable. We suggest that the best approach is to first try to achieve the best possible performance with the general force field. Once one has then reached the point at which further tuning is unproductive, the native state(s) can be supported with gentle structurespecific biases rather than continuing with cumbersome forcefield refinements that may cause many undesired side effects. In addition, in principle, the HBfix type of potential could be generalized in an interaction-specific manner.
3.1.3. CHARMM RNA Force Fields. CHARMM is another major MM potential that was systematically developed for simulating biomacromolecules, including nucleic acids. The
latest version is CHARMM36,98 and earlier versions are known
as CHARMM2789,155,156 and CHARMM22.157 Despite its common use to study RNA, its performance has not been as thoroughly and systematically tested as that of the AMBER RNA force fields; literature discussions of limitations of RNA force fields based on the work of Cornell et al. appear to be more systematic than those of the CHARMM derivatives. Several groups have reported that CHARMM27 underestimates base pairing stability in A-RNA and may even lead to
uncontrollable helix fraying (Figure 8);134,158−160 some groups switched from using CHARMM to AMBER during their
ongoing RNA projects.158,161,162 Conversely, other groups have used this force field for RNA simulations without reporting any problems. It is not clear whether these contrasting reports reflect the use of somewhat different force-field implementations (including a possible difference between periodic boundary and solvent sphere computations; see section 4.5.3) or whether some groups used unreported means such as restraints to stabilize their simulations. The instability of ARNA in CHARMM27 simulations was addressed by the
CHARMM36 reparameterization,98 which modified the 2′-OH ribose dihedral potential because the stability problem was attributed to an inappropriate orientation of the 2′-OH groups. The robustness of this refinement is not yet fully clear; in our opinion, it has reduced but not eliminated the tendency toward fraying. As we noted in several other places of this review (e.g., section 4.2.2.3), we suspect that even the AMBER force field underestimates strength of the base pairing, due to the lack of inclusion of electronic structure redistributions, which actually has been the reason for introducing the HBfix approach
(section 3.1.2.5).129 It should be noted that in some cases the

lower structural stability of simulations can even be quite useful to speed up conformational changes, by reducing barriers between different parts of the folding landscape. However, there is always a potential risk that such structural changes may not be fully realistic. We reiterate that the CHARMM forcefield developers are currently leading the efforts to derive
polarizable force fields for nucleic acids.81−83
3.1.4. Force-Field Validation by Reweighting. A very important issue closely related to the development of new force fields is their validation. In general, as we discussed, classical force fields contain nonphysical terms that might predict correct relative stabilities of multiple conformers as a consequence of error cancellation. This makes it very difficult to validate the force field from an ab initio perspective, by using
for example QM benchmarks.85 A usual way to assess the quality of a force field is thus testing it within an MD simulation and comparing results directly with experimental data. When possible, this comparison should be made in situations where the MD trajectory is ergodic (see section 3.2.2), so as to separate statistical errors (arising from finite sampling) from systematic errors (due to force-field inaccuracies). This analysis is computationally demanding when testing several force-field variants due to the fact that a full simulation has to be performed every time a force-field term is changed. An efficient alternative comes from reweighting the already available simulations to take into account changes in the force field. In particular, a trajectory obtained using a given force field with potential energy function U0(x) can be used to compute
ensemble averages corresponding to another force field with potential energy function U1(x) by weighting each of the visited
conformations x proportionally to w(x) ∝ exp(−(U1(x) − U0(x))/kBT). This procedure is analogous to the free-energy perturbation method (see section 3.2.7) and is used to switch between two alternative force fields. Reweighting has been used, for instance, in ref 163 to predict the effect of small perturbations applied on the dihedral angles on tetranucleotides and tetraloops, and in refs 143 and 144 to test full dihedral reparameterizations on tetranucleotides. Unfortunately, this procedure, known as exponential averaging, is only effective when the fluctuations of the difference between the two potential energy functions are small. The statistical efficiency
can be quantified computing the Kish’s effective sample size,164 which is defined as (∑xw(x))2/∑x(w(x))2 and reports the
effective number of conformations with non-negligible weight. Effective sample size will be large only when the ensembles generated by the two force fields are significantly overlapping. If some structure that is stabilized by the force field U1 is never
visited by the force field U0, its effect on the ensemble averages cannot be estimated without running a new simulation using the force field U1. In addition, reweighting might be highly
inefficient when charges are perturbed, because, due its longrange nature, electrostatic energy can be heavily affected by very small changes in the charges.
3.2. Accessing Long Time Scales, Thermodynamics, and Kinetics
MD simulations allow the equations of motion to be solved and the evolution of the system to be followed in real time. This is achieved using a model empirical potential, the force field, which mimics the real interatomic forces acting on the simulated molecular system. Aside from the approximations inherent in the force field, which are discussed in sections 3.1.1 and 3.4.2, the most important limitation of MD is that the time
scales that can be simulated are limited by the available computational resources. The time scales over which the conformational transformations of RNA occur are very
heterogeneous.70 Fast processes such as the internal dynamics
of small hairpins165 occur over microseconds to milliseconds. Slower processes such as ligand-induced riboswitch fold
ing166,167 occur on scales of seconds to minutes or beyond.168 In addition, because simulations are performed on a single unique copy of a molecule, it would be necessary to observe multiple individual rare events to obtain statistically converged properties and thus realistic thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the process under investigation. Such comprehensive simulations are clearly beyond the reach of current computers.
3.2.1. Considerations about Convergence. From a theoretical point of view, MD simulations can be seen as Markov chains (see section 3.2.3), which means that the coordinates at a given time step only depend on the coordinates at the previous time step. When used to compute ensemble averages such as populations of individual substates, MD simulations will suffer, as any method based on Markov chains, from a statistical error due to the finite length of the simulation. In addition, if the simulation is not long enough, the population of the initial structure will be artificially enhanced, with an effect known as “initialization bias” in the Markov-chain Monte Carlo literature. The former effect can be decreased by making a simulation longer, and the latter by discarding the initial equilibration part (see, e.g., ref 169 for a discussion on the compromises to be taken in this sense). However, whenever an MD simulation remains stuck in a given conformation, one should try to understand whether this specific conformation corresponds to the global minimum of the free energy of the system or it is just a kinetically trapped local minimum. Rigorously speaking, the only way to answer this question is to run a simulation capable to explore the whole conformational space. In practice, one might try simulations starting from different conformations and see if results are independent of the starting point. Using state-of-the-art hardware and software, the only RNA systems for which a fully converged exploration of the conformational space can be achieved with plain molecular dynamics are probably nucleosides or dinucleotides.
However, using highly optimized hardware73 or with the enhanced sampling techniques discussed in this section, tetranucleotides or even tetraloops (see sections 4.1 and 4.2) can also be explored exhaustively. Probably, neither plain MD nor enhanced sampling methods can completely sample the conformational space of larger systems. In these cases, one might only be able to sample different conformations that are in the vicinity of the initial structure. Still, in some cases, it is possible to obtain relative populations of relevant substates that can be compared to experiments. In other words, whereas full convergence might be impossible to reach, one might be in the situation where multiple transitions between the locally available substates are seen and local exploration is virtually converged. In addition, series of smartly designed simulations initiated in different parts of the conformational space and characterizing properties of different types of conformations present on the free-energy landscape may provide unique insights complementing the available experimental data even
without simulating large-scale transitions.170

rugged.171−174 The time scale distribution of its ruggedness and metastability is continuous, without clear borders. In other words, the metastable states may persist over diverse time scales and may include different backbone conformations, diverse patterns of directly bound ions, differences in base-pair geometries, or even entirely different folds. The definition of metastability depends on the observed time scale and the capability of experiments to detect the ruggedness of the folding landscape. When reconformations are faster than the temporal resolution of the experiments, or in a bulk experiment where a macroscopic number of copies of the same molecule is present in a buffer, an experiment would probe some averaged ensemble property. MD is a fundamental method for studying the ruggedness of the RNA conformational landscape. In principle, MD simulations are not limited by experimentally detectable properties and temporal resolutions, which is important because many dynamic processes not resolvable by experiments may be critically important for the biochemical and biological functions of RNAs. As extensively discussed elsewhere, MD simulations are analogous to single-molecule experiments performed on extremely short time scales (typically a few μs at most) initiated from a specific starting structure (single
geometries).154,175,176 Therefore, the explored ensembles are usually highly dependent on the initial state (including uncertainties in the initial, usually experimentally determined,
geometries).154,175−177 Using standard simulations, it is difficult if not impossible to accurately evaluate the relative populations of all of the available metastable states on the free-energy landscape. To tackle this issue, several groups have worked over the last few decades to develop methods that allow properties that emerge over long time scales to be investigated using relatively short simulations (see, e.g., refs 178−182 and Figure 10). It is important to mention that enhanced sampling techniques would be almost wholly unnecessary if they could be replaced by straightforward MD simulations with sufficiently long time scales. Development of optimized MD soft
ware183−186 and, more recently, availability of GPUs187−190 have made it possible to simulate systems consisting of a few tens to hundreds of nucleotides for time scales on the order of a few microseconds. Even more striking has been the effort made by the D. E. Shaw group, which has developed a dedicated
machine for MD73 that allows access to the millisecond time
scale when simulating small proteins191 and DNA.115 This machine is called Anton and is based on MD-specific integrated circuits that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized high-speed communication network. Despite this remarkable progress, biologically relevant time scales are currently out of reach and will likely remain so for decades. Therefore, even Anton simulations are sometimes performed using enhanced sampling techniques to exhaustively sample the
studied system’s conformational space.192 Even in the future, MD practitioners will certainly still need enhanced sampling methods to bridge the time scale gap between simulations and experiments. A wide array of methods have been developed over the years for obtaining information about biomolecular systems that emerges over long time scales from short simulations. In general, they have been tested more extensively on proteins than nucleic acids, and fewer studies still have focused on RNA. These methods are also difficult to classify because many of
them combine elements of previous methods that were developed on the basis of diverse principles. The conceptually simplest way to obtain long time scale information is to combine multiple short trajectories (section 3.2.3, Figure 10A). Techniques of this class, such as Markov state models (MSM), mostly provide recipes for initializing the simulations in a way that maximizes the sampling of important events (e.g., crossings of free-energy barriers), and for properly combining the resulting information. MSM methods can also be exceptionally useful for analyzing MD simulation results from huge amounts of simulation data, and visualizing them in a humanly comprehensible way. Indeed, meaningfully analyzing raw MD trajectories is often insurmountably complex due to the vast amount of data they contain. Alternatively, one could use enhanced sampling methods to accelerate events. The methods of this kind that have been most widely used for exploring the conformational space of RNA molecules are based on the principle of annealing and
Figure 10. Scheme representing some of the methods discussed in this section. (A) In Markov state models, extensive simulations (usually sets of simulations) are analyzed, and the observed states are clustered. A kinetic matrix is then constructed that provides the probability of observing transitions between pairs of clusters (section 3.2.3). (B) In replica exchange simulations, numerous replicas of the system are simulated in parallel using different parameters (e.g., temperature or potential energy function). From time to time, exchanges are attempted with a Monte Carlo procedure. Sampling in the reference (unmodified) replica is enhanced by the method (section 3.2.4). (C) In metadynamics, a bias potential is added to compensate the underlying free-energy barriers along a preselected collective variable (CV). If the chosen CV is capable of discriminating the transition state, the transition probability is enhanced (section 3.2.5).

replica-exchange (section 3.2.4, Figure 10B). In this approach, a set of simulations (replicas) at different temperatures are performed in parallel, and exchanges among the replicas allow free-energy barriers to be crossed by coupling the cold replicas with the more ergodic hot ones. This idea has been extended further, allowing the temperature to be replaced as the control parameter in favor of arbitrary (suitable) modifications of the system’s potential energy (i.e., the Hamiltonian). Other approaches are based on the principle of importance sampling, where an artificially modified ensemble is explored (section 3.2.5, Figure 10C). In general, importance sampling techniques aim to derive properties of a particular ensemble (probability distribution of structures) of interest from samples generated from a different (biased) distribution. In these methods, a biasing force (or a bias potential) is used to accelerate sampling in a reduced (low-dimensional) space consisting of slow degrees of freedom or collective variables (CVs). The CVs should reflect the essence of the studied processes, resembling reaction coordinates in simple chemical reactions. These methods thus assume that the studied process can be described with sufficient realism using just a few degrees of freedom, which can be seen as a coarse graining of the full coordinate space, that is, a low-dimensional projection. The remaining dynamics that is orthogonal to the space defined by the CVs is assumed to be unimportant to the studied process. CVs can be very complex functions of the Cartesian coordinates of the system. Enhanced sampling methods aim to flatten the Boltzmann distribution in the CV space by imposing a bias that allows sampling of the whole CV space. The effect of this external potential is reweighted a posteriori (using procedures similar to that discussed in section 3.1.4) to recover the properties of the unbiased canonical ensemble. Enhanced sampling methods are based on the idea of guiding the system in some way through unrealistically fast trajectories so as to observe the desired events. This idea can be taken to its logical extreme by considering a case in which the path consists of a transformation in which the chemical identity of the simulated molecules is changed, as it is done in alchemical methods (section 3.2.7). These alchemical transitions may involve the use of chemically unrealistic intermediate states (in which, for example, atoms present in the initial system are simply removed) because the free energy is a state function and the free-energy difference between two states is pathindependent. Finally, it is possible to remove solvent degrees of freedom to accelerate sampling (section 3.2.8). Whereas this procedure introduces some unavoidable approximations that might be critical in RNA systems, it is particularly attractive as it allows free energies to be computed from single conformations, bypassing the need to simulate reactive trajectories. The following sections discuss these methods and their strengths and limitations in more detail, with a particular focus on those that have been applied to RNA systems.
3.2.3. Markov State Models. In recent years, the availability of massively parallel computing resources has increased exponentially. Modern supercomputing clusters make it possible to run hundreds of parallel simulations. However, advanced analysis techniques must be used to combine the data generated by multiple, out-of-equilibrium, short simulations, and extract relevant information from them. The framework of Markov state models (MSMs) is perfectly suited for this task. In the last decade, MSMs have been exploited to elucidate the slow kinetics of complex
biomolecules,193−199 and the theory behind them has been
increasingly refined.200−203 In brief, the workflow for constructing a MSM from a set of MD trajectories is as follows: (1) MD data are clustered into a finite set of microstates. Each microstate consists of a number of structures that can be considered sufficiently similar to be indistinguishable (equivalent) in kinetic terms. A lag-time, τ, is selected for timediscretization of the process, and transitions between the microstates that occur during the simulation are registered with a stride corresponding to the lag-time τ. (2) Information from MD (the observed transitions at the lag-time window) is used to construct a transition probability matrix, T, whose elements, Tij, represent the probability that the system, starting from microstate j, will transition to microstate i after a time τ. (Note that the T matrix is often used in its transposed form, and then the meaning of indexes i and j is interchanged.) (3) The system is modeled as a Markov chain between the aforementioned microstates, governed by the transition probability matrix, so that the probability distribution of the microstates at time t + τ depends only on the distribution of microstates at time t and not on the system’s history. In other words, its dynamics is modeled as a discrete process, in which at each time step, τ, the molecule “jumps” from one microstate (i.e., conformation) to another. (4) The spectrum of eigenvalues of the matrix T is analyzed to extract information about the system’s thermodynamics, dynamics, and kinetics. The resulting discrete MSM aims to approximate the continuous dynamics of the simulated system by a discrete process. Using a MSM, one can evolve either the individual stochastic trajectories (time series of microstates, i.e., a timediscretized counterpart of the MD trajectory) or the probability distributions (of the microstates) of the system with a discrete time step τ. The MSM approximation can be extremely accurate; that is, it can provide the same time-development picture as the MD simulations. As compared to other methods for accessing long time scales that will be discussed below, such as replica exchange or CV-based methods, a MSM can provide information on a system’s kinetic properties and transition rates between states of interest, whereas information on these properties is generally lost when the system’s dynamics is biased. The interpretation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix of an MSM is the following: the first eigenvector of the transition matrix has a unit eigenvalue and corresponds to the stationary distribution vector, that is, the equilibrium probabilities of the microstates; the other eigenvectors describe relaxation processes toward equilibrium, and the corresponding eigenvalues, λi, are related to the time scales, ti, of these processes in descending order, by the
relationship ti = −τ/ln(λi). MSM can be fruitfully applied to help extracting humaninterpretable information from a single long MD trajectory, which repeatedly and spontaneously samples the rare event under investigation. If the simulation samples the process sufficiently well, the MSM can be used to create a coarsegrained model of the process, providing the much-needed insights into the otherwise overwhelming amount of raw simulation data. Alternatively, MSMs can be used to merge together separate MD trajectories, by discretizing the ensemble spanned by all trajectories, and counting the transitions occurring in any of the trajectories. This enables one to

rigorously combine the information coming from multiple trajectories in a single quantitative model. Two main approaches for constructing a reliable MSM are (i) to employ an extremely fine discretization of the phase space into microstates, or, (ii) alternatively, to count transitions between larger basins that correspond to metastable states, in a
so-called “coring” approach.204 We will focus here on the description of the former approach, as it is most commonly used in current research. The first step in the construction of a MSM is the discretization of the phase space into microstates. This can be done employing different clustering methods as well as different
metrics.200−203 An important advance in this field is the development of time-lagged independent component analysis
(TICA).201−203,205,206In this method, linear combinations of the input variables are constructed so as to find degrees of freedom that have the largest autocorrelation times and that are thus expected to be more important in the kinetic analysis. This allows the subsequent clustering to be done in a lower dimensionality, in the space of the leading TICA components, by projecting the simulation trajectories onto the largest TICA components. TICA can be viewed as a method analogous to principal component analysis (PCA), which has been conventionally used to process MD trajectories in the past. PCA identifies linear combinations of the input degrees of freedom with the highest variance, while TICA finds those with the highest autocorrelation times, that is, corresponding to the slowest processes occurring in the simulations. TICA can be performed starting from a description based on the Cartesian coordinates of all of the solute atoms, or using a description defined on some internal coordinates, as, for instance, dihedral angles or pairwise distances between relevant atoms. As with other dimensionality reduction methods, one must always be aware that some important pieces of information might be discarded, distorting the description of fast time-scale processes. Because of the remarkable results it has achieved, TICA has been recommended as a standard tool for coordinate transformation and dimensionality reduction of MD trajectories
data.207 Discretization of the phase space into a finite number of microstates is the main source of systematic error in a MSM. This step breaks the Markovianity of the system, that is, the assumption that the transition probabilities only depend on the current state of the system. Thus, modeling the system as a Markov chain causes deviations from the true dynamics. It has
been shown200 that these deviations can be reduced in two ways: by increasing the lag-time, τ, and by using a finer discretization scheme. In practice, when dealing with real finitelength simulations, both factors affect the quality of the computation. The lag time depends intrinsically on the Markovianity of the system and the desired temporal resolution. Too short of a lag time will make the model nonMarkovian. As a rule of thumb, the interconversions among structures within each individual microstates must be fast as compared to the lag time. Typical values of τ used in MSM of
proteins and nucleic acids are in the range from 10−1 to 101 ns, and are usually selected by looking at the convergence of the implied time scales, as described below. The number of microstates should be large enough to avoid losing resolution due to coarse graining of the phase space but small enough for there to be a reasonable number of transitions between them (i.e., to have a sufficient statistical precision) and for the matrix size to be manageable. These considerations do not apply to
“coring” methods,204 which use much smaller sets of microstates that do not need to cover the system’s full conformational space. For simulations of medium-sized biomolecules with contemporary methods, one typically uses MSMs with at least
102−104 microstates.207 This number of microstates makes visualization and intuitive analyses of the model impractical. Several methods exist to overcome this problem by exploiting the kinetic information provided by an MSM to construct an even coarser representation of the system, lumping the MSM microstates into a few metastable macrostates. A commonly
used approach is Perron-cluster cluster analysis (PCCA),208 a method that exploits the sign structure of the eigenvectors of the transition matrix to define the optimal metastable partition of the MSM microstates. More advanced versions of the
method known as PCCA+209 and PCCA++210 assign each microstate a probability of being a member of a given metastable macrostate. Another possibility is to reduce the model’s complexity by constructing a hidden Markov model (HMM) of the
dynamics.211 In this approach, the system is represented as a Markov chain between hidden metastable macrostates. These macrostates are not directly observable but are measured by looking at the microstate, which at every step is extracted from a distribution probability that depends on the hidden macrostate. Thus, one assumes that an additional (hidden) variable can be used to label the states, and its time series is inferred by the time series of the observed variables. The HMM defines states without neat boundaries, and a given conformation has probabilities to be simultaneously participating in multiple macrostates. A key strength of the MSM approach is the observation that it is not necessary to assume global equilibration in the ensemble of trajectories provided that the MD is in local equilibrium within each microstate. This is what makes MSMs powerful tools for accessing long-time-scale kinetics. In fact, by choosing smart initialization points for the simulations, one can obtain an ensemble of relatively short trajectories, each of them sampling transitions relevant to different steps of a complex and slow configurational change. By combining these trajectories in a MSM, it is, in principle, possible to reconstruct even processes that occur on a time scale longer than the span of any of the individual trajectories. The largest implied time scale can be of the same order of magnitude of the aggregate duration of all
MD trajectories used to build the MSM.212 Obviously, the initialization points must be chosen with care, and one must ensure that no important regions of the phase space are ignored. There are various ways of selecting the starting points for MD simulations to be used in the construction of a MSM. If available, prior knowledge about the system can be used to initialize simulations in different positions along interesting conformational changes (for example, if experimental structures of multiple conformations are available). Alternatively, new simulations can be initialized whenever a single “exploratory” simulation reaches a new interesting conformation. If this step is repeated recursively on each new simulation, it will produce a cascade of MD trajectories, sampling increasingly larger regions of the available phase space. By changing the criteria for identifying candidate starting points for new trajectories, it is possible to drive the system along the path of the conforma
tional change of interest.213 This approach is usually referred to as “adaptive sampling”, and it can be de facto considered as a

subclass of enhanced sampling techniques. Another powerful approach is to extract the initial structures from an ensemble of configurations obtained with some different enhanced sampling technique. As with all methods designed to reduce the computational cost of MD simulations, a MSM may provide wrong results when used in a way that is inconsistent with its basic approximations and assumptions. It is therefore important to test the validity of the Markovian approximation before drawing any conclusions from a MSM. This is usually done by looking at the convergence of the implied time scales, ti, as the value of
τ increases.214 The implied time scales should be independent of τ in a Markovian system, so their convergence can be used to select an appropriate lag time (if it exists) that corresponds to a good approximation of the true dynamics. It is useful to point out that the common practice of showing the time scales in logarithmic scale may give a false impression of convergence due to the negative convexity of the logarithm function. It is important to note that the convergence of the implied time scales is a necessary but not sufficient condition for Markovianity. When convergence is reached, the slowest implied time scale should correspond to the slowest transition mode in the studied system. Its comparison with previous knowledge of the system can provide some hint on whether the full free-energy landscape has been sufficiently sampled or not. A too short implied time scale (as compared to experiment) could indicate that important parts of the free-energy landscape are entirely missing in the simulation data set, and the MSM characterizes only a local segment of the folding landscape. This could happen when simulations are too short or not initialized to cover sufficiently the relevant portions of the phase space. For example, in studies of the folding landscape, series of simulations may be initiated (seeded) from some unfolding pathway, obtained by forced unfolding or high-temperature simulation initiated from the folded state. This may work well for molecules with fast folding via a funnel mechanism. However, when the folding landscape is rugged, inherently
obeying kinetic partitioning,215−218 major parts of the landscape are likely to be unreachable by simulations initiated from a
“seeding” unfolding trajectory.170 Such trajectory can connect the ensemble pertinent to the starting folded structure with the putative unfolded ensemble, but is not sufficient to identify misfolded structures that are present elsewhere on the folding landscape. A stricter test of the validity of the Markovian approximation can be obtained by performing a so-called “Chapman−
Kolmogorov test”200 in which one examines the time evolution of the probability of the system to be in a certain metastable state, when initialized in another, and compares the model’s predictions to the observed time evolution. Note, however, that as in all of the algorithms based on statistical sampling, there is no way to infer information about conformations that were never sampled in the simulated trajectory. Thus, these tests are not a panacea. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, in case of kinetic partitioning, even sophisticated convergence tests would not reveal the lack of convergence because the freeenergy basins corresponding to the misfolded states are entirely inaccessible to the simulations. Thus, the investigators must always perform a rational overall appraisal of the studied process and not rely merely on the numbers provided by the
computational procedures.170 Another important source of uncertainty in the predictions of a MSM is the statistical error due to finite sampling. This can
generally be estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling of the transition matrix.219 It is vital to take statistical error into account because poorly sampled transitions can easily lead to uncertainties on associated implied time scales of the same order of magnitude as the time scales themselves. It is only recently that MSMs have been employed to address
the kinetics of RNA systems.220,221 The first works suggested how the millisecond-long folding process of GNRA hairpins can be, in principle, described with the use of MSM and plain MD simulations. The results of these studies with all of their limitations are discussed in section 4.2.2.3. The MSM has also been used to elucidate the kinetics of protein/nucleic acid complexes, particularly the various aspects of RNA polymerase activity. The results of these studies are discussed in section 4.7.10. MSMs were used to characterize kinetic properties of very
short RNA oligonucleotides,222 dinucleotides composed of combinations of adenine and cytidine as well as tri- and tetranucleotides composed of adenines. The coordinates used were the dihedral angles of the studied systems and the Gvectors introduced in ref 223, which take into account the formation and direction of stacking interactions. The stacking time scales predicted by χOL3 force field were in reasonably good agreement with experimental temperature-jump measure
ments.224 These results suggest that the main relaxation modes for short oligonucleotides can be described in terms of transitions between alternative folded states rather than between random coils and native structures. However, because of the known problems of the χOL3 force field, the simulations of the r(A4) sampled intercalated structures that are inconsistent with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments (see section 4.1). Thus, agreement with experiments was only obtained after manually removing the intercalated structures from the trajectory. Results for r(A)3 are summarized in Figure 11, which represents typical output of MSM analysis followed by HMM analysis and reports the obtained clusters as well as the transition rates. MSM modeling has also been used to analyze conformational substates of conformationally restricted single-stranded three-nucleotide loops of DNA
quadruplexes;76 such approaches should be readily applicable also to various single-stranded RNA segments with restrained positions of the strand termini. Another study investigated the process of pairing and fraying of a terminal base pair of an RNA duplex with methods closely
related to MSM.225 In that paper, the authors limit their analysis to the fraying of a single base of the terminal base pair, freezing the positions of the rest of the double helix considered. Interestingly, they identified a rate-determining trapped state, in which the base is stacked but the backbone assumes a nonnative conformation. MSM methodologies have developed rapidly over the past few years, and many procedures that were favored in the past have been surpassed by better alternatives. Being already successfully applied to the study of many protein systems, they are now starting to cut their space also in the world of RNA. We expect that new applications and protocols will emerge soon, and that the limits of the method’s applicability will be more rigorously discussed.

known as temperature-replica-exchange MD (T-REMD).226 T

REMD belongs to a wider class of methods based on simulated
annealing.227 The principle of simulated annealing is that a system kept at a higher temperature can more easily cross energy barriers and is thus better able to explore its conformational space than a system at low temperature. This is because the time required to cross a free-energy barrier depends exponentially on the height of the enthalpic part of the barrier divided by the temperature of the system. However, the temperature also affects the equilibrium populations of different conformations. Therefore, running MD simulations at a high temperature would yield faster conformational transitions but might also result in extensive sampling of structures whose population is negligible at lower temperatures (e.g., room temperature). High temperature simulations have sometimes been used qualitatively to enhance sampling of RNA systems (see, e.g., ref 228). However, high temperature simulations alone cannot be used to directly estimate the values of experimental observables at physiological temperatures, and this approach is considered rather obsolete these days. The idea of annealing is, after the transition, to slowly decrease the simulation temperature so as to gradually shift the system to explore a relevant region of its conformational space. The main problem of simulated annealing is that the results can heavily depend on the schedule used to reduce the temperature. In particular, final conformations might retain properties of the initial high temperature part of the simulation if the cooling is too fast. An important step forward was
introduction of the simulated tempering approach.229 In a simulated tempering simulation, the temperature is not changed on a predefined schedule but evolves under the control of a Monte Carlo (MC) procedure that allows the system to evolve at equilibrium. The goal of the method is to perform a random walk across the temperature space, leading to multiple heating and cooling cycles. Once a set of temperatures is chosen from a given range, a weight is assigned
to each temperature state that determines the probability of visiting that state (i.e., how much time the system will spend there). If the weights are not chosen properly, the random walk in the temperature space will be confined to a subspace to some degree rather than fully exploring the entire space. Schemes for automatically adjusting these weights have been pro
posed.192,230 Practical solution that avoids the assignment of weights is the T-REMD (i.e., PT) algorithm, in which multiple replicas are simulated simultaneously at different temperatures. From time to time, an exchange of coordinates between two replicas in the temperature ladder is attempted and either accepted or rejected using a MC procedure based on the potential energies of the simulated systems. Because the number of simulations at each temperature is fixed (i.e., there is one at each temperature), it is not necessary to compute weights, and the computational effort expended at each temperature is identical by construction. T-REMD was
originally introduced in studies on spin glasses231 and was subsequently used by the biomolecular research community in
conjunction with Monte Carlo methods232 and then with
MD.226 It is probably the most widely used enhanced sampling method in biomolecular simulations, and several papers have described applications of T-REMD to RNA systems; see, for example, refs 120, 129, 221, and 233−244. One important choice when setting up a T-REMD study is the temperature range spanned by the replicas. The range typically goes from the reference temperature to a temperature high enough for enthalpic barriers to be easily crossed (usually between 400 and 600 K). These high temperatures are far from the physiological conditions because they are well above the boiling point of water under simulated conditions. However, one should note that the water models used in MD simulations typically have higher boiling points than that of real water. Additionally, most T-REMD simulations are performed at constant volume and so are not subject to this issue. While this is not usually a problem, it should be accounted for properly whenever conformational changes are correlated with changes in the effective volume of the solute, as done by Garcia et
al.237,241 The highest temperature should not be seen as a physical temperature but as a computational tool for enhancing sampling. It should therefore be optimized to enable the observation of the greatest possible number of conformational changes. T-REMD is certainly a robust tool for overcoming enthalpic barriers. However, folding barriers (often) contain significant entropic contributions, and then the effect of high temperatures to enhance sampling is limited. Paradoxically, the addition of more high temperature replicas could even make the algorithm less computationally efficient because the additional cost of the extra replicas might not be fully compensated by more effective sampling and corresponding shorter folding time. Moreover, the number of states that should be explored increases significantly with temperature, so the dimensionality of the generalized ensemble (i.e., the combination of all temperature ensembles) becomes larger. This makes achieving convergence in a T-REMD simulation more difficult. For these reasons, evaluations of the computational efficiency of a T-REMD procedure could yield very different answers depending on the
specific system investigated.245 The goal of replica exchange methods is to maximize the number of statistically independent visits at low temperatures. To do this, it is important to maximize the number of successful exchanges and reduce the time a replica needs to visit a high

temperature and return. Put another way, one must minimize the time the replica needs to traverse the temperature ladder. The efficiency of parallel tempering simulations is thus often measured by the round-trip time τrt. This time depends on the average exchange acceptance across the replicas, the number of replicas, and the stride of the replica exchange attempt. If subsequent exchanges are not correlated, one would expect τrt to be proportional to the stride between consecutive exchange
attempts, which should thus be as small as possible.246,247 The benefit of reducing the stride between consecutive attempts is moderated by the fact that they are correlated, so it is rarely useful to choose a stride that is significantly shorter than the autocorrelation time of the acceptance itself. In practice, the exchange stride in explicit-solvent T-REMD is typically set to a fraction of a picosecond. Recent algorithms have achieved performance improvements by using a procedure that mimics the limit of exchanging at every MD step (the so-called infinite
swapping limit).248 When setting up a T-REMD simulation, it is also important to properly fix the temperature distribution so that the potential energy distributions of neighboring replicas overlap. This is often done so as to obtain a high and, possibly, uniform acceptance across the replica ladder. Analytical derivations in simple systems have shown that for a uniform acceptance ratio, the difference between adjacent temperatures should be chosen inversely proportional to the square root of the systems heat
capacity and should increase with the temperature.249 Because the heat capacity is proportional to the number of particles, the number of replicas required to span a given temperature range should grow in proportion to the square root of the number of atoms. This makes T-REMD very computationally demanding in large systems such as explicitly solvated biomolecules. It must be also noted that the assumption that specific heat is temperature independent, which leads to a geometric progression of temperatures, is not always realistic. This approximation is less appropriate for systems simulated in an implicit solvent (see section 3.2.8), whose heat capacity is not dominated by the solvent. Many approaches have been developed to optimize the distribution of replicas to maintain a uniform acceptance, to reduce round-trip times, or to adjust the replicas to specific heat capacity (see, e.g., refs 250−252). After a T-REMD simulation has been performed, unbiased populations of different substates can be obtained from the reference low-temperature replica. The key point is that fully converged T-REMD should provide information on the system’s equilibrium thermodynamics (as defined by the force field) at each temperature in the temperature ladder, although the system’s kinetics will be obscured by the discontinuity caused by the swaps. Interestingly, there have been some attempts to reconstruct kinetics from T-REMD simulations by making some a priori assumptions on the dependence of the transition rates on the temperature, including one on an RNA
system simulated using a native-centric potential.253 It is also possible to combine information from multiple replicas by performing a weighted-histogram analysis (WHAM, see section
3.2.5).254,255
Analysis of errors in T-REMD simulations is not trivial.
While a standard blocking analysis256 could be used to analyze the populations in the reference replica of a T-REMD simulation, the resulting errors might be significantly underestimated because of the correlations hidden in the replica swaps. In an extreme case, one might encounter a large number of apparent transitions that are only a signature of the swaps
and do not correspond to a true exploration of the
conformational space.257 This issue can be tackled by reconstructing continuous trajectories that follow the system across the swaps, that is, as it travels across the temperature ladder (also known as “demultiplexed” trajectories). Several works (see, e.g., refs 129, 242, 258, and 259) have examined such demultiplexed trajectories and used differences in the populations of the relevant substates in these trajectories to qualitatively identify convergence problems (Figure 12). Demultiplexed trajectories can also be used in more rigorous
error estimations based on an autocorrelation function.255
A common practical problem with all replica exchange methods is that the minimum number of replicas required to achieve reasonable acceptance might be impractically large. A possible solution is to use the simulated tempering scheme discussed above, where a single simulation is performed and the temperature is changed over time. Alternatively, one could use
the well-tempered ensemble (WT) scheme260 in which a bias is imposed on the system’s potential energy to partially flatten its probability distribution histogram (and thus also the corresponding free-energy surface). In the WT ensemble, the
partition function can be expressed as Zγ = ∫ [e−βUN(U)]1/γ dU, where U is the potential energy, N(U) is the temperatureindependent density of microstates expressed as a function of U, β = 1/kBT, and γ is a biasing factor (for the unbiased distribution, the partition function is standardly Z =
∫ [e−βUN(U)] dU). This approach could thus be interpreted as a CV-based method like those discussed in section 3.2.5, in which the potential energy is considered as the biased CV along which the probability distribution is flattened (scaled down). WT ensemble increases the mean square fluctuations of U by a factor of γ while keeping the averages of U essentially unchanged as compared to the unbiased canonical ensemble. The WT ensemble approach thus can be directly combined

Twenty-four histograms from a TREMD simulation after 200 ns (black) and 2010 ns (red) per replica are shown. Each histogram contains data from one “demultiplexed” trajectory (see the text), which is a continuous trajectory traveling through the temperature ladder. In the first part of the simulation (black data), it is evident that different trajectories sample different parts of the space, suggesting the simulation not to be converged. At the end of the simulation (the red data), all of the substates are almost equivalently sampled by all of the replicas. Reprinted with permission from ref 258.

with T-REMD in a hybrid approach where multiple replicas are still employed but the number of replicas is significantly reduced, thanks to the increased fluctuations of the potential energy. Alternatively, one could increase the acceptance rate by using short nonequilibrium simulations provided that the
acceptance rate is properly computed.261 It must be stressed that these approaches allow the number of simulated replicas to be decreased but do not necessarily decrease the round trip time, which is the time required for a demultiplexed replica to travel from the lowest temperature to the highest and back. Therefore, there is no theoretical guarantee that these methods will accelerate sampling, although they have done so in
empirical cases examined to date.262 A full discussion of these methods is beyond the scope of this Review. The replica exchange protocol can be generalized to methods where ergodicity is not obtained by increasing temperature but by scaling portions of the force field or adding penalty potentials disfavoring specific structures (e.g., by biasing/ flattening potentials along selected dihedral angles). These methods are generally known as Hamiltonian replica exchange (H-REMD) methods because the different replicas use different
Hamiltonian functions.263 Again, an unbiased replica (with the unperturbed original Hamiltonian) is used to gather data to be compared to experiments, like the reference temperature replica in T-REMD. Another way to significantly decrease the number of replicas in a REMD simulation is to use replica exchange
with solute tempering (REST),264,265 a specific variant of HREMD. Here, instead of changing the temperature, one scales down portions of the potential energy of the system. Typically, it is only the solute’s potential energy that is scaled. REST has been applied to the full folding of an RNA tetraloop and
provided results compatible with T-REMD.129 Notably, it is
possible to only apply the scaling to a portion of the solute,266 which significantly reduces the size of the conformational space to be explored. This variant of REST has been used to accelerate the dynamics of an RNA tetraloop without affecting those of the corresponding stem, allowing different conformations of the capping nucleotides to be captured in a very
short time.267 Other variants of H-REMD are possible. For instance, REMD has been used in combination with accelerated MD
(aMD)268 to sample structures in RNA tetranucleotides.269 In the aMD method, the dihedral potentials are modified to avoid the system spending too much time in the minima, at the expense of not sampling the Boltzmann distribution. By constructing a ladder of such replicas that are increasingly biased, one can exploit the REMD strategy to obtain an unbiased ensemble in the reference replica. It is worth mentioning that alternative procedures to reconstruct unbiased distributions from aMD simulations have been proposed that do not require the use of replicas but instead make some
assumption on the distribution of the potential energy.270 HREMD approaches in which the replicas have different scaled dihedral energies have been used to simulate RNA tetranucleo
tides.259,271 This approach has been also combined with TREMD in a multidimensional replica exchange method, that is, M-REMD. In the case of tetranucleotides, this replica exchange framework proved more efficient than using the Hamiltonian or
the temperature separately,271 although it required a very large number (192) of replicas. It should be noted that, although using large numbers of replicas is sometime helpful in exploiting large computing clusters, it makes it more difficult to assess the simulation’s convergence. Indeed, it reduces the
likelihood that “demultiplexed” replicas (see above) will be able to sample the whole range of temperatures and Hamiltonians. Finally, the binding and unbinding of ions to nucleic acids can be accelerated by scaling down the ions’ electrostatic and Lennard-Jones parameters in the higher replicas of the
ladder.272 The idea of using a replica ladder is also employed
in other REMD methods that are discussed below.259,273 The idea of accelerating a portion of the system (e.g., a particular tetraloop) without affecting the dynamics of another part (e.g., a stem) is very powerful and has been applied to RNA in various ways. For instance, in ref 233, the capping nucleotides of an RNA stem-loop were accelerated by coupling each region to a different thermostat. Historically, the idea of accelerating only a portion of the system was first proposed as an enhanced sampling method per se. In the locally enhanced sampling (LES) technique, multiple copies of a system are
simulated.274 Some of the atoms are kept in common between all of the copies, while atoms in regions selected for enhancement are replicated. The replicated atoms are subjected to a force that is scaled down by a factor corresponding to the number of copies. There is a clear parallel between the copies in a LES simulation and the biased replicas in the solute tempering approach: the number of LES copies is equivalent to the inverse of the potential-energy scaling factor in REST. The LES method has been used by several groups to enhance sampling in RNA systems, for example, in refs 233 and 274−277. A strong point of the LES approach is that the use of multiple copies enables an intrinsically parallel (and thus fast) exploration of the conformational space for the region of interest. However, when used in explicit solvent, all solvent molecules are typically shared among the copies and effectively keep the copies highly correlated. Therefore, it has been suggested that LES is best used with implicit solvent
simulations (see section 3.2.8).275 LES does not allow the unbiased populations to be recovered. Thus, while it significantly improves the speed of conformational sampling, it cannot be used to estimate populations that can be directly compared to experiments. This is probably the main reason why LES has not been used in recent works.
3.2.5. Methods Based on Importance Sampling. Another class of enhanced sampling methods is based on
umbrella sampling (US).278 The main idea of US is that one chooses a priori a set of collective variables (CVs) that describe and distinguish the metastable states of the system and the corresponding transition states. In its original formulation, US works by adding a bias potential that is a function of the selected CVs and that can bring the system as an umbrella through the transition state. Like a catalyst, this bias potential should ideally decrease the energy of the transition state to increase the transition rate. In contrast to the above-mentioned annealing methods, the important sampling techniques are generally able to address entropically driven processes such as folding events by using properly chosen CVs. In addition, they allow high free-energy barriers on a priori known CVs to be crossed in a short time. On the other hand, the sampling is enhanced only in these few selected CVs, so that the probability of overcoming barriers is increased only in these few dimensions, while all perpendicular degrees of freedom are sampled as (in)efficiently as in the plain unbiased simulations. The entropically rich unfolded state that typically occupies a large part of the multidimensional configuration space will be thus sampled less efficiently than the conformationally well-defined folded state.

Another main obstacle of this approach is that it is usually difficult to know a priori the position of the transition state in the CV space and its stability. For this reason, US is almost invariably used by performing multiple simulations where the CV is restrained to explore the vicinity of a series of given values along the CV joining the initial and final states, or by defining a path along which the free-energy profile is calculated. Note that, in practice, the US simulations are usually seeded using some form of a short pulling simulation, which generates series of starting configurations for the individual US windows between the initial and final states. The effect of this procedure can be nontrivial as discussed later in this section. The US simulations are finally merged using the weighted histogram
method (WHAM).254 As a result, one can obtain a free-energy profile (landscape) as a function of the biased CVs, which is also known as the potential of mean force (PMF). The name PMF derives from the fact that its negative gradient determines the mean force acting on the system in the given point of the CV space. The words PMF and free-energy profile are largely interchangeable when discussing the dependence of the free energy on a CV. The relative probability of finding the system in any two points i and j of the CV space can be calculated as
pi/pj = e−Δw/kT, where pi and pj are the probabilities, and Δw =
wi − wj is the difference between the corresponding PMF
values. This equation relates the populations of different structures with the free-energy landscapes. Note that the relative free energies of two (sub)states from the free-energy landscapes can be obtained by integrating the corresponding populations over the respective parts of the landscape that correspond to the (sub)states. Alternatively, WHAM can be formulated to provide the full unbiased distribution, allowing one to compute populations of specific states even though these states are not identified by the
biased CVs alone.279 In practice, this allows one to choose biased CVs on the basis of a priori information and then analyze the resulting trajectory by projecting it onto different CVs selected a posteriori. US with multiple restraints is probably the method of this class that has been most widely applied to RNA systems (see, e.g., refs 98, 141, 159, and 280−285), usually employing one or two CVs. For instance, the unfolding of a small hairpin has
been studied by biasing its end-to-end distance.98,159 The usual requirement of US calculations is that the histograms (i.e., probability distributions) of the CVs in neighboring simulations (the adjacent windows) sufficiently overlap. Overlaps are required for the self-consistent procedure used by WHAM method to converge to a unique solution. This limitation might be to some extent lifted by using an umbrella integration
method.286 As with all other methods based on importance sampling, the accuracy of US depends on the convergence with respect to the simulated time. Evaluating this convergence is not trivial. Statistical errors on the reported free-energy landscapes (or in the corresponding populations) are sometimes computed by bootstrapping, which could significantly underestimate the error due to sample correlation. A more robust approach is to
use blocking analysis256 or, equivalently, to use block
bootstrapping,287 or at least to compare two independent US simulation sets. Care is also necessary when using this approach: an often underestimated problem of US simulations is that because each simulation is restrained to a small portion of the conformational space, transitions between metastable states are not expected to occur by design. This assumption
makes it impossible to determine whether neighboring simulations overlap in the full conformational space rather than only in the CV space; overlap is very difficult to test without observing transitions, and its absence can lead to severe
error underestimation.288,289 A study on a kissing-loop complex provides a paradigmatic example of this method’s application to an RNA system (Figure
13).283 In this work, the PMF associated with complex
formation was evaluated by performing a series of common multiple restraint simulations in which the distance between the two loops was used as a biased CV. The error was estimated using a standard blocking analysis that in principle accounted for the time correlation between samples. At first sight, the calculations appeared to be adequately converged, as is commonly claimed in the literature describing such computations. However, two independent US simulations initialized in two different ways yielded completely different PMF profiles, both of which were incompatible with the statistical error calculated for the other simulation, indicating a drastic but hidden lack of convergence. The difference between the two simulations stemmed from the use of different initial structures: one was performed with an initial structure where the loops

Results for Holo (with ligand) and Apo (without ligand) forms are shown as obtained from two independent US simulations using different protocols to obtain the initial structures (forward, Fwd, where the loops are initially in contact; and backward, Bwd, where the loops are initially separated). Fwd and Bwd profiles are aligned at the maximum distance. The result is strongly dependent on the initialization procedure, indicating that it cannot be quantitatively trusted, even though errors computed with standard block analysis (shown as error bars) would suggest so. Still, the higher stability of the loops in the Holo form when compared to the Apo form is qualitatively captured by the simulations, though the range of calculated values is ∼30 kcal/mol.

were docked and the other with a structure in which they were not. The selected CV was not sufficient to sample transitions between docked and undocked state likely due to the presence of other kinetically relevant CVs, so-called hidden variables, that were not biased. The calculated free energy thus depended strongly on the chosen computational protocol. In other words, the study’s objective proved to be outside the applicability range of the chosen US protocol using the selected CVs. Note that many published papers do not provide such error analyses, and in many cases their authors are even unaware of the danger of a hidden lack of convergence. Common statistical methods
to analyze convergence are usually not sufficient to identify such problems. A much more robust approach to US is to include it in an REMD scheme where swaps in the conformations of neighboring replicas are periodically attempted and either accepted or rejected on the basis of an MC scheme.290 The acceptance calculation should reflect the fact that different replicas feel different bias potentials, as in the H-REMD methods discussed above. Example application of replica exchange US to the conformational sampling of an uracil ribonucleoside has been reported in ref 291 (Figure 14). The advantage of this formulation is that demultiplexed trajectories

can be constructed (see section 3.2.4) and inspected to see if transitions between relevant metastable states are observed. In contrast to classical US, which might lead to large differences between PMFs for association and dissociations pathways as highlighted in the preceding paragraph (see, e.g., Figure 13), the combination of US with REMD scheme typically provides significantly improved convergence as demonstrated, for
example, for minor-groove binding of a ligand to DNA.292 It is important to note that combining simulations with WHAM to obtain a free-energy profile essentially prevents access to any information about the system’s dynamics. Alternative approaches to WHAM that retain the dynamics information have been proposed (see, e.g., the TRAM method in section 3.2.6). The advantage of these approaches is that they are less sensitive to the initial structures. If one considers a limiting case in which the restraints used in US are infinitely strong (i.e., the value of the CVs is fixed or constrained instead of restrained), multiple restraints US becomes equivalent to a thermodynamic integration (TI)
calculation (see section 3.2.7).286 TI applied to CVs has been used to investigate nucleic acid systems in multiple
studies.240,294 A very similar principle is used in steered
MD,295 where the restraint is slowly moved so as to steer a system across the transition state. This allows one to explicitly account for the nonequilibrium work using the Jarzynski
equality.180,296 With this approach, many trajectories are simulated following the same steering protocol, and those for which less work is performed (i.e., those in which the system achieves the transitions more easily, with less force) are
weighted more.180 The Jarzynski equality allows one to obtain an exact free-energy difference even though the transition happened out of equilibrium, that is, via series of nonequilibrium simulations. Steered MD has been combined with WHAM analysis to compute the free-energy change associated
with base pair fraying.297 The strength of direct stacking interactions between a ligand and a canonical stem in a
riboswitch has also been estimated using this approach.298 The principle of steered MD and TI can be applied to any CV. When applied to root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from a
native (target) structure, it is known as targeted MD.299 This method has been used to study dimerization of stem loop SL1
from the HIV-1 genomic RNA.300 However, it is usually very difficult to recover quantitative free-energy differences from targeted MD simulations, especially when large conformational rearrangements are involved, because the change in the number of available states when steering the system to a low-RMSD ensemble produces an entropic contribution that largely dominates the free-energy change. A common problem of all of the unidirectional approaches is that there is an intrinsic bias in the final result. More precisely, whenever the transition from state A to state B is enforced, the measured free-energy change ΔG = GB − GA is systematically overestimated. Whereas this might not be a problem when qualitative results are desired (e.g., when ranking PMFs obtained under different conditions as in ref 297), it is certainly a problem when results are interpreted quantitatively. This is also true when Jarzynski-based methods are employed with a finite number of simulations, although the bias decreases as the
number of simulations increases.301 A practical solution to this problem is to combine simulations going from A to B with simulations going from B to A so as to exploit some error cancellation. In the simplest formulation of this approach, forward and backward calculations might be compared. The
result might be trusted only if it is independent of the steering direction. There is a clear analogy between this idea and the validation of US simulations shown in the Figure 13. It is also possible to rigorously combine forward and backward
calculations using a maximum likelihood approach.302 This approach was used to compute the binding affinity of the TAR
RNA to a cyclic peptide.303 CV chosen to describe the binding process in this work was the strength of the electrostatic interaction between the RNA and the peptide, which was evaluated using a Debye−Hückel model. This illustrates the richness of the possibilities that one can consider when choosing CVs. Another notable idea derived from the original US method is that of constructing a potential adaptively during the simulation. It is important to note that this is not usually done by restraining the simulation to a given region in the CV space as is common in multiple-restraint US. Rather, the approach adheres to the original concept of US in that it involves constructing a potential that stabilizes the transition state and accelerates the system’s conformational dynamics.
Several methods of this type have been proposed.304−310 One of the most popular adaptively biased methods is metadynamics, where a history-dependent procedure is used to
disfavor already visited states.307 Penalty potential is constructed step-by-step as a sum of Gaussians, in a way that is designed to flatten the distribution of the sampled points in the low-dimensional space of the CV coordinates such that, ideally, each value of the CV is equally likely to be realized. In other words, the free-energy landscape (and thus also the probability histograms of the biased simulation) is flattened in the CV space. Unbiased free-energy surface (as defined in the lowdimensional CV space) can then be estimated by inverting the bias potential. In a more recent well-tempered variant of this
approach (WT-metadynamics),308 the penalty potential grows more slowly as the simulation progresses, eventually reaching a quasi-equilibrium state. This is achieved by a bias growth control factor γ. As γ → infinity, the method becomes equivalent to the original metadynamics approach, while for γ = 1 the method corresponds to the unbiased ensemble. WTmetadynamics reduces fluctuations in estimation of the freeenergy differences between the metastable states of the system. Moreover, in WT-metadynamics, one can easily tune the parameters of the simulation to obtain a controllable partial flattening of the free-energy landscape, avoiding the exploration of unnecessary high-energy states. This is because WTmetadynamics yields the relationship V = −(1 − 1/γ)F between the constructed bias potential V and the target unbiased free-energy landscape F (both defined as lowdimensional functions of the CVs). Another important parameter controlling flattening of the free-energy landscape is the shape of the Gaussian functions used as a bias. Nonetheless, a method for setting their width automatically
was also developed.311 Excellent reviews of both flavors of
metadynamics are available.182,312 WT-metadynamics has been used to study RNA tetraloops
(TLs).129,313 However, full convergence was not achieved in these simulations likely due to a too complex nature of the TLs conformational dynamics that was excessively oversimplified by the selected CVs. Nevertheless, even simulations that did not achieve statistical convergence have provided useful insights into the studied systems. For instance, WT-metadynamics results complemented those obtained with other methods indicating that the native structure of a TL was not correctly

predicted by the tested force fields (see sections 4.2.2.3, 4.2.2.4,
and 3.1.2.5).129 The main advantage of methods based on construction of an adaptive bias potential when compared to multiple restraint US is that they only converge when explicit conformational transitions are observed, and so their reliability is significantly easier to assess. In other words, when multiple recrossing events are reported in metadynamics simulations, the result is statistically trustable. Simple tests can be performed to verify
whether important CVs are missing.314,315 A method was also proposed that allows improved CVs to be chosen after a metadynamics simulation has been performed, based on the
rule that better CVs should find higher free-energy barriers.316 In principle, this method enables the use of iterative optimization procedures. Note that a basic hysteresis in metadynamics typically leads to some overestimation of the barriers. However, use of entirely inappropriate CVs that create an overlap of different metastable states in the low-dimensional CV projection typically causes barriers to be severely underestimated. In this case, finding more appropriate CVs that lift the overlap of the metastable states reveals the true freeenergy barriers; the barriers in the mentioned work were
estimated using a reweighting procedure (see section 3.1.4).317 Easy-to-detect unstable behavior of metadynamics when the chosen CVs are not sufficient is perhaps one reason why the community using this method has developed a large number of
CVs. PLUMED318,319 and colvars320 are software plugins that implement a very large number of possible CVs and can be used both with metadynamics and with other CV-based enhanced sampling methods. Having a large database of implemented CVs is very useful, as finding the right CVs is essential for all CV-based enhanced sampling methods. Additionally, algorithms have been proposed to take advantage of multiple simulations that can be run in parallel on large
computer clusters, such as multiple-walkers321 and altruistic322 metadynamics. Multiple-walkers metadynamics allowed freeenergy profiles associated with phosphodiester backbone cleavage in small RNA motifs to be computed with high statistical accuracy using QM/MM molecular dynamics with
semiempirical potentials (see also section 4.8.2).323 Interestingly, although metadynamics was originally conceived as a method for flattening (either completely or, in the WT version, partially) the histogram of a selected CV, it has been extended to allow sampling of arbitrary preassigned probability
distributions in the CV space.324,325 In particular, it has been used to enforce dihedral angle distributions on dinucleotide systems corresponding to the populations observed in
structural databases.143 The key complicating factor of all CV-based methods stems from the difficulty of choosing appropriate CVs. Even more importantly, their applicability is critically dependent on the properties of the studied process, that is, the extent to which it can be acceptably described using a low-dimensional set of suitable CVs. On the one hand, processes that can be properly (i.e., without a loss of information) described by reaction coordinates with well-defined transition states and intermediates are ideally suited for CV-based descriptions. On the other hand, complex folding landscapes possessing a kinetic
partitioning215−218 (multiple competing metastable states, i.e., free energy basins) might be not reducible to CV-based descriptions (see also the cautionary comment in section
3.2.3).170 To be effective in accelerating sampling, CVs should have two properties. First, they should be able to distinguish
between relevant metastable states. If they lack this property, any bias potential applied to these CVs would affect the nondistinguished metastable states by an equal amount of bias as compared to the unbiased simulation. Indeed, such states would effectively merge (overlap) in the reduced (lowdimensional) space of the CVs despite being well separated in the full space of the Cartesian atomic coordinates. Thus, if these states have significantly different unbiased stabilities, some of them (the less stable ones) might be completely masked by other states in the CV-based simulation and thus not observed. Additionally, the CVs should properly describe the transition state to allow for its stabilization (i.e., to increase its accessibility) and the acceleration of the relevant transitions (Figure 15). This is usually even more difficult to achieve. In other words, the construction of CVs is the most fundamental issue when using any CV-based method, irrespective of the specifics of its implementation. One should therefore try to assess the sufficiency (completeness) of the chosen set of CVs for the intended computation before conducting simulations. Common sense can often indicate whether a system or phenomenon of interest is likely to be outside the method’s limits of applicability. The easiest way to conduct such an assessment is by checking whether a CV is truly capable of describing and distinguishing between the relevant stable or metastable conformations, for instance, by performing short unbiased simulations starting from those metastable conformations that are already known and projecting them on the putative CVs. Note that, especially in the biomolecular world, some processes and free-energy landscapes may be too complex to be reducible to a few collective degrees of freedom, no matter how smartly constructed. In such cases, a meaningful coarse graining of the dynamics to a few CVs might be fundamentally unachievable. This issue has been extensively discussed in the context of an intricate problem involving folding of guanine quadruplex DNA molecules that provides
clear examples of processes not reducible to a few CVs.170,326 In addition, even CVs that appear chemically intuitive might be finally found as inappropriate for correct description of the studied process. A textbook example is proton transfer reaction
in protonated water trimer.327 A simple empirical consistency check can be performed by looking at the reported free-energy landscapes. In a CV-based
method, the maximum boost is on the order of exp(ΔG⧧/kBT),
where ΔG⧧ is the barrier reported in the free-energy landscape. If this boost is not larger than the ratio between the real (experimental) time scale and the simulated time scale, it is unlikely that the correct event has been simulated, unless the transition time predicted by the force field is also much faster than the experimental one, due to (in this particular case potentially fortunate) force-field errors. Most commonly used CVs are based on geometric parameters such as distances, angles, or dihedral angles (Figures 13 and 14). The dihedral angles of chemically bonded atoms are often used because they make it possible to directly monitor isomerization processes. Distances are often used to describe binding events. When considering the formation of hydrogen bonds, one could use either distances or combinations of distances and angles. However, CVs can be arbitrary functions of the Cartesian coordinates of all of the atoms of the system, although typically they depend only on a fraction of them. At every time step, the CVs are computed from the atomic coordinates and used to compute the bias potential, which predicts how much every conformation in the CV space should

be penalized. Knowing the derivative of the bias potential with respect to the CVs and the derivatives of the CVs with respect to the atomic coordinates, one can compute the extra force that should be applied on the system during the simulation. Some CVs can be very intricate functions of the atomic coordinates,
such as the number of native H-bonds.313 Even electrostatic
interaction energy,303 full potential energy,260 or conforma
tional entropy328 can be chosen as CVs. Interestingly, TICA projections (see section 3.2.3) were also proposed as CVs for
metadynamics simulations.329 Notice that all of the conformations having the same values of CVs merge in CV space, and thus are biased by an identical bias potential. Thus, when
the number of native H-bonds is used as a CV, all geometries with the same number of these H-bonds are biased by the same amount, irrespective of which native H-bonds are present and which are absent. This dimensionality reduction obviously
brings a loss of information.170 From a practical point of view, CVs should be computed on the fly on every step of the MD simulations, so a CV that is particularly expensive to compute might slow the simulation. However, this problem can be
alleviated using a multiple time step framework.330 Structural deviation from a starting conformation chosen a priori might also be used as a CV. However, despite its
popularity, standard RMSD after alignment331 is a very poor CV or parameter for monitoring MD simulations (see section 4.2.2.3). RMSD between torsion angles usually provides a better discrimination of alternative structures, but its ability to describe the formation of contacts related to atoms that are far from each other in the molecular topology is low. As an extreme example, the torsional angles in a RNA duplex and in two separated A-form single stranded RNA molecules are identical, so torsional-RMSD would be unable to distinguish between these two structures. A promising RNA-specific
variable is εRMSD,223 which provides a three-dimensional contact map of base−base interactions. Given the importance
of base−base interaction patterns in RNA (section 2.2),40 this structural deviation is capable of summarizing in a single, continuous function of the coordinates the relevant disparities between two structures. εRMSD has a high correlation with
interaction network fidelity,332 which is often used to compare RNA structures, but has the advantage of being a continuous function of the atomic coordinates. It is thus usable as an RNAspecific CV for enhanced sampling methods. Structural deviations from multiple intermediates along a
pathway can be combined to create path-associated CVs.333 In such cases, one defines a path between two states in analogy to a reaction coordinate, and the two associated CVs take into account the degree of progression along this path and orthogonal deviations from the path. Another possible route is to combine structural deviations with respect to known templates so as to measure the amount of structure present in a molecule. This idea was proposed for studying the folding of β
sheets in proteins334 and has not yet been applied to RNA. It must also be noted that sometimes water plays a very important role and should be included in the CVs used to describe a reaction. Perhaps the simplest example is the association of an anion and a cation in water: because desolvation of the ions is an important intermediate step leading to association, good CVs for describing NaCl dissociation could be, for instance, the distance between the two ions as well as the number of water molecules coordinated to each ion. In one study, the electric field generated by neighboring water molecules on the two ions
was used in a similar manner.307 This effect is even more marked when interaction with water is stronger, such as in the case of divalent cations. In another work, the biased CV chosen by the authors was the number of waters coordinated to an
Mg2+ ion.335 This significantly reduced the water exchange time in the simulation, enabling fast RNA-ion binding and unbinding events to be observed. Note that CV-based methods can also be used to compute affinities between two molecules, such as binding of a ligand to RNA. As discussed above, one should bias CVs that are capable to properly distinguish the bound and unbound states, as well as the transition state. In addition, when ligand binding is calculated, one needs to take into consideration that this is an

Lower and higher free-energy levels are colored in blue and red, respectively. Middle panels: Free-energy profiles analytically projected on the collective variable CV1. Lower panels: Probability distributions as a function of CV1. Notice that states A and B correspond to the same value of CV1 and are thus seen as a single minimum in the onedimensional CV1 projection. Left panels: In this case, the free-energy barrier separating states A and B is only a few kBT high, and transitions from A to B and vice versa happen spontaneously due to thermal fluctuations, without any need to enhance sampling. As a consequence, an enhanced sampling method biasing only CV1 is expected to properly capture the transitions between all three states. Right panels: In this case, the free-energy barrier separating states A and B is large, and CV2 is an important slow degree of freedom. Thus, enhanced sampling simulation biasing only CV1 would not be able to enhance transitions from state A to state B or C. If the system reaches A, it will be trapped there for a long time. If the simulation starts at B or C, biasing the CV1 will facilitate transitions between these states while state A will remain invisible.

association/dissociation process, which is concentrationdependent. To properly compute affinities at the standard concentration, one should take into account any applied constraints and the relation between the CV space and the corresponding volume in the space of the Cartesian coordinates. For example, when simulating unbinding of a ligand, the distance r between the ligand and the binding site can be taken as a CV. However, the available volume for the movement of the ligand in the solvent in the Cartesian coordinate space increases proportionally to r2, because it corresponds to a surface area of a sphere with radius r. The larger amount of space that should be explored at larger values of r might slow the sampling. This problem can be circumvented, for example, by applying a cylindrical restraint/ constraint fixing the direction in which the ligand is transferred into the solvent. This can be done because the free energy (PMF) of the ligand that is already sufficiently far from the binding site in the bulk solvent is independent of its position (uniform); thus, it is not necessary to sample the whole bulk. However, the free energy associated with such constraints then needs to be included in the calculation. In other words, correct execution of binding free-energy calculations is not easy and requires one to respect certain basic methodological rules; further details are beyond the scope of this Review and can be
found in the literature.336−339
3.2.6. Combinations of Enhanced Sampling Methods. Most of the methods used to access long time scales in biomolecular simulations can be assigned to one of the three categories reviewed above. However, there are also important ways of combining ideas from methods belonging to different classes.
Metadynamics can be combined with T-REMD.340 Here, the main role of T-REMD is to accelerate the exploration of all of the system’s degrees of freedom, while metadynamics is used to change the balance between different regions in the CV space. This might be useful to stabilize transition states so as to accelerate some a priori known transitions. In addition, the combination can also be exploited to stabilize structures that are only metastable but for which one would like to compute the thermodynamic stabilities. Ideally, this is applied for unfolded or incorrectly folded structures. However, due to the poor quality of current force fields (see section 3.1), this idea can also be used to induce formation of the (otherwise metastable) native structure in a biased simulation. If the force field predicts a spurious structure to be the global minimum, the native structure may have a very low population in unbiased simulations. However, flattening of the free-energy landscape using an appropriate set of CVs may enable sampling of the native structure in biased simulations. This idea has been exploited to quantify the change in the thermodynamic stability of the native structure of RNA TLs in response to
modifications in the force field (section 4.2.2.3).163 This was
the first work in which the εRMSD223 variable was used as a biased CV (Figure 16). An identical protocol was later used by
another group to test force-field modifications152 (see also section 3.1.2.4) and to investigate the folding of a DNA
quadruplex.341
Another idea is bias-exchange (BE) metadynamics,342 where different replicas are used in metadynamics simulations acting on different CVs, and coordinates are swapped periodically using a standard H-REMD procedure. Thus, several replicas are simulated, each with an independent metadynamics simulation using a different CV. The difference from conventional
metadynamics is that conventional metadynamics combines several CVs to construct a true multidimensional description of the system in the space of the used CVs. However, the computational requirements of such description increase sharply with the number of CVs, so typically only two or three CVs are used. In BE metadynamics, the individual simulations with different CVs run independently, and coordinate swaps are proposed with a procedure analogous to the H-REMD approaches discussed in section 3.2.4. This allows one to use more CVs. However, the coupling (interdependence) between CVs is not explicitly taken into consideration, and the penalty potentials act on one CV at a time. Nevertheless, if such one-dimensional penalty potentials are sufficient to induce an exhaustive exploration of the conformational space, the free-energy landscape can be reconstructed, usually as a function of a few of the biased CVs. The parallel bias method allows similar results to be obtained without the
need to use multiple replicas.343 Simulations using BE metadynamics can be analyzed by using WHAM so as to
Figure 16. Free-energy landscape of a GAGA tetraloop using the χOL3
force field. The landscape was computed using WT-metadynamics on the εRMSD from the native structure coupled with T-REMD, but is here reported as a function of a posteriori chosen variables, εRMSD (upper panel), end-to-end distance (right panel), and both variables (central panel). Free energies and isoline labels are reported in kBT units. In the lower panel, typical folded, extended, and misfolded structures are presented. WT-metadynamics allowed one to sample the native structure despite that it is not the most stable structure according to the force field (see section 4.2). It is also instructive to notice that native and misfolded structures have a very similar end-toend distance. Any enhanced sampling method applied on the end-toend distance alone would not be capable of distinguishing native and misfolded structures and would thus likely lead to results highly dependent on the initial structure.

combine results from different replicas.344 This approach permits significant flexibility in the setup of the individual replicas. In practice, any change to the Hamiltonian that is believed to improve the quality of sampling can be included and discounted a posteriori. For instance, a variant of BE was used to compute the relative stability of different Mg2+ binding sites
on RNA molecules (Figures 17 and 18).335 Here, in each
replica, the binding of an Mg2+ ion at a different putative binding site was enhanced by performing metadynamics simulations using the distance between the ion and the corresponding binding site as well as the coordination number of the ion with water as the chosen CVs. At the same time, binding to competitive sites was hindered by artificial restraints. These restraints prevented ions in individual replicas from becoming stuck in binding sites that were pertinent to different replicas and were automatically taken into account during the following WHAM procedure. See, however, section 3.4.2 for a discussion of the force-field limitations of Mg2+ description. Another interesting possibility is to combine US with replica exchange. This approach was used in a study where US was used not to progressively steer the system from one structure to
another but to penalize stable rotamers.273 A ladder of replicas was then constructed in which the degree of destabilization was progressively increased. While this method is technically implemented by imposing a bias potential on selected degrees of freedom, its spirit closely resembles that of T-REMD, solute
tempering, and, in general, H-REMD. Indeed, the number of concurrently biased CVs can be very large, and very little a priori knowledge about the transitions to be enhanced is required. An extension of this idea in which metadynamics is used to adaptively construct penalizing potentials has been called replica exchange with collective variable tempering
(RECT),259 and has been applied to the conformational
sampling of oligonucleotides.143,144,152,259 Here, a large number of CVs is chosen, and a bias potential designed to flatten their histogram is iteratively constructed. To avoid the difficulties of constructing a high dimensional histogram, the CVs are assumed to be independent when constructing this potential. This potential thus typically disfavors sampling of minima. To reconstruct an unbiased ensemble, the strength of this biasing potential is gradually modified along a ladder of replicas. The ladder of replicas is constructed by modulating the bias factor γ (see above) of WT-metadynamics, which allows for a progressively increasing partial flattening of the individual
histograms across the ladder.308 The use of metadynamics in the construction of penalizing potentials allows simulations to be performed with very limited a priori knowledge. The metadynamics principle is here used to increase dynamics in the high-bias replicas, while the unbiased replica is again used to collect the unbiased populations, that is, the thermodynamic data, as in most REMD schemes. Metadynamics can be also combined with replica exchange in a framework where the value of some observable averaged across the replicas is restrained so as to agree with experimental
data (replica averaged metadynamics, or RAM).345 This approach can be used to partially compensate for force-field inaccuracies by forcing the system to reproduce experimental,

for example, NMR, data and simultaneously enhance sampling. RAM has been used to characterize low-population states of a
TAR RNA−peptide complex346 and a UUCG tetraloop347 (see section 4.7.5). In both applications, experimental residual
dipolar couplings were enforced using a tensor-free method.348 The problem of such applications is that available primary experimental data might be, in some cases, not sufficient to overcome or suppress the limitations related to the force-field inadequacies. Importance sampling techniques can also be combined with MSM through the transition-based reweighting analysis method
(TRAM). Recently proposed in its most general version,349 TRAM makes it possible to combine multiple biased simulations (such as those usually analyzed with weighted histogram methods) with unbiased simulations to reconstruct the full thermodynamics and kinetics of the system. Briefly, the idea of the method is to define different “thermodynamic ensembles”, one for each bias condition, including the unbiased ensemble. Each of these ensembles is divided into microstates and treated as a single MSM. The parameters of these MSMs are computed from likelihood maximization by solving a system of equations that couples the different ensembles. Under certain conditions, it is possible to obtain unbiased bidirectional rates of a transition even if the transition in the unbiased simulations was observed only in one direction. This approach is thus a promising tool for studying kinetics of conformational changes between states with very different stabilities for which transitions in one of the two directions cannot be sampled in a feasible time with unbiased MD simulations. A closely related method was subsequently introduced and applied to study
RNA duplex formation350 using the oxRNA coarse-grained
model351,352 (see also section 3.3).
3.2.7. Alchemical Methods. All of the enhanced sampling methods discussed above are designed to allow MD simulations to realize conformational changes that would require a very long time to be observed in unbiased simulations. These methods essentially induce transitions by forcing the system through unlikely paths and allow the effect of this forcing to be discounted a posteriori. However, similar methods can be used to compute free-energy differences between systems with different numbers or types of particles. Here, the role of the CV is played by some control parameter λ that continuously converts a given potential energy function to another one. One classic historical example is conversion between an ion and a
neutral atom (neon),353 which can ultimately allow the solvation free energy of an ion to be evaluated. Simulations of this kind are called alchemical simulations because they allow the user to interconvert between atoms of different types and annihilate or create atoms, that is, to perform chemical transformations. An excellent introduction to alchemical
methods has been published.354 Note that in modern computations of ion hydration energies, the ions are typically completely annihilated (alchemical ion to nothing transformation) in a two-stage process. In the first stage (charge neutralization), the ion’s charge is slowly neutralized, and in the second stage (disappearing), the vdW potentials are slowly removed. This approach has been used, for example, to derive
vdW force-field parameters of ions.355 A prototypical method of this class is thermodynamic integration (TI), in which simulations are performed for a set of values of the control parameter conventionally ranging between 0 and 1, where the end points correspond to the chemical species considered. For each simulation, the derivative
of the total free energy of the system with respect to the control parameter is computed, and, by integration, one can obtain the free-energy difference. The TI method has a clear conceptual relationship to umbrella sampling (US) simulations that are performed with multiple restraints and combined using WHAM (see section 3.2.5). In both cases, multiple simulations are performed at intermediate steps along the transition (or transformation). The TI method could thus suffer from problems similar to those of the US method. For instance, if simulations at different values of the control parameter are initialized (seeded) by unidirectionally increasing the parameter’s value, the estimate of the free-energy difference might be affected by a systematic error. Simulations initialized with an inverted protocol should have a systematic error of the opposite sign, and could thus be used for validation. In the context of TI,
this effect is known as “Hamiltonian lagging”.356 Another alchemical method that has applicability similar to that of TI is the free-energy perturbation method (FEP). Instead of performing the alchemical change in small steps as in the TI protocol, one might perform it in a single step by running a single simulation. This would be made using the potential energy function (Hamiltonian) corresponding to the initial state (A) and virtually replacing it with that of the final state (B). In other words, one runs a normal simulation for state (Hamiltonian) A, but for each counted configuration the energy corresponding to state B is also computed. This can be
done in the formally exact framework of FEP.357,358 However, the statistical efficiency of this procedure is limited by the fact that initial and final states should be significantly over
lapping.359 For this reason, it is more common to see FEP applications where the change is performed in stages, using series of intermediate states between A and B, as in the TI protocol. In addition, similarly to the other “directional” methods, using simulations in both directions of the transformation (from A to B and from B to A) leads to a significant cancellation of error that makes the procedure statistically more
reliable.360 As with multiple-restraint US, the safest approach to TI and FEP may be to use a replica-exchange framework in which simulations at different values of the control parameter are performed simultaneously and coordinate swaps are attempted
from time to time.361 For instance, Sakuraba et al. used this approach to compute the free-energy impact of base pair
substitution in canonical A-RNA362 (see section 4.3.3). In the case of TI or FEP, this approach actually makes it possible to verify the existence of continuous trajectories through the space defined by the control parameter. In any transformations of atoms or chemical groups, the control parameters should affect both the charges on the atoms and their vdW interactions. As mentioned above, it is strongly recommended to nullify the partial charges on the atoms before modifying their Lennard-Jones parameters to prevent a singularity in the electrostatic term when the atoms start to overlap. This procedure is known as a two-step transformation. The vdW term also presents some technical difficulties related to the divergence of the 1/r12 potential, which makes the integral numerically difficult to solve. In other words, there is a visible effect of the singularity that occurs at interatomic distances close to r = 0, which are encountered (sampled) at the very end of any disappearing process and at the beginning of any creation process. This problem is nowadays usually addressed by employing so-called soft-core potentials while decoupling or annihilating Lennard-Jones interactions. Soft

core potentials guarantee finite pairwise interaction energies for all configurations and thus prevent singularities and instabilities that would otherwise occur at the end points of the TI
path;354,363,364 for more information, see also http://www. alchemistry.org/wiki/Best_Practices. Note that the potential energy functions used in MD are always defined up to an arbitrary constant, so that the physical quantities that can be compared to experiments are always differences between states with the same number and types of particles. Figure 19 shows a thermodynamics cycle, which
allows one to analyze the effect of base substitutions on the stability of an RNA duplex. The free-energy effect of substituting an AU base pair by a GC base pair in a double helix is defined as a difference (ΔΔG) between duplex formation free energies (ΔG) with the original and mutated sequence. Calculations of free energies of duplex formation processes are very challenging because they require hybridization and dehybridization to be sampled multiple times to provide a converged result. In contrast, it is much more convenient to make alchemical calculations of the mutations
within the duplex and single-strand contexts, as shown in Figure 19. The resulting ΔΔG values can then be compared to experiment. In some cases, equivalent ΔΔG values can be obtained using enhanced sampling methods such as those described in the previous sections, where a physical trajectory is simulated between the ending states. However, there are cases where the physical process of interest is difficult to simulate, and it is more convenient to simulate the “alchemical legs” of the thermodynamics cycle. This is also the case of the ion hydration free energies. We cannot easily study the physical process of the immersion of an ion into water from gas phase, as it could only be directly calculated by simulating a water/ vacuum interface, which would require a huge simulation box. However, one can relatively easily calculate the free energy associated with the creation of the same ion in water (and in the gas phase) from nothing. The thermodynamics cycle is then trivially completed by immersing “nothing” into water. TI has been used to compute free-energy changes associated with chemical modification of one or more nucleobases in RNA systems, for instance, to quantify the effect of replacing a guanine−cytosine canonical base pair proximal to a noncanonical A/G base pair with an isoguanine−isocytosine
(isoGisoC) base pair.365 Isoguanine and isocytosine have their amino and carbonyl groups transposed relative to guanine and cytosine, so the substitution is entirely isosteric (see section 2). The work compared the stabilities of duplexes with two different arrangements of the A/G base pairs. In this case, all of the TI computations for the thermodynamics cycle were performed on duplexes, with no need for any single-strand computations. This is because the calculations studied the response of the A/G geometry to the substitution. A comparison with NMR data revealed only modest agreement between theory and experiment. This could be perhaps related to the use of the ff99 AMBER force field. Further, the authors attempted a modification of the force field to account for amino
group nonplanarity,365 to capture out of plane H-bonds involving unpaired guanine amino group in the anti−anti conformation of the A/G base pair with the adjacent base
pairs.106 This work is in more detail described in section 4.3.3. TI computations can also be used to quantify how a mutation would affect stability of a folded structure of a biomolecule. In this case, one might use TI to introduce the mutation in both the folded and the unfolded structures. This means to simulate conformationally very different states, similarly to the case shown in Figure 19. In an example of this approach, mutations from guanine to inosine were alchemically induced in a sequence containing a GCAA tetraloop in its native
structure.366 To quantify the mutation’s effect on the system’s stability, the authors also computed the free-energy change associated with the mutation, considering the guanine in the context of small fragments that were used as models for the unfolded state (either a single nucleoside, a trinucleotide, or a pentanucleotide). Use of these small models allowed one to avoid performing difficult calculations on a longer flexible ssRNA. The authors reported both forward and backward protocols so as to provide lower and upper bounds for the results, which were in reasonable agreement with available thermodynamic data. Another interesting case is the use of TI to quantify the effect of a guanine-to-inosine substitution on the stability of a canonical duplex, which was performed with the χOL3 force
field.367 The free-energy differences of duplex dimerizations caused by the guanine-to-inosine substitutions were derived via
Figure 19. A scheme representing the procedure required to compute the effect of substitution of an AU base pair with a GC base pair on the stability of a short duplex. Alchemical transformations can be used to compute ΔGDSAU→GC (lower panels) by simulating the dsRNA. Similarly, an alchemical transformation can be used to compute ΔGSSAU→GC (upper panels) within the ssRNAs. Because free
energy is a state function, the difference between these two numbers is equal to the difference in the stability of duplexes with AU and G C base pairs in the mutated position. In other words, one computes the processes along the horizontal arrows to obtain the free-energy difference for processes marked by the vertical arrows exploiting the
relationship ΔGDSAU→GC + ΔGDS→SSGC = ΔGDS→SSAU + ΔGSSAU→GC;
that is, ΔΔGDS→SSAU→GC = ΔGDS→SSAU − ΔGDS→SSGC = ΔGDSAU→GC −
ΔGSSAU→GC. This protocol allows one to circumvent the explicit simulation of the transition between a dsRNA and two ssRNAs, that is, of the duplex formation, which would be very challenging. However, even when simulating the alchemical changes along the horizontal arrows, one must make sure that both the dsRNA and the ssRNA states are extensively sampled. As we will see in section 4.1, sampling a flexible single-stranded oligonucleotide is far from trivial.

thermodynamic cycles using alchemical TI guanine-to-inosine mutations in the context of duplex and single-strand RNAs (Figure 19). ssRNAs are flexible in solution and, as discussed in section 4.1, are very challenging systems on their own. However, in this work, possibly because the simulations were relatively short (∼20 ns), the simulated single strands remained structurally stable and allowed the authors to calculate freeenergy changes with small statistical errors. The calculated ΔΔG values were within ∼1 kcal/mol of the experimental results, which is an excellent agreement given the approximations used. A similar calculation was reported for the CG
→ isoCisoG substitution.138 In this case, the difference between ff99 simulations and experimental data was on the order of 12 kcal/mol. This difference was reduced to an average of 2 kcal/mol using the Amber99TOR reparameterization designed by the authors. An important difference between the Amber99 and Amber99TOR force field relevant in this context could be the parameterization of the glycosidic torsion, similarly to the χOL3 force field (see section 3.1.2.1). The
Amber99TOR potential, which modifies also several other dihedrals, was later shown to be suboptimal for A-RNA double
helices.58 TI was also used to examine the effect of the Arg142Ala substitution on RNA binding in the SRSF1 RNA recognition motif 2 (RRM2) protein. The computed result was in good agreement with data from isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) experiments.368 In yet another study, the same authors used TI to evaluate the influence of two hydration sites reported in simulations of the Fox-1 RRM on protein/RNA binding affinity. The hydration sites were abolished by alanine mutations of the water-coordinating residues Ser155 and Ser122. Good agreement with experiment was obtained for
the Ser155Ala mutant but not for Ser122Ala.369 More details on these results are reported in section 4.7.2.2. Note that in both studies, the effect of mutations in the unbound system was evaluated in the protein. This might have contributed to the reported agreement between experiments and TI calculations because the unbound proteins had a well-defined folded structure that could be properly sampled in the simulation’s time scale. This is often very difficult to achieve for flexible single-stranded RNA molecules (see section 4.1). As a closing comment about alchemical methods, it should be noted that the control variable used to induce the transition is not always capable of properly describing the different possible substates of the system. In other words, using the language of the enhanced sampling methods discussed above, it would not be necessarily a good CV. For instance, if the mutation of a nucleobase is coupled with a syn/anti flip in the glycosidic bond, it is very unlikely that a TI procedure that only alchemically converts one base into another would capture the correct free-energy change. In general, one can assume that accuracy of the TI method is optimal in case of simple modifications, such as purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine transformations, which are not associated with significant conformational changes. This means, for example, a substitution of one canonical base pair by another in an A-RNA helix without interchanging the purine and pyrimidine positions. Reliability of alchemical computations is expected to deteriorate sharply if more challenging substitutions are attempted. It may be possible to partially alleviate these problems by combining alchemical methods with enhanced sampling techniques such as those discussed earlier. For more
studies using alchemical approaches, see also sections 4.3.3, 4.3.9, 4.5.3, and 4.7.2.
3.2.8. Continuum Solvent Methods, MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA. In all of the methods that we discussed in the preceding sections, free-energy difference is computed by enforcing real or “alchemical” transitions between one conformation (state) and the other. To get converged results with methods such as metadynamics, multiple transitions need to be realized. Similarly, when using methods such as US simulations with multiple restraints, the separate simulations that one performs must bridge in a continuous manner from one state to another. This is required to avoid explicit calculation of the partition function of the system, which, in turn, would require averaging over all degrees of freedom of the system. However, if one were able to average the Boltzmann weights on a significant number of degrees of freedom, a direct calculation of the free-energy difference might be feasible. For example, because a large fraction of the binding free energy between two molecules depends on their interaction with the solvent, an explicit calculation might be possible by integrating over solvent degrees of freedom. This can be done using implicit solvent models. Thus, free-energy differences can also be calculated with the help of continuum solvent approaches. A typical application is computation of affinity between two molecules, for example, between nucleic acid molecule and protein or ligand. The approach can also be used to compute free-energy differences between different conformations (states) of the same molecule or to monitor free energies along MD simulation trajectories. The main advantage of these methods is that it is sufficient to simulate only the end states. Most common implicit solvent models used in this context evaluate polar and nonpolar parts to the solvation free energy separately. The polar part is computed by assigning to each atom a radius within which the dielectric constant is assumed to be different from that of the solvent. The system is then described by Poisson−Boltzmann equation that is solved either numerically on a grid (Poisson−Boltzmann method, PB) or analytically in an approximate fashion (generalized Born method, GB). The nonpolar part of the solvation free energy is estimated from a surface area (SA), resulting in so-called GBSA and PBSA implicit solvation models. Within their approximations, PBSA and GBSA allow one to compute the absolute solvation free energy of a molecule. For a review of implicit solvation methods for biomolecular systems, see ref 370. A particularly popular approach based on the combination of PBSA (or GBSA) methods with explicit solvent MD is called
MM-PBSA (or MM-GBSA).371 When calculating free energies of two different states of a molecule, separate MD simulations in explicit solvent are performed for the two investigated conformations, without the need to simulate any transition between them. For each trajectory, one then extracts a number of snapshots including only the coordinates of the solute. For all of these frames, the solvation free energy is then computed using either PBSA or GBSA, whereas the solute energy is computed with the used atomistic force field. Free energy is thus estimated combining the solute force field energy and the solvation free energy. Finally, the free-energy difference between the two states is estimated by means of averaging the energies over all of the snapshots representing each state. Some applications of this technique to RNA systems are described in other parts of this Review. For binding free energies, the continuum solvent calculations are executed

separately for the complex and the two monomers, and can be performed processing either a single MD simulation of the whole complex (single-trajectory approach) or using separate simulations of the complex and the monomers (multiple
trajectory approach).371,372 The MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA calculations are exceptionally popular because they are easy to execute. One just needs to run a standard explicit-solvent all-atom MD simulation, then strip off the solvent, and, finally, add the solvation free-energy terms using the continuum solvent model. The method is essentially an a posteriori treatment of explicit-solvent simulations with a continuum solvent model. A key advantage is that one simulates only the end states of the studied processes and not the actual transitions. However, the use of continuum solvent models brings additional major approximations into the computations, which stem from their fundamental physical limitations. A cardinal problem of all continuum solvation models is the enormous sensitivity of computed solvation free energies to various parameters of the calculations such as the assumed atomic radii. In reality, these methods can be trained for rather narrow sets of molecules, but there is no generally valid (universal) set of parameters. This sensitivity to parameterization applies to both classical and QM-based continuum solvent models, irrespective of their
specific formulation.114,373−376 For studies demonstrating the
limitations, see refs 372−374, 377, and 378. Note also that, due to the limitations of continuum solvent models, we do not recommend MD simulations of highly charged nucleic acids using continuum solvent approaches. 3.3. Coarse-Grained Models of RNA
Although the feasible time scales of all-atom MD simulations of biomolecules have increased impressively in recent decades, and enhanced sampling methods allow even longer time scales to be accessed at least in some cases, there are many phenomena that still cannot be efficiently studied by atomistic MD. Biologically interesting processes such as the folding of RNA structures or the domain motions of ribosomal subunits during translocation can develop over time scales of the order of milliseconds or longer, and might also involve millions of atoms or more. Atomistic simulations of these systems therefore usually demand a rather large or even prohibitive computational effort, necessitating the use of alternative approaches. One such alternative is to use simplified, coarsegrained (CG) descriptions. These procedures usually involve reducing the degrees of freedom of the original atomistic system by grouping selected sets of atoms and representing them as a smaller set of CG particles (also called beads) that interact through effective energy functions. This reduction reduces the complexity of the calculation, and, in general, defines a smoother energy surface, which can be explored more

quickly and using a larger integration time step. In consequence, larger systems and longer times can be simulated. 3.3.1. General Considerations about Coarse Graining. There is no unique way of defining a CG representation and its interactions. Accordingly, they are usually tailored to suit the characteristics of the phenomena under investigation. For example, some parameterizations focus on reproducing the distribution functions between the CG sites sampled during
atomistic MD simulations.379−384 These approaches can be practical both for enhancing the exploration of the conformational space and for recovering atomistic resolution in a later step. The quality of their approximations of course depends on the reliability of the atomistic simulations used in their parameterizations. Alternative versions of these methods use sets of experimental structures to obtain such distributions; the
resulting models are said to be “knowledge-based”.385,386 This option is in some ways less rigorous, but is particularly useful when atomistic MD sampling is cumbersome or simply unreliable. Models may also be constructed by adjusting selected parameters of a predefined set of energy functions, with the aim of reproducing experimental quantities such as
free energies.387,388 Because of the used approximations, CG models will generally only faithfully reproduce a specific set of observables in a limited region around the conditions (thermodynamic and nonthermodynamic) assumed in their parameterization. Therefore, these approaches must be used with care, and may sometimes require a redefinition of the observables of interest
based on the model’s resolution.389 However, if the model’s limitations are understood and respected, CG simulations can provide important insights that complement atomistic MD simulations or help explain experimental observations. Because CG models allow much broader sampling of the conformational space than all-atom simulations, it is attractive to combine the CG and all-atom methods, with the CG
methods scouting the free-energy landscape and the atomistic methods subsequently refining the CG exploration. A prerequisite of such combined approaches is the capability to reconstruct atomistic models from the CG explorations, which could be used to seed atomistic simulations. The relation between various CG energy functions and atomistic MD force fields is not straightforward. The empirical force fields used in atomistic simulations are sometimes referred to as “physics-based” models. However, the term “physics-based” is quite arbitrary: many quantum chemists would vigorously dispute the claim that atomistic force fields offer a physics-based description because they are entirely empirical. An atomistic force field can be seen as an “unphysical” coarse graining of the true electronic structure. However, we usually expect atomistic MD simulations to be capable of simultaneously describing the structural dynamics, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the studied biopolymers, as long as no chemical reactions are involved. Conversely, when using CG approaches, we can only expect predictions of a limited set of properties of the studied RNA systems under a narrow range of conditions. Despite their apparent primitiveness, CG models may benefit substantially from the compensation of errors, to the extent that a given CG force field may, in certain cases, be more accurate than a “multipurpose” atomistic force field. Below, we provide an overview of the principal CG descriptions that have been proposed for simulating RNA. These models can be used for various purposes including predicting the thermodynamics or native structure of an RNA system, or modeling large domain motions using a so-called Elastic Network Model (ENM). A brief summary of these features is shown in Table 2 where each method is listed with the number of CG beads per nucleotide in its representation (when applicable), the number of nucleotides of the largest structure studied under the CG representation, the properties

that the model has been designed to reproduce or have been studied with it, and the interactions considered in the model. CG methods use diverse representations, as illustrated in Figures 20 and 21, depending on the level of resolution
required for the properties they are designed to address. For example, they can represent a nucleotide by a spherical bead for a low-resolution treatment of a large structure, or replace it by a small set of bonded particles, which allow the definition of its internal structure and the introduction of more complex interactions. In the same manner, the interactions between these elements can be of different nature, although they might be described with similar representations, as in the case of structure-prediction models, which allow one to explore a large number of conformations, and ENMs, which have fixed secondary and tertiary structures by construction. We will focus on both aspects when describing a CG model. It is worth
noting that, although the thermodynamics of folding is closely related to the problem of structure prediction, the latter is generally tackled using parameterizations and methods that do not necessarily have a direct physical meaning. As an example, Figure 22 shows the free-energy and energy landscape of two pseudoknot structures obtained with different methods: the

TIS,390 parameterized with experimental free energies, and a
knowledge-based approach, SimRNA.391 The classification presented here is intended to shed light on the properties that can be faithfully reproduced and/or have been addressed using these approaches, and to guide readers who want to focus on a particular problem but lack knowledge of the field. A similar approach was adopted in the excellent review by
Dawson et al.,392 but their classification was based on the types of input parameters used to design the interactions rather than the applicability of the resulting CG model.
3.3.2. Models Reporting Thermodynamic and Physical Properties. Several models have been parameterized to reproduce the thermodynamics of folding and the free-energy landscape. These works are often built on earlier efforts to model secondary RNA structures, which provided a foundation for the parameterization or validation of the three-dimensional models. An important approach of this type is the nearest
neighbor (NN) model,44,436−442 which approximates the free energy of the structure as a sum of contributions from steps of consecutive stacked base pairs, including separate terms for dangling ends, bulges, and hairpins. Its parameterization is based on experimental thermodynamic measurements of a large number of oligonucleotides. However, as a tool for evaluating the free energy of a given secondary structure and its melting temperature, it does not provide any information on the system’s three-dimensional structure. To obtain a complete description of folding, it would be necessary to use a threedimensional representation of the nucleotides. In addition, the interactions between the nucleotides should be defined in terms of stacking and base-pairing contributions, which are not fully distinguished in the NN model. Many of the models reviewed here use similar arguments or are parameterized using a consistent set of experimental data, and focus on reproducing the thermodynamics, melting curves, and possibly the salt dependency of the stability of hairpins, duplexes, and pseudoknots, among other types of RNA structures. In some cases, certain mechanical properties have been reported as well.
The Vfold model proposed by Cao and Chen394,395 uses an estimate of the free energy based on NN parameters. It decomposes a secondary structure into arrays of stacked pairs and unstacked loops. The free energy of the stacks is estimated using the NN parameters, while the free energy of the loops is derived from their entropic contribution, which is calculated on the basis of an exhaustive exploration of self-avoiding random walks in a diamond lattice representation. The RNA chains were initially modelled using beads situated at the positions of the C4′ and P atoms, while the conformations were defined by the dihedral angles along the chains in this reduced description.
In a newer version of this approach,393 beads located at the positions of the N9 atom for purines and N1 for pyrimidines were added to account for the effect of base orientation on loop entropy. From the estimation of the partition function and the free energy of the allowed conformations, it is possible to predict the lowest free-energy secondary structure, and to obtain properties such as the specific heat. Using this approach and further extensions, it was possible to study the
thermodynamics of specific regions in ribozymes,394,395,397
several kinds of pseudoknots,393 and kissing-loops.396 The three-dimensional representation is obtained a posteriori by assigning the aforementioned CG representation to each of the predicted secondary structures with the help of a motif template database. Finally, atomistic details are introduced into this low-resolution scaffold and refined by energy
minimization using the AMBER force field80 in explicit solvent. Free energies can also be obtained using the MFOLD
parameters.443
Go̅ models444 are descriptions that favor a particular
reference (target) structure (see also section 3.1.2.5). They
have been widely used in the study of protein folding.445 They typically make use of CG descriptions for the residues of a macromolecule, including bonded interactions along the chains and other nonbonded contributions of physical origin. The reference structure is favored by the inclusion of specific interactions associated with native contacts, which are pairs of CG particles separated by a distance smaller than a preassigned cutoff in the reference molecule. The folding pathway of RNA hairpins has been studied using an approach of this kind in which each nucleotide was represented by three particles (one each for the base, sugar, and phosphate group) by Hyeon and
Thirumalai.446 The interaction terms of these models include bonds, angles, and dihedrals to preserve the connectivity of stacked base pairs and the energetics of their interaction; the parameters used for these terms are directly adjusted on the
basis of experimental free-energy data.44,441 In addition, electrostatic interactions are included using Debye−Hückel terms, and there are additional nonbonded interactions including attractive contributions for native contacts and purely repulsive terms for non-native ones. This model has been used to study the nature of the folding transitions in terms of the temperature and force applied to the end sugars of the hairpin, calculate hopping and refolding times for different temperatures, forces, and initial conditions, and to analyze in detail the
refolding by force-quenching.446,447 In a subsequent work, the same group proposed a simpler representation, the self
organized polymer (SOP) model,448 for studying the unfolding and refolding pathways of hairpins, ribozymes, and ribos
witches.448,449 This representation features one particle per nucleotide, with a set of interactions consisting uniquely of nonlinear bonds along the backbone, attractive and repulsive energy terms for native contacts, and exclusively repulsive terms for non-native ones. Some of the parameters that define these energy functions are determined from experimental structures, while others were adjusted to prevent interchain crossing. An approach with more rigorous interactions was introduced in a later contribution focusing on the study of RNA folding.
The three interaction sites (TIS) model390 proposed by Denesyuk and Thirumalai represents each nucleotide with three particles, one each for the sugar ring, phosphate group, and base. The interaction energies are defined in terms of bonds, angles, excluded volume, stacking, base-pairing, and electrostatic forces. The terms used to describe these interactions are based on experimental measurements of the free energies of interactions for a large set of pairs of stacked
base pairs.438 A series of assumptions is used to decompose these measurements into independent enthalpic and entropic contributions for canonical base pairing and nucleobase-specific stacking interactions. This decomposition can be used to estimate the melting temperatures for every possible combination of stacked dimers, which are used to parameterize the interaction energies together with the experimental melting curve of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) pseudoknot and the stability of two hairpin structures. In this representation, all hydrogen bonds are assumed to make identical energetic contributions, and the bases have no internal structure. A hydrogen bond can be formed only if it is present in the hydrogen-bond network of the native structure. A later

version of the model allows the formation of canonical base pairs independently of the native contacts. Electrostatic repulsion is accounted for using Debye−Hückel theory, although the effective charge is based on counterion
condensation theory.450 The TIS model has been used to study the folding thermodynamics of the aforementioned pseudoknot (shown in Figure 22A) and two hairpins as a function of temperature and monovalent salt concentration, and for studying the relative stability of the hairpin and pseudoknot structures of the pseudoknot domain of telomerase
RNA under molecular crowding.398 The CG representation implemented in the discrete
molecular dynamics (DMD) algorithm by Ding et al.399 also uses the NN model to directly calibrate some of its interactions, and has been used to study the specific heat profiles of tRNAs, pseudoknots, and fragments of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mRNA. This representation describes each nucleotide using three particles as well, corresponding to the sugar, base, and phosphate group. There are specific terms for the electrostatic repulsion between phosphate groups, and hydrophobic, stacking, and hydrogen-bond interactions between bases. In addition, there is an explicit correction for the entropy of loop formation because it was found to be underestimated by this type of CG representation.
HiRe-RNA400−402 is a high-resolution CG model in which nucleotides containing purines and pyrimidines are modeled using seven and six beads, respectively: two corresponding to the phosphate group, three to the sugar ring, and the rest to the base. The authors reported specific heat curves for RNA duplexes, some of which included noncanonical base pairs. The force field of the HiRe-RNA model is quite sophisticated and includes local interactions accounting for local stereochemistry, an excluded volume interaction that gives the beads a physical size, and nonlocal interactions accounting for base pairing, base stacking, and electrostatics. Many (although not all) noncanonical RNA base pairs are represented. The set of interaction parameters was derived by analyzing around 200 structures from the PDB database, and refined on the basis of MD simulations. However, no quantitative correspondence between the simulated and real melting temperatures has yet been established. In the latest paper, the authors reported the successful folding of several tetraloops, pseudoknots, and quadruplexes. The representation also allows the reintroduction of atomistic details in a simple way, making possible a multiscale exploration of the conformational space. This is
the case, for example, of the work of Stadlbauer et al.,326 where the DNA variant of HiRe-RNA has been used for sampling configurations of DNA G-quadruplexes, while atomistic MD simulations have been used for obtaining further insight.
Jost and Everaers403 proposed a one-site-per-nucleotide representation on a face-centered-cubic lattice, using the NN model for the parameterization of its interactions. This limits the possible interactions between the nucleotides to canonical base pairs (including G/U wobble pairs, Figure 2G) and stacking interactions. The comparatively low resolution of the configuration space offered by this description is compensated for by a rigorous treatment of chain conformations and the expressions of its entropy. Their model has been used to calculate melting temperatures and estimate the specific heats of systems such as small hairpins, pseudoknots, and tRNAs with up to 80 nucleotides.
Another representation is naRES-2P,404 which uses interaction sites for the sugar ring, phosphate, and a base together
with its dipolar momentum. The phosphate’s position is defined in relation to the two closest sugars, which are directly connected by a bonded potential. In this model, base−base interactions are described using a combination of electric dipole and anisotropic Gay−Berne contributions. These interactions have an analytical form that was parameterized using the
AMBER energy function451 and experimental NN parame
ters.452 Backbone conformations are governed by knowledgebased expressions taken from a structural database. The model also includes phosphate−phosphate electrostatic repulsions. Although the original version of this model successfully reproduced the double-helix structures of DNA and RNA, an optimized version was proposed to improve the agreement of
the predicted melting curves with experiment.405
Starting from a known secondary structure, TOPRNA406 is a model composed of nucleotides represented by three particles standing for base, phosphate, and sugar groups. It uses a pseudotorsional description for the backbone conformations and takes into account canonical and wobble base pairs through knowledge-based potentials. Stacking interactions are parameterized on the basis of experimental free-energy data. All nucleotides belonging to stems are bonded with their neighbors to reproduce an A-form helix, while the rest of the unpaired nucleotides are allowed to rotate freely around the backbone, without feeling stacking or base-pairing interactions. The model is typically used to explore topological constraints on folding and dynamics, especially in bulges, and their contribution to the free energy. Calculations using this model have produced results in good agreement with low-salt experiments, suggesting that the topology plays an important role in determining the
free energy of bulges and junctions under these conditions.453
The oxRNA351,352 model (Figure 21A) describes each nucleotide as a rigid particle with multiple interaction centers, and allows formation of stacking and base pairs. In addition, it incorporates specific interactions for topologically linked nucleotides. Its interactions are parameterized by adjusting the melting temperatures of a set of short duplexes and hairpins using the predictions of the NN model. It has been used to study melting curves of duplexes and hairpins, and the effect of mismatched base pairs and bulges on their thermodynamics. In addition, it was used to study some important mechanical properties of duplexes such as their persistence length, elastic responses under the action of forces and overstretching, and their mechanical behavior under supercoiling conditions. Despite not being parameterized for these properties, the results obtained agree reasonably well with experimental data in general. Electrostatic interactions have been incorporated into the model using the Debye−Hückel theory, and effective charges for the phosphate groups were fitted to reproduce the experimental melting temperatures of selected RNA duplexes.
Ren and co-workers407−409 proposed the RACER model, which uses a five-bead representation of nucleotides. This mapping assigns two particles to the backbone (representing sugar and phosphate groups) and three to the bases, making it possible to define their orientations and the positions of interaction sites. Interactions are modeled using knowledgebased potentials that also incorporate excluded-volume interactions, electrostatics (in the form of a repulsive Debye− Hückel term between phosphate groups), and explicit hydrogen bonds between bases. Originally designed for structure prediction and modeling, the latest work on this method presented energy landscapes for 14 structures together with equilibrium pulling simulations on RNA duplexes (with

between 6 and 10 base pairs), hairpins (10−18 nucleobases), and the HIV TAR RNA, showing good agreement with experimental free energies.
Finally, the MARTINI force field454 is a systematic CG model designed for biomolecules. Its general approach is based on representing a set of four heavy atoms with their associated hydrogens by a single bead. The bonded interactions between these beads are adjusted to distributions sampled in all-atom MD simulations, while the nonbonded ones are parameterized using experimental values of partitioning free energies. This
procedure allowed CG simulations of proteins,455 carbohy
drates,456 and lipids.387 The parameterization has been
extended for modeling DNA and RNA molecules,410,411 making possible studies of interactions between RNA and proteins in a common framework. It is important to mention that the tertiary structure of the simulated RNA molecules is kept fixed by additional harmonic springs, so this approach is not intended for the study of folding properties. The authors have reported flexibilities of single- and double-stranded RNAs, which are in good agreement with all-atom MD results. They also evaluated the stability of RNA loops and systems involving the HuD protein, the protein 19 of the human signal recognition particle, and even the whole Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome. Also, they tested formation of protein/RNA complexes by performing simulations starting from an initial condition in which the protein and the RNA were separated by 1 nm. The aforementioned methods provide descriptions that in general take care of canonical base pairs, stacking, and electrostatics. Unfortunately, the parameterization of interactions in CG models on the basis of free energies requires a large amount of work, and given the paucity of data available involving noncanonical base pairs or base-phosphate interactions, these models are only capable of describing a few kinds of base pairs. They also impose restrictions on the backbone’s conformational space and ignore sugar pucker (in most cases) and glycosidic bond angles, which may significantly affect the predictability of the native fold for important motifs.
3.3.3. Models Designed Exclusively for Structure Prediction or Refinement. Several methods discussed in the previous section can be used to predict native 3D structures on the basis of sequence data alone. However, in folded RNAs, the interactions between bases, or those between bases, phosphates, and sugar groups, can be much more variable than those found in typical A-form RNA helices. In addition, an effective structure prediction tool must be able to sample the conformational space in an efficient manner, which can be easier to implement in low-resolution models of RNA, where the building blocks that compose a molecule are constituted by many nucleotides. Hence, it is sometimes necessary to use less rigorous approaches when parameterizing interactions to capture or refine more complex structural features. The methods described in this section generally aim to predict a “best energy” or most populated cluster structure according to a particular energy function, which accounts for various real interactions in a reasonably accurate and computationally affordable manner. In general, the temperatures used in these methods have no physical meaning, and so the conformational space sampled during a constant temperature simulation does not either, unlike the results of an atomistic MD simulation. Parameterizations of most methods in this class rely on extracting data from large data sets of 3D structures instead of being defined on the basis of experimental free energies or melting temperatures.
The early method developed by Malhotra et al.412 was proposed as a structure refinement tool (to be used in conjunction with experimental data) rather than a truly predictive algorithm. These authors presented a protocol for introducing details at three levels of resolution based on a previously known secondary structure and a set of experimental constraints. The high-resolution level represents a nucleotide by a single particle located at the position of the corresponding phosphorus atom. The next level represents hairpins and duplexes by five or more particles, while the lowest resolution level uses large spherical beads to represent these motifs. Because of the limited amount of information used in the design of the modeled topology, additional experimental data are usually required to guide the selection of the best structure from a set of candidates. The computation of energies in this model includes harmonic potentials for bonds, angles, and dihedrals, with the possibility of introducing constraints for shape and positional information from electron microscopy experiments through specific terms. These potentials are then used for enforcing 2D structure starting from several random walk chains. The method was designed for dealing with relatively large structures, such as tRNA and components of ribosomal subunits. Its features were implemented later in the
YUP package.413
NAST414 is another one-bead-per-site model in which each nucleotide is represented by a bead located at the coordinate of its C3′ atom. Like Malhotra’s method, it requires data on secondary structure and tertiary contacts as inputs. Its interactions are bond, angle, and dihedral potentials derived from knowledge-based approaches, with additional terms for fixing secondary and tertiary contacts. A large number of decoys is therefore created starting from random coils and circular conformations, which is later clustered and ranked according to the energy function. The method has been tested on yeast phenylananine tRNA and the 388 residue T. thermophilus group I intron. This model can also be complemented with smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) or solvent accessibility data to refine the results. In addition, it is also been used for proposing models of missing loops in crystal structures. Another method that makes use of the secondary structure is
Ernwin,415 a helix-centered model shown in Figure 21C. In this approach, stems are represented by cylinders, which are connected to each other by interior loops or multiloops, or simply end in a hairpin loop or the terminal residues. 2D structure is kept fixed during Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, while energy functions avoid clashes between stems. Tertiary contacts can be formed through stem−loop and loop−loop knowledge-based interactions, and an additional energy term dependent on the radius of gyration can guide the simulation toward conformations with realistic compactness. The method has been tested on several structures, with a number of nucleotides ranging from 63 to 298. An important part of its capabilities relies on its sampling scheme, which allows displacements of large RNA domains, motions that cannot be efficiently sampled under atomistic approaches. At a
similar level of resolution, RAGTOP416 builds 3D graphs from a given secondary structure. Junctions between helices are predicted first, and a subsequent simulated annealing optimizes the structure subjected to knowledge-based potentials. The scoring function contains terms for torsions and angles around internal loops, the total radius of gyration, and a specific treatment of pseudoknots. The method has been tested on a group of 10 riboswitches containing three- and four-way

junctions. In addition, kink turns can also be identified and
treated with a specific set of parameters.457
RNAkb417 is a knowledge-based approach that models nucleotides using five particles located at the positions of the P, C4′, C2, C4, and C6 atoms, giving the bases an appreciable degree of internal structure. Its interactions are statistical potentials taken from histograms between these mapping points over a set of experimental structures, and have been carefully designed to take a smooth, differentiable form that can be used for MD simulations. The same approach has also been used to parameterize an all-atom knowledge-based model that reflects distributions of all atom types present in the RNA molecule. The performance of these representations was evaluated by using them to define scoring functions for identifying the best candidate structure from a set including multiple decoys, on structures with a maximum of 76 nucleotides. Results obtained with the CG energy function were of a quality similar to those obtained with established all
atom scoring functions such as Rosetta.458 The all-atom version was better able to discriminate the native structure from a decoy set than the CG representation.
SimRNA391 is a model in which each nucleotide is represented by five beads corresponding to the sugar, the phosphate group, and a planar base. Its interactions are statistical potentials derived by sampling a curated set of experimental structures. The backbone representation utilizes the pseudodihedral conformational space, while the threeparticle representation of bases allows them to form directional interactions including stacking and both canonical and noncanonical base pairing. The simulation procedure involves exploration of the conformational space by means of Hamiltonian Replica Exchange or simple Monte Carlo simulations, selection of the lowest energy structures, and clustering, as shown in Figure 22B. The model allows blind prediction of large numbers of structures, having been tested on a benchmark set of more than 200 structures with a maximum of 189 nucleotides and usually recovering the system’s true secondary structure. In addition, if 2D structure obtained by some other means is available, it can be used to impose constraints to accelerate the simulation or guide the simulation toward a structure consistent with the available 2D structure data. This method has been particularly successful for folding of pseudoknots, correctly predicting both their 2D and 3D structures in the vast majority of cases. The method has been
implemented in the SimRNAweb server.459
More recently, the RNApps model presented by Li et al.418 introduced another five-particle-per-nucleotide representation, using two particles for the backbone (situated on the P and C4′ atoms) and three that represent a base with its orientation. In this simpler representation, the conformation of a chain is given by a set of torsion angles, which are obtained according to a knowledge-based CG probability distribution taking into account correlations between the consecutive torsions. This
method was inspired by the BARNACLE460 algorithm, and
makes use of the RASP419 scoring function to evaluate the energy during sampling and posterior refinement steps. It is intended to be used as a refinement tool, having been tested in a large number of small loops and junctions (with 20 or less nucleotides) belonging to ribosomal structures and 876 nonredundant structures, among others. One of its most remarkable features is its sampling efficiency.
Finally, the SPQR model420 uses a point particle to represent the phosphate and an anisotropic particle for the nucleoside, as
shown in Figure 20B. Its knowledge-based interactions are
inspired by the εSCORE scoring function,223 which deals exclusively with the geometrical arrangement of bases in the RNA, exploiting the unambiguous relationship between baseto-base positions and the overall arrangement of RNA structures. In this case, the base−base interactions are divided across the sugar, Watson−Crick, and Hoogsteen faces, allowing formation of both canonical and noncanonical planar base
pairs,39 and base−phosphate interactions.50 The interactions
are also reweighted on the basis of experimental data.39,50 In the same spirit, backbone is defined by a minimal set of interactions to avoid favoring the most frequent RNA conformations found in the PDB database. To this end, the model uses a specific treatment of sugar puckers and glycosidic bond torsion conformations, allowing it to fold several hairpins and tetraloops with high accuracy. The representation also permits construction of structures with atomistic detail by making use
of εRMSD,223 an advanced structural deviation measure that only considers the arrangement of the bases and their relative orientations. εRMSD is more suitable for describing similarity between RNA structures than standard RMSD after optimal
superposition.331 By minimizing εRMSD between the CGpredicted structure and the corresponding all-atom strands in a structure obtained by explicit solvent steered MD, one obtains an atomistic consistent structure that usually also has correct sugar pucker and glycosidic bond angle conformations. This procedure is closely related to the targeted MD approach (see section 3.2.5), and the target structure is here given by the CG model prediction.
The high-resolution HiRe-RNA model400−402 introduced in section 3.3.2 is also being developed with the aim of creating a tool for predicting 3D RNA structures and folding pathways by exploiting its ability to mimic key noncanonical base pairs. However, some base pairs and base−phosphate interactions remain to be incorporated into the model. Similarly, the DMD model has also been used as a structure prediction tool, correctly predicting 150 of 153 nontrivial structures. This
method is also available online through the iFold web server.461
The RACER407−409 model discussed in the preceding section has also been used for the blind prediction of 14 structures with 30 nucleotides or less, achieving reasonable accuracy. In addition, the authors were able to introduce restraints reflecting known 2D structures and the presence of coordinated Mg2+ ions, and proposed a refinement method for structures of more than 100 nucleotides that can either use distance constraints from NMR data or comparisons between experimental data and calculated SAXS profiles for a set of candidate structures obtained by simulated annealing of a random coil. Vfold can also be used as a structure prediction tool, in particular through
its web server implementation.462 Capabilities of several of the above-described methods have been tested against other approaches in the RNA-Puzzles
challenge,463−465 a competition involving blind predictions of the three-dimensional structures of given sequences. Authors of the Vfold, SimRNA, and DMD models have participated very actively in this challenge, as have the creators of other all-atom
methods such as FARFAR,458 RNABuilder,466 MC-Fold/MC
Sym pipeline,467 and RNA123.468 Although most of the predictions are performed using hybrid approaches that involve experimental inputs, constraints for 2D structures, and all-atom refinements among other things, the CG models have made important contributions to the predictions when they have been used, and in some cases they have outperformed the

available alternatives. For example, SimRNA was used effectively as a refinement tool in combination with
ModeRNA469 and other tools, and was particularly successful in predicting the structure of a self-assembling RNA square and the bound state of the L-glutamine riboswitch. In a similar
manner, Vfold394,395 provided the best result for folding of the SAM-I riboswitch and an 84 nt glycine riboswitch domain, for which the DMD method also yielded good results. However, despite some notable successes, predicting RNA 3D structures remains far from trivial, even though known native structures are often used while training the parameterization of the CG models. Particularly, it is very difficult to capture rare backbone conformations, noncanonical base pairs, base−phosphate, and base−sugar interactions, and other features that do not appear frequently in structural databases. Further, many RNA molecules may only adopt their native structures upon interacting with appropriate oligopeptides or proteins. Additionally, it is not trivial to reintroduce atomistic details into the predicted structures, that is, to convert the structure predicted by the CG approach into an atomistic structure. This is required if atomistic insight is needed or if the predicted structures are to be used as starting points for further atomistic MD simulations.
3.3.4. Elastic Network Models. If a reference structure is
available, Elastic Network Models (ENMs)470 are simple tools for studying RNA dynamics based on the interconnectivity of the residues of a macromolecule. They map nucleotides onto a reduced set of particles that are bonded to all of their neighbors within a predefined cutoff radius by elastic potentials. The contact map associated with the native structure is thus enforced in the model so that the molecule cannot depart from it (Figure 20). Despite their simplicity, calculations of the normal modes of these representations can be useful for distinguishing between flexible and rigid domains inside a macromolecule, and even for inferring its catalytic activity using
this information.471,472 Given their great efficiency and
extensive application to proteins,473−476 ENMs are also applicable to protein/RNA complexes, and can generally deal with structures containing thousands of nucleotides. They also provide room for variability in terms of the cutoff of the interactions, the values of the spring constants, their dependence on separation of the particles in the equilibrium structure, and (of course) the choice of mapping sites. One of the first applications of ENM methods to RNA was
reported by Bahar and Jernigan.423 In their approach, one or two beads per nucleotide (standing for P or P and O4′ atoms, respectively) were used to identify hinge regions in tRNA and in the complex formed by tRNA and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. ENMs using the same mapping were also used to study large-scale motions relevant to ribosomal function by
Wang et al. (one or two beads),424 Kurkcuoglu et al. (one
bead),425 and by Tama et al. (one bead),426 who complemented the ENM analysis with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. This method has also been used to study the dynamics of tRNA in isolation and when attached to the
ribosome or a synthase.427
Zimmermann and Jernigan428 investigated the correspondence between the normal modes of ENMs and the principal components (PCs) of the apparent motion extracted from ensembles of experimental structures. Their study used a set of 16 ensembles of at least 5 structures having between 22 and 170 nucleotides, with particular emphasis on tRNA structures. The performance of each model was analyzed using different
representations with between one and three particles per nucleotide, located at the positions of one or more of the P, C2′, and O4′ positions. Additionally, they analyzed several options for representing the dependency of the spring constant between two particles and their equilibrium distance, finding that the results obtained were less sensitive to this parameter than is the case when simulating proteins. They also observed good agreement between the relative amplitude of motion for each atom and metrics that compare how the particles fluctuate in each direction as the cutoff distance in the CG representation is increased. In a later step, they compared different approaches for performing the alignment of the structures, which is a fundamental aspect in the determination of the PCs. Finally, the authors proposed a method for RMSD minimization and structure alignment that uses only those atoms that exhibit small fluctuations in the ENMs. It was found that this approach yielded more consistent results than the available alternatives when comparing the overlap between PCs and normal modes for different nucleotide representations. ENM approaches have also been used in smaller systems, for
example, to study unfolding pathways of riboswitches,429 and to analyze conformational space of a specific sequence, the CUG
repeat, at different resolutions, including all-atom networks.430 The performance of ENMs has also been compared to that of all-atom simulations and normal-mode analysis (NMA). Van
Wynsberghe and Cui158 found that ENMs describe the dynamics of the hammerhead ribozyme less well than higher resolution approaches. A more compact structure, the guanine riboswitch, exhibits better results under the ENM representation. These authors performed a mapping over phosphorus atoms, and ran their MD simulations for rather short times
(12.5 ns). Similar findings were reported by Besseova et al.,431 who studied three three-way junctions extracted from the large ribosomal subunits using all-atom MD and compared the results obtained to data from ENM calculations and a block
analysis using the ElNemo software package.432 They found that for the GTPase associated center part of 23S rRNA ENM failed to predict the hinge region observed by all-atom MD at the three-way junction. Further, the all-atom NMA did not properly describe the system’s motions and was in addition computationally inefficient. The authors argued that the failure might be due to the noncompactness of the studied domain. The physical nature of ENM models may make them more efficient at depicting the dynamics of globular molecules because their interaction potentials reflect the density of
particles around each residue.158,431 A few works have sought to optimize the representations used in ENMs, mostly comparing the resulting fluctuations to
those obtained from MD simulations.158,421,422 In particular,
the work of Setny and Zacharias421 suggested that an optimal model with a single bead per nucleotide could be obtained by placing the bead on the geometric center of the sugar. This
result was confirmed by the analysis of Pinamonti et al.,422 who compared MD simulations of a set of structures with a number noncanonical pairs to ENM simulations. These authors showed that more accurate representations can be obtained by increasing the number of beads, and suggested that the optimal representation has three beads per nucleotide, corresponding to the sugar, the base, and the phosphate. It should be noted that fluctuations obtained from ENMs can also be compared to experimental results. Comparisons with the B-factors obtained from X-ray structures are common,
although this approach has known limitations.433 It has also

been suggested422 that one could compare the nucleotideresolution flexibility obtained using ENMs to the results of selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension
(SHAPE) experiments.477 In an approach similar to ENMs, the Go̅-like model of Hori
and Takada434 incorporates structural information from atomistic simulations for parameterization of its interactions by using the procedure introduced in ref 478. It represents each nucleotide by three beads standing for sugar, phosphate group, and base. In this manner, the interactions are explicitly adjusted to reproduce the mean square fluctuations of the CG sites sampled from the atomistic simulations of a set of RNA and RNA/protein structures. Although the interactions do not correspond to an ENM, the authors use them in a similar manner for studying fluctuations and deformations of tRNAs and the ribosome. The results compare well with B-factors and substates seen in the X-ray structures.
Finally, we note the work of Benı ́tez et al.,435 who used an ENM parameterization to describe the diffusion properties of RNA structures (tRNA and rRNA). In this case, the elastic
networks were simulated using a Brownian dynamics479,480 approach that introduces hydrodynamic interactions and thus realistic solvent friction. Including only secondary structure constraints, the authors reported good agreement between the diffusion coefficients and relaxation times of the interdomain motions of the studied structures.
3.3.5. Final Considerations about Coarse-Grained Models. We have reviewed some of the most relevant CG models of RNA. Their proper use can provide useful information about thermodynamics, mechanical properties, relevant large domain motions, and possible native structures from the knowledge of the sequence and other information. They can also be employed to refine experimental data or complete missing fragments, or to explore conformational changes beyond typical all-atom MD scales, filling the gap between different time scales and experimental and computational techniques. Because they are usually parameterized with very specific tasks in mind, one should be aware of their advantages and limitations and reported results before applying them. It is important to understand which are the features that the authors have prioritized in their description according to their specific criteria. For example, when addressing thermodynamics, some authors have opted for developing rigorous expressions for the entropy of loops while treating them as structureless objects. These representations in general lack an explicit description of noncanonical base pairs and other interactions, which are critical for RNA structures (section 2). A similar issue must also be considered in the opposite way; given that knowledge-based approaches lack a rigorous interpretation of the conformational space they explore, the definition of temperature and other thermodynamic quantities is not straightforward, and could also depend on the studied structure. Simplifications of systems may lead to problems of choosing optimal sets of degrees of freedom and the possibility of overfitting the model with a reduced representation.
3.4. Interactions of RNA with Monovalent and Divalent Ions
Effects of ions on the structure and function of RNA can be profound, and accurately describing these effects is a challenging but important problem in MD simula
tions.175,177,335,481−492 Despite tremendous progress in MD
methods, there are several fundamental challenges that make it very difficult to accurately describe interactions between RNA and ions, especially divalent cations. In addition, there are a number of myths and controversies relating to the incorporation of ions into MD simulations; simulation studies have been excessively criticized over rather marginal problems, and some major uncertainties and approximations are routinely overlooked. This section therefore focuses on some of the major problems with modeling of ions in RNA MD simulations. Because of the important effects of ions on RNA structure and function, specific aspects of their modeling are also discussed in some other parts of this Review.
3.4.1. Basic Considerations about RNA−Cation Interactions. Experiments have clearly shown that cations are required to stabilize RNA structures because of RNA’s negative
charge and compactness.69,493−501 Many RNAs require divalent ions such as Mg2+ to fold properly; if only monovalent ions are present, these RNAs become only compacted. However, some RNAs can also fold correctly in the presence of excess monovalent cations. It should be noted that while diverse experimental techniques have been used to study interactions between RNA and ions, we lack detailed high-resolution data on the dynamic interactions of ions with biomolecules. Individual experimental techniques reveal only specific aspects of the ion-binding processes, and it is not straightforward to compare results obtained using different experimental methods,
or to compare experimental and computational results.502 It is widely assumed that most cations (both monovalent and divalent) interact with RNA as highly mobile species, creating a
diffusive ion atmosphere.493−496,498,502 These ions are thus expected to interact with the RNA molecule transiently, via the ion-hydration shell in the case of divalent ions. Indirect binding can be defined either on the basis of the distance between the ion and the nearest atoms of the RNA molecule, or by explicitly considering the ion’s hydration shell. If the water oxygens in the first coordination shell of an ion are not resolved in a structure obtained by X-ray crystallography, one might use the distance between the ion and the closest electronegative RNA atoms to identify an indirectly bound state. A small subset of ions can be considered structurally bound; that is, they occupy a specific binding site and typically form one or more direct interactions with the RNA molecule (Figure 23). This is known as inner-shell binding, site binding, or
chelation.69,493−496,498,502 Such interactions are characterized by the presence of an electronegative RNA atom in the ion’s first coordination shell; that is, the RNA replaces one of the water molecules normally found in a solvated ion’s inner shell. Note that monovalent ions can form inner-shell contacts that are
only transient.485,487,489,503 This is unlikely the case with divalent ions due to the slow exchange kinetics of their directly bound ligands; the energy barrier for displacing a water molecule from the first shell of Mg2+ is estimated to be around 9 kcal/mol, with microsecond-scale ligand-exchange
times.504,505 For RNA phosphates, the barrier could be even
∼12 kcal/mol.506 So, once a divalent ion binds directly to RNA, it stays bound for some time. For monovalent ions, comparison of various MD studies suggests that binding times of directly bound ions can be anywhere between transient subnanosecond
time scale and permanent binding, depending on the properties
of the ion binding sites.484,485,487,489,503,507−509
The importance of structurally bound ions is, however, sometimes overstated; it is assumed that medium-sized RNAs (i.e., RNAs with up to 100 nucleotides, or perhaps a few

hundred) only contain a few Mg2+ ions that are truly
structurally bound.69,493−496,498,502 This conclusion is primarily based on various solution-phase experiments. For example, the Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme utilizes one Mg2+ ion for
folding and another one for catalysis (see section 4.8.3.2).510,511 However, this ribozyme can fold and retains catalytic activity even in the absence of divalent ions. Moreover, experiments on Tetrahymena and Azoarcus group I intron ribozymes showed that the initial stages of their folding required only the presence of some kind of cation (even polyamines were sufficient), and
only the active site was specific for bound Mg2+ ions.69 It should be noted that unambiguous experimental counting of structurally bound divalent cations in solution is not straightforward, and the number of such cations remains a
contentious issue.502 Because of their immense size and complexity, ribosomal structures provide interesting examples of specific ion binding. For instance, the whole large ribosomal subunit (∼3000 nts)
contains approximately 120 chelated Mg2+ ions.512 However, this count is based on X-ray crystallography data, and the excessive presence of divalent ions in some X-ray structures may be responsible for the occasional overestimation of their role and number in RNA. In general, characterizing bound ions by X-ray crystallography is far from trivial due to difficulties in interpreting the associated electron density maps and the roles of the ions in crystallization, as they may be present in the crystallization media at rather high concentrations, and may
mediate crystal packing contacts (see section 3.4.6).497,513,514 Some divalent ion binding sites, for example, in some small and all large ribozymes, are considered functional (catalytic), although many small ribozymes can function even in the
absence of divalent ions.510,511,515−517 For example, hairpin
ribozyme does not utilize divalent ions for cleavage,516 and while the HDV ribozyme does probably use an Mg2+-bound
OH− group as the general base, it can also catalyze cleavage via
an Mg2+-independent pathway (see section 4.8.3.2).510,511 By contrast, self-splicing introns and RNase P directly employ two
Mg2+ ions for catalysis.483,518,519 As said before, the 2.4 Å resolution X-ray structure of the large ribosomal subunit
revealed 116 bound Mg2+ ions.512 While some binding patterns may be affected by the natural resolution limits of the ribosomal X-ray structures (see section 3.4.6), the analysis disclosed enormous variability in the specific Mg2+ binding patterns: the number of inner-sphere binding contacts between individual Mg2+ cations and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) ranged from zero to five. The Mg2+ cations help to compensate the negative charge of rRNA and can stabilize specific structures, for example, by mediating interactions between autonomously folded rRNA secondary structure elements or between rRNA and ribosomal proteins. Mg2+ ions are especially abundant around the peptidyl-transferase center, which is, in an evolutionary sense, the oldest part of the ribosome that shows a notable lack of
cationic tails of ribosomal proteins.520 Although most of the known Mg2+ binding sites revealed by X-ray structures are in large RNA structures, ion binding is also important for small RNA motifs. A textbook example is the
RNA kink-turn (see section 4.3.7),521,522 which critically requires the presence of divalent ions to fold properly in the
absence of proteins.523,524 Ions can also be involved in interesting interplays with noncanonical interactions. For example, a recurrent RNA motif bacterial 5S rRNA loop E
(LE)51,525,526 exhibits an anomalous salt dependence that complicates experimental studies of its thermodynamics. Indeed the X-ray structures of this motif revealed clear structured binding of several Mg2+ ions in its widened deep
(major) groove (see sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.4).527 LE is also associated with deep electrostatic potential (ESP) mini
ma.484−487 MD studies have suggested that two of the closely spaced Mg2+ binding sites in LE probably only bind a single ion,
with each site fractionally occupied.485,486 MD simulations also suggested that, in the absence of divalent cations, multiple
monovalent ions bind in the LE deep grooves.484−487 This and
the HIV-1 DIS kissing-loop complex (see section 4.3.10)489 provided two of the first examples of competition between divalent and monovalent ions for the same ion-binding sites documented by MD simulations. In contrast, the Sarcin-Ricin
loop (SRL, see section 4.3.6),528,529 another recurrent RNA motif with a size and base composition similar to those of LE,
essentially does not bind ions and forms only a weak ESP.530 However, the SRL motif is stabilized by several highly conserved base−phosphate interactions that are absent in
LE.50 The deep ESP valley formed along the noncanonical LE helix arises primarily from the disposition of its phosphate groups rather than the ESP of the nucleobases; in fact, the ESP of this motif is insensitive to the four G to A substitutions that distinguish bacterial and spinach chloroplast LE sequences,
which are structurally identical.484 This conservation of structure is a textbook example of the power of the isostericity principle of RNA evolution; for more details, see sections 2.2, 4.3.1, and 4.3.2. In contrast, ESP of the SRL motif is dampened because several of its phosphates form hydrogen bonds with nucleobases. This contributes to the striking difference in the
ion binding properties of LE and SRL.50

The effects of ions on RNA structure and dynamics may be affected by their concentration. The intracellular ion concentrations depend on the specific ion and cellular conditions. Usually, MD simulation protocols aim to utilize either the concentration of ions used in the experiments, to which results are compared, or some “cellular” or “physiological” concentrations. Typical physiological cellular concentrations of K+ ions
are of the order of 100 mM.531,532 The concentration of Mg2+ ions may range from millimolar to micromolar, and cells can survive at very low Mg2+ concentration if Mg2+ is replaced by
polyamines.533,534 However, one also has to take into account that conditions inside simulation solvent boxes are certainly not the same as those in the crowded molecular environments in living cells; see further comments in section 3.4.5. In summary, it is evident that the modeling of ions in MD simulations and their proper placement are critically important. However, the treatment of ions is one of Achilles heels of atomistic MD simulations of RNA. Difficulties of simulating ion binding stem from force-field approximations, insufficient sampling of ions, use of small sizes of the simulation boxes, and issues with the identification and experimental characterization of ions’ positions in RNA structures. We address each of these issues in detail below. For the sake of completeness, we note that there also exist computational approaches that can provide insights into the binding of multivalent ions to RNA
without relying on atomistic simulations.174,535,536
3.4.2. Force-Field Approximations Related to Ion Binding. The first difficulty in describing ion binding by MD stems from the approximations of the force-field model. Contemporary MD simulations use pair-additive force fields that disregard polarization effects and thus any nonadditivity of interactions (Figure 24). However, ions are charged species and
thus communicate with other molecules also via polar
ization.175,488,498,537−543 Moreover, charge-transfer effects may be important in the case of divalent cations. Note that the distinction between polarization and charge-transfer effects is somewhat arbitrary because there is no unambiguous QM
definition of these effects.537,542,544 However, in imprecise terms, polarization by a positively charged cation means that
the cation distorts the electronic density of the ligands in its coordination sphere such that an excess of negative electronic density appears on the ligand in the vicinity of the cation (Figure 25). If the polarization is strong enough, it can lead to a
donor−acceptor interaction between occupied electronic orbitals of the ligands and unoccupied orbitals of the cation, which is essentially equivalent to a ligand-to-cation charge transfer. Thus, QM-based publications usually refer to chargetransfer effects when changes in the electronic structure (i.e., the molecular orbitals) of the ligand and ion are sufficiently pronounced. Polarization and charge-transfer effects associated with ion binding are sometimes jointly referred to as
nonelectrostatic contributions,544 to separate them from simple long-range electrostatics originating from unperturbed ESPs. However, despite being quite intuitive, the term “nonelectrostatic contribution” is not rigorously defined in terms of QM theory. Polarization and charge transfer are contributions to potential energy that are not directly accounted for by pairadditive force fields because they have no corresponding forcefield terms. To explicitly account for these effects, it would be necessary to use variable electrostatic terms and parameters that respond to external electric fields. In the simplest case, the atomic charges of molecules would depend on their environment. As was already discussed in section 3.1.1.3, rearrangements of the sugar−phosphate backbone conformation could
Figure 24. Interaction energy of a trimer ΔE123 = E123 − E1 − E2 − E3
can be expressed as a sum of pairwise interaction energies ΔE12, ΔE13,
and ΔE23 plus the three-body term E3B; the latter term includes the
polarization and charge-transfer effects and is by definition 0 when using contemporary simulation force fields. GC base pair with divalent ion bound to N7 of G is shown; in this case, the E3B term brings a significant strengthening of the H-bonds. All three
participating particles electronically communicate with each other.545 E123 stands for total electronic energy of the trimer, while E1, E2, and
E3 stand for the electronic energies of the isolated monomers.118,537,545
Figure 25. Schematic representation of charge-transfer effects upon Mg2+ binding to the phosphate moiety of RNA backbone. Blue and red shadings depict the positive and negative atomic charges (or charge densities), respectively. The red, white, ochre, and black spheres are representations of the oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium atoms, respectively. The different intensity of the shadings between the four snapshots is a qualitative indication of how charges will be distributed in each scenario. With the increase of the number of ligands in the inner coordination shell of Mg2+, going from zero ligands in panel A, one in panel B, two in panel C, to six in panel D, the nominal charge of the cation is reduced. Notice that also the charge distribution of the ligands is changed upon Mg2+ binding. The phosphate oxygens donate charge to the Mg2+ ion, while the phosphorus atom itself becomes slightly more positive. The changes in the charge on the phosphate oxygens in panels B, C, and D correlate with the increase of the number of charge donors bound to the Mg2+. Note that the figure needs to be taken only as a qualitative visualization, because atomic charges are not unambiguously defined; see section 3.1.1.3.

also change the electronic structure of the RNA fragments, which is another reason why current fixed-charge models provide only a very crude approximation of real molecules. The electrostatic term should thus be also conformation-dependent. Polarizable force fields that are currently under development for nucleic acids attempt to include polarization effects using more sophisticated terms, for example, by using the formalism
of classical Drude oscillators,81−83,546,547 but it remains to be seen whether these approximations will be sufficiently robust in practical applications. In conclusion, polarization/charge-transfer effects associated with ion binding are largely orthogonal to the energy terms that are tunable with current standard forcefield formulations and parameters sets, and cannot be directly
affected by them.77,538 Consequently, the only way to mimic these effects is through effective cancellation of errors in other force-field terms. In other words, specific parameters might work correctly if used in conditions that closely match those on which their empirical fitting is based, but their transferability is limited. Cations are prominent sources of polarization and charge-transfer effects. Polarization and charge transfer lead to two salient effects
associated with ion binding.537,544,548 First, there is a polarization/charge transfer from the ion to the ligands in its first coordination shell (see Figure 25). This modulates the ligands’ electronic structures in a way that induces ligand−ligand repulsion within the inner shell, partially counteracting the potential energy gain from ligand−ion binding. Consequently, binding of water molecules to an initially “naked” ion becomes progressively less favorable: energy gain resulting from binding of the first water molecule in the inner shell is greater than that for binding the second, which is greater than that for binding the third, and so on until no further water molecules can be added to the first shell. This behavior is partly due to steric factors and unperturbed electrostatics, which are more or less well described by properly calibrated pair-additive force fields. However, some of the anticooperativity of first-shell ligand binding is due to ligand polarization: the binding-associated changes in the molecular induced dipoles within the first ligand
shell are repulsive. The second major effect of polarization/ charge transfer on ligand binding is that H-bonds between polarized water molecules (ligands) in the first coordination shell and water molecules (or other H-bond acceptors) in the second shell are much stronger than those in bulk water. Therefore, polarization creates anticooperativity in ligand-ion binding within a given shell, and cooperativity in ligand binding between consecutive ligand shells. Neither effect is explicitly accounted for in the pair-additive force-field approximation. Because the force-field parameters are set with the aim of reproducing observable physicochemical properties of ions, one might still obtain reasonable overall solvation energies, but breaking the overall interactions down into individual terms is unrealistic. In addition, it is difficult to obtain unambiguous experimental ion solvation free energies, and to compare such data to free energies computed in MD simulations on the basis of the periodic boundary condition, which complicates
parameterization efforts.549,550 Moreover, when ion-hydration free energies are used as target values for parameterization, the ion parameters necessarily become coupled to those of the
chosen water model.355,542 In addition, the ion hydration energy alone is not sufficient to unambiguously parameterize the ion potential because a given target hydration energy can be obtained using very different combinations of the two tunable Lennard-Jones parameters, which are the optimal ion−water oxygen vdW distance (minimum on the vdW potential energy curve; summed “atomic radii”) and the vdW energy (potential energy-well depth) (Figure 26). Indeed, parameter values used in different ion parameter sets reported in the literature vary widely. Unfortunately, if the ion radius lies outside a certain meaningful range, it can create problems when describing interactions with simulated biopolymers. This ambiguity is only partially removed by simultaneously targeting the equilibrium ion−water oxygen distance, because the latter parameter correlates with the hydration energy; that is, both the ion vdW radius and the energy-well depth affect the ion−water
oxygen distance.355,542 One way to alleviate this issue is to consider additional properties such as crystal lattice parameters

to narrow the parameter ranges. A further complication that must be accounted for is that the results of simulations depend not only on the values of the Lennard-Jones parameters but also on the combination rules used to calculate the vdW energies between different atoms. All of these problems can be seen as consequences of the oversimplified and unphysical
force-field description of the ions.542 Polarization effects are relatively mild (although not negligible) for monovalent ions. Alkaline earth cations such as Na+ and K+ are described reasonably well. Note that force fields are not designed to describe monovalent cations whose
binding is partially covalent, such as Ag+ or Tl+. Cl− is likely described a little less accurately than the monovalent cations because the electron clouds of anions extend further from the
nucleus, and so anions are inherently more polarizable.551 A textbook example illustrating limitations of the monovalent ion description is binding of Na+ and K+ to G-quartets in RNA
and DNA G-quadruplexes.538,552,553 Force fields qualitatively describe the basic electrostatic stabilization of the G-quadruplex stems by monovalent ions because they capture long-range electrostatics well. However, there are difficulties in describing with a force field the details of binding of desolvated ions inside the G-quadruplexes, due to profound polarization effects. A notorious problem is the occurrence of bifurcated G-quartets in
simulations of G-quadruplexes.128,554 Comparisons with benchmark QM calculations further revealed that force field underestimated the direct interaction energy between the ion
and G-quartets;552 for an explanation of the term “interaction energy”, see ref 118. In addition, the ions inside the Gquadruplex often behave as having excessively large atomic radii; that is, they fluctuate as though they do not fit properly in the cavity. This is because it is difficult to simultaneously fully balance all of the relevant energy contributions; this particular problem might arise from a parameterization mismatch between ion hydration energies and ion−quartet interactions. Full extent of the force fields’ limitations in this case was demonstrated by a benchmark QM study that scrutinized binding of multiple monovalent ions inside G-quadruplex
stems.538,553 When two or more ions are present inside the stem, their effective mutual repulsion is significantly overestimated by force fields (Figure 27). Real ions communicate with each other electronically through polarization of the Gquartets in the stem. This typically softens their mutual electrostatic repulsion relatively to that present between two +1 point charges. To correctly describe the ion−ion interaction inside the G-stem, it would be needed to somehow reduce the
ion charges.538 However, this would have to be done in a geometry-dependent manner. The charge distributions of both the cations and the G-quartets would have to be recalculated
for each snapshot realized in the simulation, rendering the fixed-charge force-field approximation inadequate. In reality, any change in the coordinates of the ions or the quartet geometries will modify the system’s electronic structure. Effects of polarization and charge transfer on the binding and modeling of divalent ions are far greater than for monovalent ions, so the failure of force fields to adequately describe these effects can severely affect the quality of modeling of divalent ions. Therefore, while publications on MD simulation studies often state that the simulations were performed “in the presence of Mg2+”, such claims should be treated with care, because force-field descriptions of divalent ions are well outside the limits of approximations of contemporary multipurpose biomolecular force fields. They involve far more severe approximations than are used to describe the organic components of the RNA molecule or the monovalent ions. Total contribution of nonadditive effects in the first ligand shell of Mg2+ amounts to ∼70 kcal/mol in absolute terms, which is
equivalent to the interaction potential energy of five AU base
pairs.537,545
Fortunately, there are large mutual error compensations between the different missing energy terms. For example, the absence of polarization means that force fields underestimate both direct ion−ligand attraction and interligand repulsion. This attenuates the error in description of the difference between hexa-hydrated Mg2+ and partially dehydrated Mg2+ coordinated with RNA. However, the main problem is that even if a force field can be adjusted to reproduce one target property of a system (for example, the hydration energy), it is still very difficult to simultaneously obtain a correct description
of its full range of interactions.542 One should thus be careful when choosing ion parameters, and perform simulations using parameters designed to reproduce physical properties most important for the problem at hand. For example, one might be interested in the effect of Mg2+ on an RNA structure in which direct binding might not be relevant. In such cases, a force field that accurately reproduces the behavior of hexahydrated Mg2+ would suffice. It is difficult to quantitatively estimate the magnitude of errors, or which phenomena one might be missing when using a given force field to simulate the binding dynamics of Mg2+. The only benchmark method that would provide a true picture of ion binding would be a sufficiently long QM dynamics simulation using a sufficiently accurate QM description. Such calculations are far beyond the capabilities of modern hardware. However, simpler QM studies (involving gradient optimizations and energy calculations on small molecular clusters) have yielded results that differ markedly from equivalent force field
based predictions.537,540,544 For example, the physical proper

ties of water molecules in the first ligand shell of Mg2+ are very different from those of bulk water: the ion-bound waters can form much stronger H-bonds, which can be inferred from the large stretch (elongation) of the Ow−H covalent bond.537 Binding of divalent ions to the guanine N7 may also affect the strength of its base pairing via guanine polarization (Figure
24).539,545,555−558 There is an intricate network of polarization/ charge-transfer effects in the vicinity of any divalent ion bound to RNA that is specifically modulated by the type of the divalent ion and the structure of the binding site.488,537,544 However, it is important to note that most reported QM results relate to gas-phase clusters or clusters surrounded by a
continuum solvent, which may somewhat overemphasize the role of polarization/charge-transfer effects. These calculations reveal the upper limit of these effects as compared to fully solvated systems. QM calculations of hydrated Mg2+ ions interacting with different RNA binding sites clearly demonstrated the magnitude of the complex charge-transfer and polarization effects in these systems using Natural Bond Orbital and Bader analyses (Figure 28).488 Nevertheless, the authors suggested that the differences in charge transfer and polarization among common Mg2+−RNA coordination patterns are surprisingly small. In particular, charge of the Mg2+ ion does not vary greatly

between coordination sites, suggesting that approaches based on developing site-specific Mg2+ ion parameters (with different vdW parameters for different RNA binding patterns) may not be consistent with the physical origin of the inaccuracies in the MM description of Mg2+−RNA interactions in the MD simulations. However, the results in no way say that the MM description of Mg2+ is satisfactory. For example, the authors reported highly variable levels of charge-transfer involving the
first-shell water molecules.488 More specifically, the charge rearrangement of the water hydrogen atoms decreased markedly when RNA atom ligands were included in the coordination sphere. Consequently, the physical properties of the bound water molecules depended on the nature of the cation’s other ligands (for discussions of a similar effect, see ref 544). QM calculations also clearly confirmed the existence of sizable charge-transfer/polarization effects between the first and second ligand shells of Mg2+. To complement the QM calculations, the authors presented a comparative analysis of five Mg2+ parameterizations based on MD simulations of the
Group IIC intron and HDV ribozyme.488 The severity of the pair-additive approximation is clearly illustrated also by the difference between Mg2+ and Zn2+. Both ions have identical charges and very similar radii, so their simplest force-field models are inevitably similar. In reality, Mg2+ and Zn2+ are quite different ions due to factors such as the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of Zn2+. While Mg2+ is almost always hexa-coordinated, Zn2+ can have anywhere
between four and six ligands.548 Moreover, Mg2+ preferentially interacts with oxygen atoms, whereas Zn2+ prefers nitrogen atoms such as the N7 centers of purine bases due to its ability to accept electron density from nitrogen lone pairs (which are delocalized in the case of nucleobases) into its vacant orbitals. This is a clear example of a charge-transfer interaction. All of these effects are missing in the force-field description, so the differences between Zn2+ and Mg2+ can only be captured by QM calculations or by using specialized force fields with charge-transfer terms such as Sum of Interactions Between
Fragments Ab initio computed (SIBFA).540,541 However, these methods are not yet suitable for MD simulations of biomolecules. We suggest that polarization/charge-transfer effects associated with divalent ions are so severe that they may not be adequately described using the formalism of the multipurpose polarizable biomolecular force fields currently in develop
ment559 without significantly compromising their portability. Unlike SIBFA, these polarizable force fields seem to lack terms suitable for explicitly describing charge-transfer effects. Going back to the simplest force fields, the only way to respect the existence of these effects in a pairwise additive force field is to optimize the few available parameters to obtain the correct overall behavior. However, any such optimization will inevitably have limited transferability. There are ongoing attempts to improve the description of ions by adding additional ad hoc terms to the usual pointcharge plus vdW Lennard-Jones 12-6 description, as reviewed
by Li and Merz.542 For instance, 12-6-4 vdW terms have been suggested to improve the behavior of Mg2+ in simula
tions.560,561 A physical reason for including the r−4 term in the parameterization is that it offers a way to mimic charge− induced dipole and dipole−induced dipole energy terms. An
attempt to further tune the r−4 terms (the C4 parameters) for RNA has been reported, targeting the balance between binding
to phosphates and to N7 atoms of purine nucleobases.562
Completely different models have also been proposed, in which the Mg2+ ion is modeled as a rigid body that includes displaced charges (using dummy atoms) to mimic the electronic structure
around the ion.563−565 However, none of these models directly includes polarization and charge-transfer effects. Essentially, one has just two (or a few when using more sophisticated potentials) parameters available for tuning: the atomic radii and the depth of the vdW potential well. Moreover, as noted above,
these two parameters are interrelated to a certain extent.355,542 Thus, the common practice of training the ion parameters to reproduce hydration energies could create flaws in the description of direct solute−ion interactions, and vice versa. An interesting alternative attempt to obtain ion parameters has been parameterization of Mg2+, Li+, Na+, and K+ Lennard-Jones
potentials using experimental osmotic coefficients.566,567 Some early MD simulations of nucleic acids suffered from another specific problem that may be indirectly related to the simplicity of the force field. When excess salt (NaCl or KCl) was added to the net-neutralizing ion atmosphere, spurious cation−anion pairing, clustering, and even crystallization occurred when the simulated system was well below the
solubility limits of the real system.481,568 This problem has been severe for some older parameterizations (or combinations of parameters) of the ions, including at that time standard combination of parameters and combination rules in the AMBER code. This could have affected some older simulations when the authors did not notice the problem. The salt crystallization effect has been eliminated or at least efficiently
suppressed by newer parameterizations.355
3.4.3. Difficulties in Sampling Ions. A second source of difficulties in properly describing ions is sampling. For monovalent ions, good and almost converged sampling of the
simulation box can be achieved on a time scale of 100 ns.569,570 Exceptions include tightly bound ions and especially poorly accessible ion-binding inner pockets that do not easily exchange with the bulk solvent. Conversely, easily accessible monovalent ion binding sites are usually swiftly found by the ions in the course of the simulations. Two examples that illustrate the diversity of ions’ kinetic behavior in MD simulations are the open monovalent ion binding site in the catalytic pocket of
HDV ribozyme503 and the buried ion binding site at the quadruplex-duplex junction of the fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP) RGG peptide−RNA complex;154,508 see sections 4.8.3.2 and 4.7.10. Sampling of hexahydrated Mg2+ ions that bind via outer-shell (through-water) interactions can be quite tricky. If simulations are performed using typical experimental ion concentrations, the number of included divalent ions will be rather small, requiring more simulation time to converge the exploration of all possible binding sites. A different approach should be adopted if one is interested in modeling the direct binding of Mg2+ to RNA, which is a completely different story in terms of sampling. Modeling could be straightforward if the exact position and coordination of the bound ion are known from experiments. However, spontaneously sampling first-shell ligand exchanges for Mg2+ is a complex problem. Experiments suggest that the water molecules from the first shell of the Mg2+
exchange on a microsecond time scale.505 Suitable methods should thus be used to explore all of the putative binding
sites.335,571 Sample results obtained with enhanced sampling techniques are reported in Figure 17. In addition, the force fields may not be sufficiently accurate to properly capture the kinetics and thermodynamics of such events (section 3.4.2).

Thus, in earlier simulations with the at the time popular
Aqvist’s Mg2+ parameters,572 the formation of spurious innershell (direct) binding to the RNA atoms has been often
observed even during equilibration.131 This problem might have been eliminated by newer parameterizations, in which Mg2+ is practically maintained hexahydrate by increasing the
dehydration free-energy barrier.504 Such parameterization should improve kinetic properties of the cation ligand shell, albeit possibly at the expense of accurately modeling the ion’s thermodynamics properties. Such parameterizations may run into troubles when simulating real cases of inner-shell Mg2+ binding, for example, in the ligand binding pocket of the
quaternary HutP protein/RNA complex.573 Here, the experimentally observed Mg2+−nitrogen atom interactions are irreversibly lost on a time scale of few hundreds nanoseconds
with the Allner et al. parameters,504 while the Aqvist’s
parameters,572 due to their specific compensation of errors, neatly keep the experimentally observed ligand binding shell
unperturbed in multiple microsecond time scale simulations.110 Interestingly, when testing the consensus 12-6 parameters by Li
and Merz,574 the authors have obtained a quite stable HutP
ligand binding pocket with SPC/E575 but not with TIP3P576
water model.110 This is a reminder of the complex dependence of the ion binding processes at different binding sites on ion as well as water model parameters. This is why numerous parameterizations of ions for biomolecular simulations can be
found in the literature.355,542,561,574,577,578 However, as noted above, all of them suffer from the common limitations of pair additive force fields, irrespective of which property is used as the target in the parameterization. It is inevitable that improving one target property may worsen others; tweaking parameters cannot fully compensate for the inadequacy of the underlying physics.
3.4.4. Importance of the Simulation Box Size. A third problem in ion treatment relates to the second. Proper sampling of ions in solution requires appropriately sized boxes. Most published simulations have used relatively small solvent boxes; the typical recommended distance between the solute and the edge of the water box is 10−15 Å, and simulations are usually performed using periodic boundary conditions and the
particle-mesh Ewald (PME) formalism.579 Small boxes prevent the ion distribution at the box border from matching that in bulk solvent, so the simulations may suffer from finite-size
artifacts (Figure 29).580,581 Large boxes can be used but significantly increase computational costs, effectively reducing the amount of simulation time and thus the sampling of the
system.582,583
When an ion leaves the box, it does not enter the bulk solvent but instead enters the box on the opposite side. Thus, even if ion binding sites around the solute are well sampled (within the force-field limitations), the exchange between different binding sites may be affected by a small box size. A box that is too small cannot provide a realistic partitioning between local and bulk ions because it is lacking a true bulk. These effects are discussed extensively in refs 580 and 581. In real systems, the presence of the highly charged RNA macro-anion causes counterion accumulation and co-ion depletion in the RNA local atmosphere, so the RNA charge is completely
neutralized by the ion atmosphere.496,502 However, the typically used box sizes cause spurious truncation of the ionic atmosphere around the simulated RNA. This, when performing excess-salt simulations, leads to an unrealistic accumulation of
anionic species near the edges of the box.580,581 A similar effect
was also observed in ref 335, where the computed affinity between Mg2+ and RNA displayed a dependence on box size consistent with this trend. In addition to this, the limited amount of space available in a small simulation box might prevent the system from properly equilibrating on the simulation times-scale; that is, one can expect that the
equilibration of the ion distribution is slowed.580,581 Moreover, because the equilibrium of the ion distribution is substantially affected, also the kinetics of ion diffusion processes is inevitably distorted, even in simulations that reach equilibrium. Simulations with standard boxes thus should not be used to make quantitative suggestions about the nature of ion diffusion
processes around the RNA molecule. One MD study367 correctly reproduced the different free-energy effect of guanine
to inosine substitution in A-RNA and B-DNA584 using the TI method (see sections 3.2.7 and 4.3.3). However, the saltdependence of this phenomenon could not be correctly
reproduced.367 This may have been due to the use of an insufficiently large box. The consequences of a small simulation box are thus certainly significant but have yet to be fully quantified. Some authors also argued that there could be errors
stemming from the PME method,585 although, again, these have not been clearly documented yet. Many past nucleic acid simulations were performed using a net-neutral cation atmosphere, which was usually achieved by adding Na+. While this approach is widely accepted by most in the simulation community, it has been occasionally questioned

because it does not correspond to experimental salt conditions. However, while net neutral conditions may look non-natural at first glance, they can be justified and should not cause major problems, at least in comparison to those arising from other approximations. Because RNA has a charge of −1 per phosphate, net-neutralization (one monovalent cation per phosphate) with commonly used solvent boxes corresponds to fairly relevant cation concentrations of ∼0.2−0.3 M. This estimate is obviously not valid for net-neutralization of protein−RNA complexes if the bound protein provides substantial compensation for the net charge of the RNA. The cation concentration can be calculated by simply comparing the number of ions to the number of waters in the simulation box. Adding excess salt would further increase the cation concentration. For completeness, it should be noted that the formal solute concentration in simulations is relatively large (a concentration of 0.01 M for the solute corresponds to ∼5500 water molecules), but solute−solute contacts are prevented by the use of sufficiently large boxes in connection with periodic boundary condition.
3.4.5. Should Ion Conditions in Simulations Match Those in Experiments? Some in the research community have suggested that simulations should exactly mimic the ion conditions of experiments, arguing that certain calculations are flawed because the authors used Na+ instead of K+, or vice versa, or did not use excess salt, or did not use divalent ions, etc. Below we explain why such criticisms are usually excessive. There are several reasons for not requiring the salt conditions in MD simulations to exactly match those of specific experiments. First, it is, in fact, not possible. There are unavoidable intrinsic differences between MD and experiments that should be taken into account. For example, the infinite solvent is mimicked by the periodic boundary condition approximation, and the box size is always much smaller than any experimental buffer. This factor alone means that the conditions in which the MD simulation and experiment are performed can hardly be entirely equivalent. Second, biological relevance of salt conditions used in some experiments can be questionable, for instance, in crystallization experiments (see section 3.4.6). There are indeed works in which the concentration of ions is exaggerated with respect to the intracellular one to help crystallization or to make sure that the folded RNA structure is kept intact throughout the experiment. RNA folding is usually accelerated at higher Mg2+ concentration. Nonetheless, there are counterexamples in which the increase of ion concentration does not accelerate folding but
instead creates kinetic traps or induces misfolding.586 Most importantly, MD simulations are frequently performed to investigate properties of the molecules that may be largely insensitive to small changes in the salt conditions if one accounts for the starting structure and simulation time. MD simulations are relatively short and typically stay within one conformational substate, so they are probably less sensitive to ion treatment than real nucleic acids in folding experiments. The ion-dependence of the simulations should therefore not be compared to known equilibrium experimental thermodynamics salt dependences or experimental conditions with excessive strictness. Experimental results reflect equilibrium thermodynamics, whereas simulations usually sample around the starting structure. Therefore, if the experimental ion-dependence correlates with the relative stability of two ensembles (substates) that are not simultaneously sampled in the simulation, the simulation’s behavior may be fairly insensitive
to the type and concentration of the ions used. For example, at equilibrium, an RNA kink-turn should unfold in the absence of
proteins and divalent ions.523,524 However, when one extracts the structure of the folded kink-turn from the ribosome, the kink-turn can be simulated in its folded (kinked) conformation in the presence of only a net-neutralizing cation atmosphere
(see section 4.3.7).522 Such simulations are entirely relevant when studying the effects of base substitutions, internal flexibility of the kink-turn in its folded states, molecular contacts at the protein/RNA interfaces, and many other properties of the folded kink-turn. The transition to the unkinked ensemble is not observable on the usual simulation time scales due to the presence of a high kinetic barrier. Such simulations thus cannot reproduce and are not sensitive to any phenomena that result from communication between the folded and unfolded ensembles. Another textbook example of the lack of any profound ion identity effect on MD is the
simulation of G-quadruplexes.170 G-quadruplexes are prominent monovalent ion binders, and changing the ions can affect the population of their different folds in thermodynamics equilibrium in experiments. Despite this, one can safely simulate any folded G-quadruplex using either Na+ or K+, without noticing any systematic differences. This is thanks to the fact that the lifetime (i.e., the reciprocal of the koff rate constant) of a folded quadruplex (i.e., a single molecule) is typically on the order of minutes in real time no matter what cations are present. These time scales are orders of magnitude beyond those accessible in simulations with modern hardware. Therefore, while swapping from Na+ to K+ may have subtle effects on ion dynamics in simulations of specific single folds (conformations), these effects are usually inseparable from the sampling uncertainties. Furthermore, the effects of different ions on the relative stability of different folds are not sensed by the simulations. All known G-quadruplexes simulated with ions in their channel retain their starting fold independently of the
ionic conditions, as discussed at length elsewhere.128,170,587 A rather unexplored topic and a potential source of errors is that virtually all MD simulations are performed at a fixed number of atoms. Thus, the most reliable way to know the effective ionic concentration that is comparable to experiments is to measure the ion−water ratio (concentration) as far as possible from the solute. Because the number of ions is fixed, the concentration of ions in the bulk could change if the solute undergoes a conformational change that affects the number of trapped ions. Ideally, this number should not be dependent on the specific conformation of the solute. In cases where this number depends on the solute conformation, one should use methods that keep a constant chemical potential of the ions instead of a constant number of ions. Simulating such ensembles is nontrivial, and has proven to be challenging both theoretically and in terms of practical implementation. A suitable approach to this problem has been proposed, but to
date it has only been applied to urea, which is not charged.588 3.4.6. Problems with Experimental Positions of Ions. Another fundamental issue is uncertainty in experimental structural data. This is an absolutely critical problem when dealing with directly bound divalent ions because their incorrect placement at the start of an MD simulation may cause serious sampling problems. Indeed, due to the problems discussed above, incorrectly placed divalent ions may both stay trapped in the same place for the entire simulation and also trap the RNA structure in an incorrect conformation. NMR studies usually do not detect positions of ions around nucleic acids, or

only provide indirect information on their positions.589−591 In principle, X-ray structures could provide reliable information on the binding patterns of Mg2+ ions. However, the relevance and accuracy of their structural information is sometimes compromised. First, some ions observed in X-ray structures may be present because they played some role in the formation of the crystal lattice, and may not interact in the same place in solution. Second, some centers identified as Mg2+ cations
during refinement may actually be other particles.513,592
In an earlier MD study on the product593 and inactivated
precursor594 of the HDV ribozyme,503 a striking difference between the two experimental structures was noticed. The precursor X-ray structure featured only two bound Mg2+ ions, both neatly placed in dominant ESP minima identified in the simulations. Both ions behaved well when included in MD simulations. However, the product X-ray structure included nine bound Mg2+ cations, some of which were not close to any ESP minima. It is likely that some of these ions were not properly refined. A systematic analysis revealed that it is not uncommon for electron densities corresponding to water molecules or monovalent ions to be identified as Mg2+ ions
during refinement.592,595 Even more strikingly, some reported Mg2+ ions may correspond to misinterpreted anion den
sities.592,595 Even though one might expect that these incorrectly placed ions would quickly dissociate in simulations using a well-parameterized force field, transferring such unnatural Mg2+ ions into simulations may cause substantial instability because the incorrectly bound divalent cation could immediately perturb the RNA structure. A unique insight into the ambiguities of identifying cation binding in RNA X-ray studies was obtained in a benchmark study using X-ray structures of the duplex of the HIV-1 dimerization initiation site (DIS), which contains a known ion
binding internal loop.596 The X-ray structures were solved in the presence of 13 different cations: K+, Pb2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Au3+, Pt4+, [Co(NH3)6]3+, and [Ru
(NH3)6]3+. This RNA molecule exhibits sequence symmetry but lacks true crystallographic symmetry, so each structure provided two crystallographically independent but equivalent ion-binding patterns. The study revealed very diverse ionbinding patterns that were often not very consistent with the commonly assumed basic rules governing the binding properties of different ions. More strikingly, in many instances the binding of a given cation to the two presumably equivalent halves of the duplex was very different. The authors suggested a complex and strong dependence of the observed cation binding on hidden parameters that could be related to biochemically
irrelevant differences in crystal packing.596 Binding of Mg2+ to the pocket of HIV-1 DIS kissing-loop complexes provides another illustration of the difficulty of identifying cation binding to RNA by X-ray crystallography. Some X-ray structures clearly show the binding of an Mg2+ ion to the pocket, while other crystal structures do not identify
bound ions in the same position.597,598 It has been shown by atomistic MD simulations that, in the absence of divalent ions, the pocket of HIV-1 DIS kissing-loop complexes is occupied by a set of 2−3 long-residency but delocalized monovalent ions
(see section 4.3.10).489 The X-ray structures have also revealed that the Mg2+ ions in the kissing-loop complex may be
displaced by a spermine molecule used for the crystallization;598 note that positions of spermine molecules are rarely identified in X-ray structures. Simulations of many other RNA systems have similarly shown that monovalent ions can occupy the
same ion binding sites as divalent ions. These observations confirm the complexity of ion-binding to RNA, which involves both competition among different types of bound ions and that among different ion-binding patterns. Consequently, one X-ray structure of a given molecule may suggest the presence of an important divalent ion binding site, while another structure of the same molecule may show no ion binding because the site is, for example, interacting with fluctuating monovalent ions that cannot be discerned from the densities. In the case of the HDV ribozyme, the MD prediction of a monovalent ion binding site
at the catalytic pocket503 was subsequently confirmed by an X
ray structure obtained in the presence of Tl+.599 The absence of bound ions in some X-ray structures of the HIV-1 DIS kissingloop complexes is readily explained by the presence of fluctuating monovalent ions or spermine that are not experimentally resolvable because of averaging. Even dynamic fluctuations of divalent ions can prevent their detection in many refined X-ray structures. Thus, while some X-ray structures may feature incorrectly refined ions or ions whose presence is due to crystal packing, others may fail to resolve important bound
ions. As concluded by Ennifar et al.,596 it is inadvisable to draw firm conclusions on the mode of binding of a given cation on the basis of a single crystallographic example. This is obviously a substantial problem when preparing starting structures for MD simulations, where one must rely on single crystallographic structures. With regards to incorrectly assigned Mg2+ ions, newer
studies514,600 suggest that at least for high-resolution crystallographic structures one can reliably determine that a resolved species that may be an ion is not an Mg2+ center by applying a set of distance constraints derived from the known chemical behavior of Mg2+. However, a much more careful analysis would be needed to identify a directly bound Mg2+ without any uncertainty. This would require consideration of geometric constraints on the first coordination shell of magnesium and typical distances from its most common ligands (phosphate
oxygens and guanine O6 oxygens).513,514 It should be noted that, at first sight, MD simulations would be ideal tools for studying the structural dynamics of the diffusive ion atmosphere around RNA molecules and the coupling of ion atmosphere dynamics with solute structural dynamics and transitions. There are currently no experimental methods that permit quantitative characterization of the ion
atmosphere.601 As noted above, the presence of an RNA polynucleotide causes compensatory ion redistribution, which can be characterized, for example, by measuring preferential ion interaction coefficients that reflect the cation accumulation and anion depletion around the RNA (resulting in a positive excess
of cations and negative excess of anions).496,502,601 However, this information alone is not sufficient to characterize the ion atmosphere because the overall preferential ion interaction coefficients are entirely insufficient to quantify the ion distributions reflected by radial distribution functions, never mind ion dynamics. Thus, in principle, MD simulations provide an ideal method for capturing the structural and dynamic details of the diffusive ion atmosphere. However, because of the limits discussed above, MD data must be interpreted with great care. Comparison of cation accumulation and radial ion distribution patterns obtained for B-DNA duplex using atomistic MD simulations and the 3D-RISM (3D reference interaction site model) formalism showed that while both methods gave similar preferential ion interaction coefficients,

they predicted different spatial distributions of ions around the
solute molecule.602
3.4.7. How to Choose the Ionic Conditions for a Simulation? Given the above limitations, it is actually quite reasonable to perform MD simulations of RNA molecules without including divalent cations except in cases where there is unambiguous and exact structural information about a specifically bound Mg2+. In the absence of such information, including divalents may lead to more losses than gains because incorrectly bound divalent cations can severely distort the simulated structure in a way that is not reparable on moderate simulation time scales. Divalent ions also complicate sampling. Regarding the issue of the sensitivity of the simulations to the different monovalent ion treatments (i.e., Na+ vs K+ and netneutral vs excess-salt simulation conditions), several studies explicitly testing diverse ion conditions have been reported, and it was found that the simulations (with presently achievable time scales and box sizes) are fairly insensitive to the type and
concentration of monovalent ions.137,422,603−605 In fact, the results were often more sensitive to the use of specific water
models.137,604,605 At first sight, ions might seem to be more important components of simulation boxes than water molecules. However, the number of water molecules interacting with the RNA at any instant is much larger than the number of ions, explaining the simulations’ sensitivity to the water model’s parameterization. This point in no way excludes the possibility that simulations of some systems may be highly dependent on
the type and concentration of monovalent cations.128 If one accounts for all of the limitations discussed above, Mg2+ ions can be usefully incorporated in MD simulations. Some newer Mg2+ models focus on describing specific types of
interactions. For example, the model of Allnér et al.504 was developed to better describe the interactions between Mg2+ and the nonbridging oxygens in the RNA backbone, together with the ion−water exchange rate. However, while properties like hydration free energies, ion−water coordination numbers, and oxygen distances are correlated, given the discussed limitations it might be not possible for a single set of LJ parameters to accurately depict all of these properties simultane
ously.110,542,574,578 Introducing extra LJ terms (12-6-4) or distributing the charge over dummy atoms (multisite ion models) does not always yield a better model for an arbitrary property because the model’s quality is conditioned to the quantities it was designed to match. Furthermore, when a new model is proposed, a certain amount of time is needed for both proper testing and design improvements. Consequently, newer models may be less accurate than older ones when tested against large numbers of benchmarks or for specific goals (see section 3.4.3). York et al. compared the thermodynamic, kinetic, structural, and mass transport properties of 17 available Mg2+ MD models and found that, while many models accurately reproduced specific properties, only one 12-6-4 LJ model, coupled with a specific water model (SPC/E), managed
to reproduce all of the studied properties reasonably well.578 3.4.8. Selected Simulation Studies Investigating the Ion-Binding to RNA. The paragraphs above discuss selected studies on the interactions of RNA with ions. However, there are numerous other studies in this area that warrant discussion (some of which are covered in other parts of this Review). For example, MD was used to investigate the structural roles of both mono- and divalent cations in the Varkud satellite
ribozyme stem-loop V (SLV).490,491,606 The SLV is an interesting RNA system because its structure and dynamics
are Mg2+ dependent, and both Mg-free and Mg-bound structures are known.607 The simulations revealed that the Mg-free SLV structure exhibited a partial transition into a structure resembling the Mg-bound state upon binding of K+, but the correct Mg-bound structure was established only in the presence of Mg2+. While one would not expect Mg2+ to reversibly sample every possible binding site on the studied time scale, it was interesting to see that adding Mg2+ in the simulation led to formation of the experimentally observed structure. The authors also reported a systematic analysis of different modern Mg2+ force-field models. While the relative binding patterns and occupancies were model-dependent, all of the models led to formation of the correct Mg-bound SLV structure. Surprisingly, the 12-6-4 model, which was expected to be the most accurate, was the poorest at capturing the occupancy of the directly bound Mg2+ ions.490 This reemphasizes the warning that the supposedly best models are conditioned to specific properties, and that the problem of selecting the best model from the available options is nontrivial, and possibly not even well-defined. The inclusion of divalent ions in RNA simulations will likely remain a tricky problem with no flawless solution. MD simulations were also used to investigate the ion dependence of unfolding of GTPase associated center rRNA.608,609 Another work used atomistic MD to show that multivalent counterions increase bending rigidity (i.e., the persistence length) of double-stranded RNA by at least 30%, which contradicts the data for DNA.610 This counterintuitive effect is observed for various tri- and tetravalent ions, and is robust to methodological details and changes in the RNA sequence. The simulations suggested that, in contrast to B-DNA, multivalent counterions bind inside the A-RNA major groove, causing significant contraction of the molecule along its helical axis. This makes further deformation due to bending more energetically expensive than it would be in the absence of the bound multivalent ions (for further discussion of differences between A-RNA and B-DNA helices, see section 4.3.9). Finally, it should be noted that modeling of transition metal cations is even more complicated than modeling Mg2+.542 While ions are mostly described via nonbonded (intermolecular) force-field models in RNA simulations, modeling of transition metal centers may often benefit from the use of a bonded particle approach that is specifically parameterized for a certain coordination number and chemical environment. While the parameterization of multipurpose potentials is difficult for organic compounds, it is virtually insoluble for transition metal elements. Transition metals use higher-angular momentum orbitals (d and f) to establish complex chemical bonding patterns, may exist in different oxidation states, and can adopt a range of different coordination symmetries. In many cases, various spin states of the transition metal systems may be close in energy, complicating the calculations or even leading to problems due to real degeneracy of the electronic states. As a result, it is difficult to obtain quantitatively accurate descriptions of many transition metal elements in certain open-shell electronic states even when using the best available QM
based approaches.611−613 However, this topic is beyond the scope of this Review.

4. MD SIMULATIONS OF SPECIFIC RNA SYSTEMS
4.1. RNA Tetranucleotides as Key Benchmarks for Force Fields and Enhanced Sampling Methods
The smallest model systems studied widely are tetranucleotides. Although they do not have any particular biological function, the structural dynamics of single-stranded RNA is of relevance for understanding RNA folding processes and for description of unstructured RNAs. In addition, some folded RNAs contain single-stranded segments. Further, tetranucleotides have become key benchmarks for RNA force fields, because unique
NMR data for several sequences are available.614−616 Distances obtained from transient nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) experiments are particularly important because they directly report on the proton−proton contacts present in solution, together with boundaries of their populations. In these experiments, all of the observed signals have similar line widths,
and only nonexchangeable protons are analyzed.222 Furthermore, these experiments reveal which contacts are absent in solution and should thus not be observed in MD simulations. In other words, they provide both positive and negative information that can be used to characterize the structural
ensemble.617 The NMR data indicate that RNA tetranucleo
tides mostly adopt an A-form-like conformation in solution,616
with the exception of the disordered r(UUUU).616 Importantly,
so-called intercalated structures with out-of-order stacking are either absent or only populated at a level below the limit of detection. However, intercalated structures are highly populated in MD simulations and thus appear to be force-field artifacts (Figure 30). According to the NMR data, tetranucleotides composed of
purines (e.g., r(AAAA)) mostly sample the A-helix form.616 As such, it makes sense to compare the MD-sampled structures to a single reference structure. In contrast, tetranucleotides composed of pyrimidines (e.g., r(UUUU)) are highly flexible, and even solution-phase experiments suggest the coexistence of
several different structures.616 As such, any comparison of simulated and experimental results should preferably use primary solution-phase NMR data. Every tetranucleotide that has been studied by NMR has exhibited anti glycosidic torsions and 3′-endo puckered sugars, with the exception of the 3′ terminal ribose in r(UUUU). The structural dynamics of RNA tetranucleotides is highly sensitive to stacking interactions, backbone conformations, base−phosphate, and ribose−phosphate hydrogen bonds. The quality of force fields’ descriptions of these energy contributions can thus be assessed by studying these systems. Conversely, although base pairing interactions play central roles in determining structures and dynamics of larger RNA molecules, they are not present in these short oligomers, so

studies on tetranucleotides cannot provide much information on force-field descriptions of base pairing. Tetranucleotides are therefore important model systems for selectively probing performance of the force field for a subset of factors determining the RNA structure. However, they should not be used as the sole benchmarks for force-field tuning because doing so could lead to overfitting. The initial insights into the difficulties of simulating RNA tetranucleotides with the available force fields emerged from simulations that accompanied the original NMR studies and were already complemented by some attempts to improve the
force fields. For the r(GACC),614 a spurious population of the syn conformation of the glycosidic bonds was observed in MD simulations using the at the time standard ff99 force field (see section 3.1.2). A previously reported refinement of the glycosidic torsion potential χYIL
136 yielded better agreement with the NMR data (see section 3.1.2.2). A later work
presented NMR data for the r(CCCC)615 and compared them to the results of simulations using a different force-field
reparameterization, AMBER99TOR (see section 3.1.2.2).138 A
subsequent comprehensive work616 compared reference NMR data for the r(AAAA), r(CAAU), r(GACC), and r(UUUU) to the results of MD simulations. While the reported simulations were too short to permit ergodic sampling, these three seminal
papers614−616 provided very important reference experimental data and introduced the idea of benchmarking MD ensembles against solution-phase experiments. Importantly, the MD results were compared to primary NMR observables rather than to a single structure deduced from a model. Ultimately, the authors found that all of the tested force fields predicted significant populations of structures that were incompatible with the NMR data, including the aforementioned spurious
intercalated structures.614−616 Tetranucleotides are also challenging from the point of view of sampling. Despite their small size, it is difficult to achieve their ergodic, statistically converged sampling. This would require extremely long MD simulations with time scales of at least hundreds of microseconds. Therefore, RNA tetranucleotides are also good benchmarks for assessment of the performance of enhanced sampling techniques (see section 3.2). In particular, the r(GACC) has been used as a test system in several methodological papers examining techniques
including T-REMD, reservoir T-REMD,258 multidimensional
REMD,271 accelerated MD coupled with T-REMD,269 and replica exchange with collective-variable tempering (see
sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.6).259 These studies were primarily intended to benchmark the chosen enhanced sampling methods. However, they all predicted large populations of the intercalated structures and other spurious conformations, fully confirming the Turner group’s results from medium-length
plain MD simulations.616 A subsequent study presented probably the most extensive enhanced sampling simulations of RNA tetranucleotides
reported to date,139 likely achieving for the first time statistically converged results. The study clearly revealed that none of the presently available force fields could produce conformational ensembles for r(GACC) and r(CCCC) that are consistent with the available solution-phase experimental data. Another work
from the same group126 showed that an improved OPC water
model127 and modified phosphate vdW parameters150 somewhat reduced the population of the intercalated structures. In both studies, comparison between MD and NMR was done
mainly by monitoring the population of A-helix-like structures rather than using primary experimental data (Figure 31).
Subsequently, Bottaro et al. reported T-REMD simulations of five tetranucleotides for which experimental data were
available.242 They confirmed disagreement between MD and NMR by comparing the simulations’ results to primary NMR data, including both NOEs to probe intercalated structures and scalar couplings to probe backbone conformations. Although these simulations were shorter than those reported by
Cheatham et al.,139 they achieved significantly more robust sampling than those reported in the original works by the
Turner group,616 with relatively low statistical errors. Interestingly, the study demonstrated that ensembles of tetranucleotide fragments with a given sequence extracted from the NDB/PDB database of RNA crystallographic structures agreed more closely with primary NMR data than did ensembles generated using MD. Similar observations have
been made for protein systems.618 This prompted an attempt to test empirical corrections that enforce dihedral distributions
obtained from the PDB database.143 The idea of using rotamer distributions from the PDB database to refine a force field has been adopted earlier by the CHARMM community to improve

modeling of protein backbones.96 Unfortunately, the resulting force field modifications ultimately did not improve the agreement of MD with primary NMR data for RNA
tetranucleotides.143 Nevertheless, the computations identified some major structural determinants of the spurious intercalated structures, that is, an overpopulation of gauche+ states for the α and ζ backbone dihedral angles. This led to the suggestion that ad hoc corrections penalizing these rotamers could improve agreement between MD and NMR ensembles. Such ad hoc corrections did indeed prove useful for several tetranucleotides and tetraloops, although they remained short of fully resolving
the force-field problems.163 Another systematic study of RNA tetranucleotides simulated 48 different tetranucleotide sequences together with their DNA
counterparts.619 The RNA tetranucleotides were simulated using the χOL3 force field (see section 3.1.2.1) for 1 μs, and the
authors used the TIP4P-Ew model620 for water instead of the
more common TIP3P.576 While simulations on this time scale could not be converged, they confirmed that intercalated structures with out-of-order stacking are a hallmark of all RNA tetranucleotide simulations. Kinetics of sampling of different parts of the conformational space of tetranucleotides has been investigated with Markov state models (MSM) (see section 3.2.3) in conjunction with
simulations using the χOL3 force field.222 Initially, the
simulations consistently predicted significant populations of the spurious intercalated structures. To overcome this problem, the authors constructed a reduced MSM in which the spurious intercalated structures were manually removed from the data. After this cleaning of the data, the authors were able to extract kinetics for the formation of stacking interactions that were
qualitatively consistent with experimental results.224 For r(AAAA), the process occurring on the slowest time scale after filtering out the intercalated structures was associated with conversions between different stacked structures rather than a helix−coil transition. Although the comparison with experiment in this case was only indirect, calculated kinetic properties could be useful for validating estimates of barriers associated with conformational transitions. In conclusion, RNA tetranucleotides represent valuable systems for testing both the accuracy of molecular mechanics force fields and the validity and efficiency of enhanced sampling methods. They are the first (and so far only) RNA systems for which a full sampling of the folding landscape has been achieved by using enhanced sampling methods and pushing the
limits of the capabilities of contemporary computers.139 Existing force fields do not offer satisfactory accuracy for
these systems.120,139,242,259,271,614−616 Exact reasons for these force-field imbalances are currently unknown, and may include a combination of diverse factors such as inaccurate descriptions of base stacking, overstabilization of H-bonds involving the nonbridging phosphate oxygens, and inaccurate description of RNA backbone rotamer families. In addition to effects arising from the deficiencies of the solute force field, inconsistencies between the RNA force field and the simple water models used in the simulations may also contribute to the observed
simulation behavior.126 This suggestion is supported by the above-noted sensitivity of the results to the choice of water model, and by the inability to identify salient and systematic force-field imbalances using large-scale QM calculations on
RNA tetranucleotides.113 The currently available results have confirmed that tuning of dihedral parameters is not sufficient to fully correct the tetranucleotide simulations, although some
improvement can be achieved in this way. Undoubtedly, NMR
studies on RNA tetranucleotides614−616 constitute a vital source of experimental data against which all future force-field modifications must be benchmarked, although achieving good agreement with experiment for RNA tetranucleotides will not necessarily guarantee improved global force-field behavior due to the high risk of overfitting to a specific class of systems (section 3.1.1.3).
4.2. RNA Hairpin Tetraloops: Pushing Predictive Simulations to Their Limits
The RNA stem-loop (hairpin) motif is the most common secondary structure element found in naturally occurring RNAs
(Figure 4).621−623 Hairpin motifs consist of a loop containing
3−7 nucleotides capping an A-form helix stem.624 Hairpin loops are usually highly organized RNA motifs with conserved structures that dictate their consensus sequences, and they allow the direction of the RNA backbone to be reversed. Most common motifs in this class are the U-turn and tetraloop (TL). U-turns are commonly found in the anticodon loop of
tRNAs625,626 but also occur in many other RNA struc
tures.627−629 TLs are the most common class of hairpin loops
in rRNA and other large RNAs.60 Hairpin loops guide folding
of RNA structures,67,68 protect mRNA from degradation,623 and provide interaction sites for RNA tertiary contacts and
protein binding.622,630−632 Because of their biological relevance, small size, and
complexity of their internal interactions,448,622,633−635 RNA hairpins have served as model systems for many experimental
studies on RNA structure, dynamics, and folding.172,636−647 They have also been the subject of numerous theoretical studies utilizing a wide portfolio of methods ranging from Rosetta de
novo modeling648 through Go̅-like models,446,447 kinetic
models,649 up to standard and enhanced sampling atomistic MD. Small hairpin motifs, and TLs in particular, have been used since the 1990s to test the accuracy of force fields used in
MD simulations.129,133,139,163,650 The most ambitious applica
tions have been simulations of folding/unfolding path
ways163,228,237,240,241,313,651,652 conducted to predict the con
formation and stability of a sequence’s native structure and key features or properties of its folding landscape such as its melting temperature, folding transition states, and kinetics. TLs have been classified into different families on the basis of phylogenetic analyses, backbone geometry, and interactions
between the loop nucleotides.60,622 Two families that are consistently recovered using different approaches are
GNRA621,653 and UNCG654 TLs, where N is any base and R is a purine. These two groups account for over 70% of all TLs
found in rRNA.621,653 The other suggested families are
CUYG,621 GANC,655 (A/U)GNN,656,657 and UUUM658,659 TLs (where Y is a pyrimidine, and M is either adenine or cytidine). The UNCG family consists of particularly stable TLs characterized by a peculiar trans-Watson−Crick/sugar-edge
base pair between G4 in the syn orientation and U140 (see Figure 32), complemented by a C3−G4 stacking interaction
and a U2−C3 type 7 base−phosphate50 (7BPh) interac
tion.633,660 GNRA TLs are characterized by a trans-sugar/ Hoogsteen (tSH) G1/A4 base pair, an N2−R3−A4 stacking interaction, and a G1(2′-OH)···R3(N7) sugar−base hydrogen
bond.661 They adopt structures featuring a sharp turn between G1 and N2 that is reminiscent of the U-turn motif. GNRA and UNCG sequences generally adopt distinct turn structures, and

the turn in the latter family was named the Z-turn because of its
similarity to Z-DNA.662 GNRA TLs are generally considered more flexible than UNCG TLs, and often participate in tertiary
contacts with other RNA elements.663 The feature that makes GNRA and UNCG TLs attractive targets for computational study is their exceptional thermody
namic stability,645 together with the fact that they are wellstructured and capable of autonomous (context-independent)
folding.67,624 However, like all RNAs, they are difficult to simulate because they have complex and rough free-energy landscapes that make simulations very susceptible to becoming kinetically trapped in local minima. TLs thus represent the smallest nontrivial model systems that exhibit every type of interaction and structural feature that is generally important in the structural dynamics of RNA, including stacking, canonical and noncanonical base pairing, base−phosphate interactions, canonical and noncanonical sugar−phosphate backbone conformations, and syn/anti nucleobase orientations. This makes these systems rather challenging to describe well with force fields. Below we present a comprehensive review of MD simulation studies on RNA TLs published between 1995 (when reasonable methods for accurately describing long-range electrostatic interactions were introduced) and 2017, including the latest applications of enhanced sampling methods and microsecond- to millisecond-long simulations. The history of TL simulations provides insight into the progress of MD methods over the last 20 years.
4.2.1. Structure and Dynamics of RNA Tetraloops. MD simulations of TLs have been surveyed with varying degrees of
comprehensiveness in earlier reviews.93,154,176,664−666 Simulations performed toward the end of the previous century primarily focused on testing the accuracy of force fields on picosecond−nanosecond time scales by evaluating structural stability of TLs in the vicinity of their native folds. Other subtle effects, such as the impact of the orientation of ribose O2′H
groups on the TL structure, specific ion interactions, ionic strength, and hydration, were also explored. TLs are highly stable in solution, and short MD simulations are therefore expected not to disrupt their experimentally
derived native structures. However, TLs are not rigid:667 they
may sample alternative substates668,669 (called minor conformations or excited conformational states) with low populations (<10%), and their dynamics may involve conformational transitions occurring on the microsecond− millisecond time scales (e.g., disruption of base pairs, base
flipping, unstacking, and sugar repuckering).668,669 The identification of these minor conformations can be essential for understanding how the internal dynamics of an RNA molecule relate to its function. However, unambiguous experimental characterization of sparsely populated RNA conformational states is very difficult, and their occurrence even for small systems such as TLs remains somewhat controversial. Given the long time scales associated with intersubstate transitions, long MD simulations would be needed to provide a complete structural description of the conformational states of TLs and their relative probabilities. It is always advisable to use the longest simulation times that are affordable with the available computer hardware, although even pushing the limits in this way will generally not be sufficient to achieve convergence in simulations of TLs. Moreover, forcefield inaccuracies can wildly distort the folding landscape. Another way to identify putative minor conformations of RNA TLs is to consider the entire collection of available experimental structures. For example, the PDB database contains several examples of GNRA and UNCG sequences in conformations that differ substantially from those associated
with their canonical fold.242,662,670 These alternative conformations are usually stabilized by contacts with other RNAs as well as proteins and ions, but they may provide useful information on the intrinsic internal dynamics (flexibility) of TLs. It is reasonable to assume that while the local context may remodel some RNA sequences, this remodeling will proceed via conformations that are energetically easy to access (see section 4.3.5). It should be emphasized that a prerequisite for any computational method to properly describe the rich ensemble of minor conformations is the ability to correctly capture the native ground-state fold and all of the signature interactions that dictate the consensus sequence associated with that native fold. Without this ability, any theoretically observed minor
conformations or folding events may be spurious.154 TLs clearly display structural conservation across a broad set of structures determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, so despite the potential (and likely) occurrence of minor conformations, they have clearly defined dominant native folds. Fluorescence spectroscopy studies have suggested that these TLs may have some inherent flexibility even in isolation. However, most of the suggested alternative conformations, such as hairpins exhibiting terminal base-pair fraying or GNRA TLs with unstacked second nucleotide of the loop, retain the
motif’s signature interactions.640,642,671 The exception is a “5′stacked” conformation in which the first three bases on the 5′end of the stem are stacked instead of the last three bases on
the 3′-end as in the native pattern.640,642 However, the 5′stacked conformation appears to be absent or rare in the structural database. Its rarity is unlikely to be due to the effects of crystal packing because the native GNRA conformation has been observed in many different X-ray crystal structures and a

wide range of structural contexts; the effects of crystal packing in at least some of these structures are certainly negligible. Consequently, the significance (population) of the 5′-stacked GNRA TL (if existing) is difficult to estimate. In summary, despite the existence of alternative structures, the dominant native TL conformations revealed by structural data are vital references and benchmarks for simulations of isolated TLs. Systematic analyses of X-ray structures have clearly shown that TLs (and especially GNRA TLs) quite frequently adopt some other alternative conformations.670 However, the formation of these alternative structures may be related to specific contexts, interactions with other RNA molecules, proteins, or crystal contacts. This suggests that these states should be less intrinsically stable than the native state and so would not be adopted by isolated TLs.
4.2.2. MD Simulations of RNA Tetraloops. To evaluate a force-field performance and/or the extent to which a simulated ensemble is representative of the full conformational space, simulations have been compared to experimental data obtained by X-ray crystallography, solution-phase NMR, and optical spectroscopy. As will be shown in the following subsections,
agreement between MD simulations and experiments depends strongly on the length of the simulations and the choice of force field. For example, NOE distances and scalar couplings, which are primarily used for solution structure determination, typically agree well with nanosecond-long MD simulations initialized from experimental structures. Transitions to potentially artificial parts of the ensemble may only occur after hundreds of nanoseconds or a few microseconds. However, once simulations reach these minima (alternative structures, often spuriously stabilized by the force field), the agreement with experiment can deteriorate considerably. One should also keep in mind a fundamental difference between computer simulations and experiments: most experiments provide information on ensemble averages, but simulations usually track one molecule over time. Consequently, simulations are more like single-molecule experiments than conventional ensemble experiments.176 Table 3 summarizes the most important features of the discussed TL MD simulation studies.

TLs have used an experimentally observed native structure determined by NMR or X-ray crystallography as their starting point. The very first MD simulation of an RNA TL was
reported in 1995 by Zichi et al.650 Simulations of a GCAA
hairpin were initialized from the NMR structure661 in explicit
water575 and ions.572 The authors performed a ∼200 ps-long simulation that required over a month of wall-clock time, corresponding to approximately 35 s per MD step. Electro
statics was modeled using Ewald summations,672 which was crucial for maintaining the stability of simulations of highly charged polymers such as RNA systems. Simulations of RNA hairpins that used truncation methods (the standard way of treating long-range electrostatics at the time) were much less
stable.673,674 The reported trajectory showed that the system was structurally stable, and the NOE distances computed for the simulated structure were consistent with the available NMR
data.661 Note that the starting NMR structures661 were determined using a simpler force field combined with NOE distance restraints, whereas the chemical model used by Zichi et al. was much more detailed and included explicit water. This more sophisticated model made the NMR-derived structure stable in simulations even without restraints, at least over the short simulated time scale. In retrospect, the results obtained by Zichi et al. can be considered trivial and entirely expected given the short simulation time scale. However, this paper provided early evidence that even the potential energy functions available in the 1990s could preserve the correct native structure of a TL on time scales of hundreds of picoseconds, indicating that the native structure corresponded to at least a local minimum on the force-field free-energy surface. At the time, the main outstanding problem with classical MD simulations was believed to be the treatment of long-range electrostatic forces. In the same year, Cheatham et al. reported one of the first nanosecond-time scale nucleic acid simulations using the
particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method,579,675 and obtained stable trajectories for several systems (including a UUCG TL) using
the ff94 force field (see section 3.1.2) in explicit water.80,576 PME revolutionized the field of RNA simulations by speeding up simulations while providing accuracy equivalent to that achieved by the Ewald summation method. It has since become a standard technique that is routinely applied in simulations of biomolecular systems in explicit solvent and using periodic simulation boxes. Therefore, 1995 can be regarded as the year in which the modern approach to MD simulation of nucleic acids was born. At the time, two alternative structures for the UUCG TL had
been suggested on the basis of NMR experiments,634,676 which differed in the details of the U1/G4 base pairing (see Figure
33). An early structure634 was subsequently replaced by a more
accurate model.676 Attempts to simulate a spontaneous transition from the incorrect conformation to one with the correct hydrogen-bond pattern were made to test the reliability of the available force fields and to evaluate different sampling methods.
In 1997, Miller and Kollman677 performed explicit solvent MD simulations of a TL but were unable to explore the transition from the incorrect TL conformation to the correct one within 2.5 ns. The authors had to replace the native riboses with deoxyriboses to facilitate a spontaneous transition between the two structures. These results highlighted the sampling limitations of MD and suggested that the optimism expressed in the earliest publications utilizing PME may have been somewhat misplaced.
One year later, Kollman et al.274 used the locally enhanced sampling (LES, see section 3.2.4) method to explore the same transition in UUCG. Using five copies of the entire loop, an incorrect-to-correct structure transition was observed after ∼200 ps. On the other hand, when the simulation was started from the correct structure, no significant change was observed for ∼750 ps. These results demonstrated the usefulness of enhanced sampling techniques and the accuracy of the available force field on short time scales in the vicinity of the native fold. Another way to substantially accelerate sampling is to replace explicit water molecules with a continuum model (see, however, section 3.2.8 for a cautionary comment). The group of Kathleen Hall published several joint computational and experimental papers that used stochastic dynamics with implicit
solvent to describe the UUCG TL.678−680 The authors compared various implicit solvation models and found that the best description of RNA molecules was obtained with the
generalized Born/surface area (GBSA)681 model. Their
simulations were shorter (∼1.2 ns) than those of Kollman,677 but were approximately 5 times faster. Transitions from the incorrect to correct UUCG structures were observed. Interestingly, LES and implicit solvation can also be combined
in a cooperative manner.275 Observing the transition from the incorrect to the correct conformation is a useful test, but at that time the simulations were too short to quantitatively estimate the relative stabilities of these different states. One way to estimate free energies for very different structures is to perform MD simulations in explicit water and then average the molecular mechanical energies and continuum-calculated solvation free energies of representative solute configurations sampled in the simula
tion.682−684 This popular technique is known as MM-PBSA
(see section 3.2.8).371 Srinivasan et al.685 used MM-PBSA to compare the free energies of the two alternative UUCG conformations as well as two different conformations of the UGAA hairpin. In both cases, the correct structures had lower free energies than the incorrect ones. Specifically, for the

The incorrect structure has a reverse-wobble base pair, whereas the correct loop conformation has a bifurcated hydrogen bond in which one of the uracil carbonyl oxygens interacts with the imino and amino groups of the guanine.

UUCG TL, the difference in free energy between the correct and incorrect conformations was estimated to be −2.7 kcal/ mol. The same work also correctly predicted the relative stability of the r(GGAC-UUCG-GUCC) dimer and hairpin as a function of the salt concentration, which was a more ambitious application. During the 1995−2000 period, alchemical free-energy simulations using the free-energy perturbation (FEP) meth
od359 were relatively new (see section 3.2.7). These techniques were used to characterize free-energy changes caused by replacing standard nucleobases with modified ones in RNA hairpins. Alchemical free-energy methods should in principle be more accurate than continuum solvent free-energy methods, although their accuracy is typically limited to only very small
structural or chemical changes.686 For instance, one group
studied the C3U substitution in the UUCG TL,687 and another used FEP to quantify the effect of G1 to inosine substitutions in
the GCAA TL,366 showing that this mutation significantly destabilizes the loop. Because of the studied systems’ construction, the initial and final states of all of these
calculations89,687 were assumed to be very similar and easy to sample over a short time scale. This was probably a reasonable assumption, supported by the good agreement of the results with experimental data.
4.2.2.2. MD Simulations of Tetraloops from 2000 to the Present. In the early 2000s, researchers started to explore the rugged free-energy landscape of TLs, expanding simulations beyond local subnanosecond motions around the native
minimum. Pande et al.228 investigated dynamics of the GCAA TL by performing multiple 10 ns MD simulations with the
GBSA implicit solvent model.681 These calculations provided insight into conformational changes within the loop associated with unstacking and flipping of residues C2 and A4, which correlated with sugar pucker dynamics. The unstacked C2
conformation was consistent with NMR measurements,667 and unstacking of C2 was also later detected in analysis of X-ray
structures.242 However, the loop distortion created by flipping out of the A4 residue, although very infrequent, deviated from the native NMR ensemble and was not compatible with the
experimental data.640 Observation of this relatively large conformational transition on such a short time scale could have been an artifact of the chosen force field and solvation
model.80,681 Interestingly, this distortion is also observed in the
crystal structures of some GNRA tetraloops bound to toxins,622 suggesting that it is an accessible higher free-energy substate. Ribonuclease toxins may exploit the loop’s partial unfolding upon binding to facilitate RNA cleavage. In 2005, the groups of Stock and Schwalbe reported a very thorough comparison between computational and NMR studies of the UUUU TL using the ff94 AMBER force
field.277 Several 10 ns simulations in explicit solvent were performed, as well as high-temperature MD and LES MD. None of the simulations yielded converged data, and some of the standard MD results had to be discarded due to base pair disruptions that occurred after a few nanoseconds. Notably, the analysis of the backbone dihedral angle distributions with respect to experimental 3J couplings and dipole−dipole crosscorrelated relaxation rates showed that the conformational space sampled by the ε and ζ angles of some loop residues was inconsistent with the experimental averages. This discrepancy was not alleviated by the increased sampling of hightemperature and LES simulations. Interestingly, the enhanced sampling and standard MD simulations differed markedly in
terms of their phosphodiester angle distributions; the fluctuations of the corresponding dihedrals were considerably more pronounced in the enhanced sampling simulations. Indeed, the flawed behavior of the ε and ζ dihedrals of the
original AMBER force field80 was later identified as one of the potential sources for the stabilization of spurious intercalated structures in simulations of single-stranded RNA tetranucleo
tides (see section 4.1).143,614 On the other hand, the MD ensemble was in good agreement with experimental NOE
distances. Finally, the authors277 found no correlation between the motions of the sugar rings and the stacking dynamics of the loop bases, which was partly inconsistent with the results of
Pande et al.228
Later, Villa and Stock688 reported internal dynamics of a 14mer UUCG hairpin in explicit solvent on a tens-of-nanoseconds time scale, and compared the results to 13C NMR spin
relaxation experiments.693 They observed a good agreement between calculated and experimental relaxation rates, steadystate NOEs, and S2 order parameters, suggesting that AMBER
ff9480 force field correctly reproduced the studied system’s dynamics on the subnanosecond time scale. Interestingly, the
TIP3P576 water model’s high diffusion constant strongly affected the estimated rotational correlation time τC, which is proportional to the inverse of the RNA hairpin rotation diffusion constant. This forced the authors to use the experimental τC value. However, the internal correlation times of the bond dipoles were calculated using results from the simulation. It is to be noted that these experiments were not sensitive to motions occurring at time scales much slower than the overall molecular tumbling time (∼2 ns). Consequently, any internal motions occurring on longer time scales, such as large amplitude collective motions, would not be
reflected in the experimental data.668
In a later work,689 the Stock and Schwalbe groups reported a combined 13C NMR spin relaxation and MD study on the CACG and UUCG TLs at various submelting temperatures. These TLs have similar native conformations but differ in their thermal stability, having Tm values of ∼300 and ∼350 K, respectively. The only structural element that exhibited significant dynamics in both hairpins was the flipped out A2/ U2 nucleobase. It should be noted that the simulations were not performed at the same temperature as the experiments. The justification for this choice was presented in an earlier work conducted by the same group, in which T-REMD simulations of the same systems were used to calculate their melting
temperatures.236 The force field appeared to overestimate the melting temperatures for both TLs. Despite this, a comparison of the measured and calculated S2 order parameters suggested a convincing overall agreement between experiment and theory. Because the MD simulations were run for about 50 ns, they revealed some unexpected conformational transitions that occurred on a nanosecond time scale, such as syn/anti transitions and losses of stacking interactions, which could not be detected by the NMR data. This was an early indication that longer simulations might reveal new problems. A related work compared NMR and MD, with 100 ns MD
simulation using the CHARMM36 force field98 characterizing the internal motions of the apical RNA stem of the human
hepatitis B virus.694 Again, the NMR relaxation rates calculated directly from the trajectory agreed well with experiments. Although the works cited above achieved good agreement with experiment, their results should be considered in light of

later efforts that have highlighted the force-field problems exposed by long TL simulations (see section 4.2.2.3).
In 2007, Deng and Cieplak235 estimated the relative stability of single-stranded, duplex, and hairpin conformations of the UUUU TL monomer and dimer as a function of the temperature. They used the MM-PBSA method to process
the MD trajectories.371 The resulting free-energy profiles supported a shift in the conformational equilibrium from duplex to hairpin as the temperature was increased, in
agreement with NMR results.695 ΔH values calculated at different temperatures for the hairpin to single-stranded chain transition were qualitatively consistent with the experimental values. However, it is not clear whether the reported ∼100 ns simulations were sufficiently long to correctly sample the singlestranded RNA’s conformational space. The same authors also reported an enhanced sampling
simulation of UUCG and UUUU TLs159 in which the potential of mean force (PMF) as a function of the end-to-end distance was determined by umbrella sampling (US; see section 3.2.5) in
explicit TIP3P576 water. Results obtained with both ff9480 and
CHARMM2789 were reported. The authors compared relative stabilities of the native structure (which has a low end-to-end distance) and the unfolded structure (which has a high end-toend distance). The AMBER force-field simulations predicted a
native state stability consistent with experiment,641 whereas CHARMM27 simulations clearly predicted one of the loops to be unstable. Note that the results for both loops may have been biased by the fact that the simulations were initialized by steering in one direction only and starting from the native structure (see section 3.2.5). This procedure is expected to overestimate the stability of the folded state. Hysteresis effects
are common in US but not always taken into consideration.283 The first comprehensive comparison of the most common force fields for TL simulations was presented in 2010 by Banas
et al.133 The authors performed MD simulations of UUCG, GAGA, and GAAA TLs on the submicrosecond time scale using several AMBER force-field variants with different dihedral
corrections94,95,136,696 as well as CHARMM27.89 None of the studied TLs was described entirely satisfactorily, and at least some signature interactions were lost in all cases. Note that, unlike some other studies, this work monitored all of the signature features of the studied TLs. Importantly, the TLs were found to be stable on submicrosecond time scales with the
χOL3 RNA force field,94 which was used for the first time in this work (see section 3.1.2.1). Without this critical correction of the RNA dihedral potential, the GNRA TL degraded into ladder-like structures (see Figure 7). In addition to eliminating ladder-like artifacts, the χOL3 parameters greatly improved the
description of the UUCG TL because the modification of the syn region stabilized the signature U/G(syn) base pair. The CHARMM27 simulations predicted an unrealistic progressive fraying of the stem due to the disruption of canonical base pairing. A-RNA melting is a common problem in CHARMM RNA simulations, and may still be problematic with the
CHARMM36 reparameterization (section 3.1.3).134,137 Despite the growing amount of evidence highlighting the deficiencies of RNA force fields (see section 3.1), two publications reported computations that successfully recapitu
lated experimental results for TLs. Chakraborty et al.691 studied folding kinetics of UUCG and GCAA hairpins in implicit solvent and characterized their kinetics by analyzing preliminary 200 ns-long plain MD simulation using the discrete path sampling method, which is a general non-MD method for
computing transition rates between metastable states.697 The MD simulations were only used to seed the subsequent discrete path sampling mapping of the conformational space. It should be noted that because of the implicit solvent approximation, the local minima identified in this work can be regarded as freeenergy minima for which the solvent degrees of freedom have been averaged out (see section 3.2.8). The authors reported results in agreement with experimental kinetic measurements, suggesting that the process of folding from relatively compact states was characterized by short paths and occurs on microsecond time scales. Conversely, extended states (which were only sparsely populated at 298 K) reached the native state via much longer routes, and were associated with lower folding rate constants. Obviously, systematic conformational searches in implicit solvent have their own limitations, and there is currently limited experience with their application to nucleic acids.
Giambasu et al.692 reported an extensive comparison to NMR data for the UUCG RNA hairpin based on a high
resolution solution structure.698 Multiple 300 ns simulations on a UUCG TL construct initialized in the native state were
analyzed using both ff9990 and χOL3
94 force fields. Production runs were performed in the constant energy ensemble to minimize the thermostat’s effects on the system’s dynamics. The work found good agreement with NMR data, including NOEs, order parameters, and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). RDCs report on the relative orientation of chemical bonds at distant positions, thus providing long distance information. The experimentally observed NMR structure and fluctuations were accurately reproduced by the simulations, suggesting that the experimental ensemble was well represented by the free-energy basin sampled in the simulations. The χOL3
force field offered better accuracy than the ff99 variant. However, exploration of the conformational space was still limited to the region close to the native structure, so these simulations cannot be regarded as a test of global force-field accuracy. Besides modeling of true RNA hairpins, MD simulations of TL-like single-strand overhangs of A-RNA stems were used to explain a series of experiments in which slow spontaneous ligation and cleavage reactions were detected in complementary
oligoC/oligoG RNA constructs.699 These results may be essential for understanding the transition between organic molecules and biopolymers leading to the emergence of life on the Earth (see section 4.8.8).
4.2.2.3. Folding Simulations of RNA Tetraloops. All works discussed above presented trajectories that were initialized in the native state. This induces a strong initialization bias (see section 3.2.1) toward the known experimental structure. Ideally, MD simulations should be able to predict the native structure from an unfolded one. One possible approach to structure
prediction is to use fast modeling tools700 to produce putative structures and then use a force field for structural refinement, as
was done by Maier et al.701 These authors generated structures for the GGGCGNRAGCCU sequence (R = A/G, N = any)
using MC-SYM,467 a structural bioinformatics tool, and then minimized these structures using an implicit solvent model. However, energy minimization alone cannot generally be expected to find structures that differ substantially from the starting structure, so the accuracy of predictions based on this method is very sensitive to the accuracy of the modeling tool used in the first step, and we will not address such procedures further. The only way to search for the global free-energy

minimum of an RNA TL using MD is to perform extremely long MD simulations or to use enhanced sampling methods (see section 3.2).
In 2003, the Pande group651 reported a study involving a large number of independent simulations of a GCAA TL performed with a distributed computer framework (folding@
home)74,75 and multiplexed replica-exchange MD method, a
variant of the T-REMD technique (see section 3.2.4).702 They collected over 500 μs of total simulation time using multiple simulation methodologies (with the individual simulations starting from both native and extended states), representing a significant advance in the field. For comparative purposes, the year before, the same group published multiple MD simulations
of the same system with a total time of 0.1 μs.228 Distributed computing using ∼40 000 processors via folding@home made it possible for the first time to compare experimental data to an MD ensemble beyond the native minima and thus to test the force field’s predictive power by starting simulations from the denatured state at room temperature. This was also the first application of a methodology based on the parallel tempering (T-REMD) strategy to RNA folding (see section 3.2.4). Simulations that began close to the native structure achieved good agreement with experimental NOE distances. However, despite the impressive overall simulation length, the ensemble was not converged, and it was thus not clear whether the ff94 energy model was capable of correctly predicting the experimental structure. Relaxation times estimated for the collapse of the hairpin into a native-like conformation from the unfolded states were consistent with the kinetics observed experimentally for DNA hairpin folding (1−10 μs). Two competing folding/unfolding mechanisms were observed, but these results should be treated with caution because of the known inaccuracies of the force field (see section 3.1.2.1) and mainly the use of an implicit GB solvent model used in the study. Two years later, the same group studied the role of explicit
water and ions on the folding mechanism of GCAA TL.652 The use of explicit solvation yielded a more varied and complex
folding mechanism than was previously reported.651 This work suggested that explicit water plays an important structural role in RNA folding that cannot be easily captured by implicit solvent models. For this reason, explicit solvation has been preferred to implicit solvent models in most computational studies.
The folding@home infrastructure74 was also used by
Bowman et al.,690 who reported a structural analysis of folding intermediates for the GCAA TL. Here, a total of 54 μs of MD was performed using a replica-exchange-like scheme in explicit water. Statistical convergence was not achieved, but the authors did observe some folding and unfolding events. However, the TL structure was not discussed in detail, and the detected folding events may actually have formed non-native TL structures. Yet another study using the folding@home
massively parallel MD infrastructure74 examined the equili
brium conformational dynamics of the GCAA TL,221 with total simulated time of more than 100 μs. Despite this, the individual trajectories were probably too short to reveal the problems of the available ff94 force field. In fact, Figure 3 from ref 221 clearly shows that the results were not converged and that the population of the native cluster decreased over the full simulation time scale, suggesting the native state would vanish if the simulations were extended for long enough.
Several other works have reported nonconverged replica exchange MD simulations starting from the native TL structure. For instance, various groups have performed T-REMD simulations starting from the native structures of several
sequences.234,236,243,244 While these simulations could provide insights into the large-scale dynamics around the native state and the thermostability of the studied molecules, they cannot be used to evaluate a force field’s ability to predict known experimental structures. In fact, the published data (where available) typically indicate that the force fields tend to lose at least some of the studied system’s native interactions. Perhaps the first report of predictive folding of an RNA TL
was presented by Garcia and Paschek.237 These authors used
the AMBER ff99 force field90 with explicit water576 in conjunction with T-REMD based on 52 replicas at temperatures between 270 and 600 K. The simulations were initialized in the unfolded state, with no bias toward the native structure. The authors reported the folded state to be more stable than the unfolded state by 2.4 kJ/mol. However, some of the structures regarded as “folded” deviated markedly from the native structure, having RMSD values of up to 5−6 Å. While it is possible that the reported simulations were statistically converged, they did not reproduce the stability observed experimentally, again probably due to problems of the ff99
force field that was later shown to be inadequate for TLs.94 Figures included in the paper clearly show that the TL itself was not structured, and the stem appeared to adopt a spurious
ladder-like conformation.133 A later publication by the same
group discussed the limitations of this attempt in detail.120 A subsequent attempt at folding from the unfolded state was made by Kuhrova et al. using extensive T-REMD simulations of
UUCG and GAGA TLs.240 The χOL3 force field94,95 was used, and 48 replica simulations of 400 ns each were initiated from the unfolded state. Essentially only non-native states were populated. Although transient native-like structures were found, the results suggested that even the latest force field could not reproduce the correct experimental structures. Crucially, the authors used very strict criteria for identifying the folded structure, requiring all of the signature interactions to be present at the same time for the TL to be considered folded. This definition is consistent with that preferred by the RNA
structure prediction community,52 and must be used to avoid including false positive folding events. Inadequacy of the RMSD metric for identifying native-like structures, especially when using loose thresholds of the order of 4 Å or more, was
clearly discussed.240 For the GAGA TL, one complete folding event was observed. The UUCG TL was even more difficult to fold due to the G in the loop, which should flip from anti (favored in single-stranded RNA) to syn (favored in the TL). The UUCG structure sampled during the MD that was closest to the experimental one had the G in the anti state. The authors suggested, based on a thermodynamic integration calculation, that the force field would have correctly predicted the syn conformation to be more stable for the TL, but the transition was not observed, probably because of the still short time scale of the T-REMD run. The same group subsequently reported unbiased 10-μs-long MD simulations of the same two TLs
using the χOL3 force field and WT-metadynamics.313 That work
again confirmed that the native structure was a local free-energy minimum of the χOL3 force field, achieving stable dynamics on time scales of a few microseconds. However, the metadynamics simulations confirmed that the native structure does not

correspond to the global minimum in terms of the force-field free energy. In an attempt to resolve the TL folding problem, Chen and Garcia modified the vdW term of the force field (see section
3.1.2.4).120 Because base stacking propensity was reported to be
overestimated by the original force field,111,124 they revised Lennard-Jones nonbonded parameters. They attempted to fold three TLs using the revised Lennard-Jones parameters for the nucleobases together with a new reparameterization of the glycosidic torsion, providing total dihedral energy profiles similar to χOL3 (Figure 9). The bsc0 correction for the backbone was omitted in this work. Perhaps most importantly, to allow separate tuning of the RNA−water and RNA−RNA interactions, the suggested modifications included a breakdown of the standard combination rules for vdW parameters adopted in the AMBER force field. This approach is known as the NBfix method and effectively increases the number of tunable parameters (see section 3.1.2.4). Without this, the new vdW parameters might perform worse than the original ones. Promising results were obtained: by simulating 64 replicas from the unfolded state for 200−400 ns each, the authors reported folding events for two of the three investigated TLs. However, the agreement between the reported ensembles and the experimental structures was still not completely satisfactory (Figure 34). The fraction of folded structures was defined using a quite generous threshold for agreement with experiment (4 Å RMSD), which is not sufficient to unambiguously identify
folding, as shown subsequently,223 and could even include
ladder-like artifacts.240 From cluster analysis, the cluster with the highest relative population was within 1 Å RMSD of the native structure. However, given the reported populations of
structures with low RMSD separations from the native conformation, it seems that the absolute population of this cluster was small. Nevertheless, these results suggested that correcting nonbonded force-field parameters (most likely including NBfix, see section 3.1.2.4) may be essential for prediction of RNA structures by MD. Cheatham’s group subsequently reported an exhaustive benchmark for tetranucleotides and TLs using the most
relevant RNA force fields,139 including that developed by
Chen and Garcia120 and χOL3.94,240 The alternative vdW parameters for the phosphate group suggested by Case and
co-workers (CP)150 were also tested. The stability of the UUCG TL was evaluated by performing multidimensional replica exchange MD simulations (see section 3.2.4) with
hundreds of replicas lasting for multiple μs each.139 The authors claimed convergence for the sampling of the TL structure when full pairing was enforced in the base pair stem below the TL. Because of this enforcement of stem base pairing, the simulation still cannot be regarded as an example of predictive folding. In addition, the convergence was reported to be convincing for the results obtained at 277 K but somewhat less
convincing for those at 300 K.139 This highlights the unprecedented scale of the sampling problem even for the folding of very short RNA sequences. The key finding of these impressive calculations was that none of the tested force fields could reproduce the correct experimental structure. Of the tested force fields, that of Chen and Garcia provided the highest populations of properly folded TL structures at ∼277 K: ∼10%
using the signature interactions133,240 criteria, and ∼35% using
a 4 Å RMSD120 threshold. However, at room temperature, the population of properly folded TL dropped to ∼1%. Perhaps, the native-like cluster is enthalpically stabilized, and other conformations with greater conformational entropy might occur at higher temperatures. When discussing these results, it is also important to remember that the simulations were started from the folded state. This, together with the restraints imposed to preserve pairing in the stem, may artificially facilitate the persistence of the population of folded TL structures at low temperatures. Further, different force fields might need different time scales to achieve convergence.
These studies were extended by Kuhrova et al.,129 who performed extensive T-REMD, REST2, and WT-metadynamics (see sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.5) simulations of the GAGA TL, which is believed to be an easier folding target than the UNCG TL, using every relevant RNA force field available at the time. The results clearly showed that no force field could maintain the correct folded TL structures, as confirmed by different enhanced sampling simulations starting from unfolded state and folded state ensembles (Figure 35). The criterion used to detect correct formation of the native structure was based on the presence of all of the TL’s signature interactions. While some folding events satisfying this criterion were observed in 2μs T-REMD simulations, bootstrapping analysis revealed that none of the force fields achieved a folding of the TL with a statistically significant population at any temperature. That is, all of the error bars corresponding to confidence intervals constructed at the 5% significance level contained zero population. The study also analyzed the key force-field deficiencies that prevent successful folding of RNA TLs. Underestimation of the free energy of base pairing was suggested to be a fundamental problem. Subsequently, the authors proposed a gentle tunable local stabilizing potential (HBfix, see section 3.1.2.5) to support the native H-bonds.

When using this bias potential for all base pairs and TL signature interactions, the T-REMD simulations finally achieved successful complete and statistically significant folding of the GAGA TL, with all signature interactions present. We note, however, that adding a native-centric potential significantly simplifies the problem and does not correspond to a predictive simulation. Despite its structure-specificity, the HBfix potential can be clearly physically justified (see section 3.1.2.5). The authors suggested that the use of such force-field corrections may be necessary in future folding simulations of RNA molecules due to the fundamental limitations arising from the simplicity of general force fields. Other problems with current force fields were also discussed, such as overstabilization of base−phosphate and sugar−phosphate interactions. Free-energy landscape of gcGCAAgc TL was characterized by performing massive T-REMD calculations (64 replicas, 3 μs
per replica) using the Chen and Garcia force field.241 The simulations revealed reversible folding/unfolding transitions of the TL into the canonical A-RNA conformation and the presence of two alternative configurations, including a lefthanded Z-RNA conformation (the same cluster was reported in
an independent work129) and a compact purine triplet. These structures were not directly compared to experimental data. The authors also reported that the stability of the folded structure at 310 K was approximately 10 kJ/mol. However, the folded structure was identified by dihedral principal component analysis, so it was not easy to determine whether the corresponding structures actually exhibited the signature interactions present in the native structures. If the global free-energy minimum predicted by the force field corresponds to a structure that differs from the correct native structure, any sufficiently long simulation will depart from the native structure without any significant probability of
Figure 35. Folding of gcGAGAgc TL using extended T-REMD simulations from the unfolded state. The folding in this figure is assessed on the basis of strict structural criteria, thus avoiding the false-positive results that commonly occur when folding is judged on the basis of some RMSD metrics. Results are shown for a number of force fields: χOL3 in net-neutralizing cation atmosphere (χOL3 - neut.), χOL3 in 1 M salt (χOL3 - 1M), χOL3 with
hydrogen-bond fix (HBfix) in 1 M salt (χOL3HB - 1M), χOL3 with modified phosphate parameters in 1 M salt (χOL3CP - 1M), χOL3 combining HBfix
with the modified phosphate parameters in 1 M salt (χOL3CP - HB - 1M), and the Chen and Garcia force field (ff99Chen).

visiting it again. In such cases, most of the simulation time will be wasted only to confirm the eventual loss of the structure. This problem can be alleviated by combining T-REMD with WT-metadynamics, especially when using a collective variable (CV) that properly distinguishes the native structure from the competing ones. This approach has been applied to the UUCG and GAGA TLs,163 using εRMSD223 as a biased CV. εRMSD measures the discrepancy between two structures by comparing the relative positions and orientations of nucleobases that are within a given distance cutoff. It can thus provide a continuous measure of the “discrepancy in the annotation” made using the Leontis−Westhof definition.40 εRMSD-based biasing allows near-native structures to be visited even if they do not correspond to the force-field free-energy minimum, enabling
estimation of their (in)stability (see section 3.2.5). This work confirmed the instability of both TLs under the current AMBER force field. However, the work also suggested that small empirically based changes in the dihedral potential parameters for α and ζ might reduce the problem, as these modifications improved the stability of GAGA TL. However, their general applicability to common RNA molecules remains to be determined. Furthermore, for the UUCG TL, the dihedral corrections did not significantly improve the results. In addition to analyzing the energetics of the folding landscape, the authors also compared their simulations to previously published NOE data.667,698 This analysis confirmed that, at least for the UUCG TL, primary experimental data can only be reproduced using conformations with well-structured TLs (see Figure 36). Thus,

Selection criteria are discussed in detail in ref 163 and are based on εRMSD. Whereas native NMR models and structures selected to be similar to the native one satisfy almost all of the NOEs, the other two data sets display a large number of violations. Remarkably, if all of the snapshots where the stem is correctly folded are included (E), the number of violations is larger than in the case where only incorrect structures are included (F). This indicates that the employed χOL3 force field alone is not capable of reproducing a loop structure compatible with solution NMR data even if the stem is constrained.

to be compatible with experimental data, MD simulations must predict dominant populations for structures with low εRMSD deviations from the native structure; that is, all of the TL signature interactions must be correctly formed.
4.2.2.4. Take-Home Message from Tetraloop Simulations. As described above, many published works have attempted to elucidate the structure and dynamics of GNRA, UNCG, and selected other TLs using MD simulations. Most of them used experimental structures as their starting points. These simulations were very informative in that they predicted the local dynamics of the TLs, sometimes achieving good agreement with experimental data. However, this was only true for simulations that were short enough to avoid leaving the vicinity of the initial native structure. The availability of more powerful computers combined with massively parallel simulation methods and enhanced sampling techniques revealed several problems with modern force fields. In particular, enhanced sampling simulations can easily access structures that would only be observed in plain MD simulations that were several orders of magnitude longer. This is very useful for exposing spurious structures that are unrealistically stabilized by the force field. The reviewed works clearly show that current force fields cannot blindly predict the structure of RNA TLs. Because TLs are relatively small systems, which nevertheless contain all key interactions and energetic contributions that control RNA folding, they are important test systems for evaluating the accuracy of RNA force fields. Note that some claims in the literature about successful folding of TLs must be carefully interpreted; cf., discussion in refs 129 and 139 and section 4.2.2.3. In terms of sampling, the studies discussed above show that TLs are either beyond or at the very limits of the degree of complexity that can be explored ergodically by MD, even when using enhanced sampling methods. This makes the necessary simulations very expensive and difficult to reproduce. We suggest that it could be useful if researchers in the field cooperated more closely, notably by freely sharing simulation data that are useful for force-field testing and parameterization. Obviously, sharing trajectories that include all solvent molecules would not be straightforward. However, removing water greatly reduces the amount of data to share. For example, TL trajectories encoded in the gromacs compressed format result in ∼20 MB per 20 000 frames (https://github.com/ srnas/tetraloops-trajectories), which corresponds to 1 μs with a 50 ps stride. Such sharing of data could enable small changes to variables such as dihedral parameters to be tested using
reweighting techniques (see section 3.1.4).143,163 It is always important to consider how MD data are compared to experiments. TLs tend to be highly structured RNAs, and one can safely assume that to a first approximation the native state will be represented by a single conformation. This conformation should be dominantly populated in an accurate MD simulation. This also implies that one must be careful when comparing predicted structures to experimental ones. In particular, commonly used trivial metrics such as RMSD may not reliably identify correctly folded RNA
structures.223 It is worth noting that the RNA structure
prediction community465 uses several different criteria to score the agreement of predicted structures with experiment.
Measures such as εRMSD223 or interaction network fidelity332 directly report on the differences in the base-pairing and base
stacking with respect to a reference structure,52 and should be preferred.
Agreement based on these metrics correlates strongly with the formation of all of the correct signature interactions. However, the ideal way of verifying the correctness of MD simulations of TLs and other RNA systems is still comparison to primary data from solution-phase experiments (i.e., various NMR parameters) if available. Seen in their wider context and with an appropriate degree of realism, the results obtained to date in MD simulations of TLs are not especially promising, in terms of either force-field performance or sampling. The take-home message from benchmark RNA simulations that have been reported (see also section 4.1) is that modern force fields struggle to achieve a balanced description of stacking, hydrogen bonding, backbone substates, and solvation. In addition, the difficulty of achieving convergence for TLs raises major questions about the likelihood of achieving convergence (and thus obtaining a comprehensive description of the full folding landscape) for more complicated RNA systems. It should be noted that this pessimistic outlook does not preclude the possibility that MD can be useful in studies on various RNAs. The goal of simulations discussed in section 4.2.2.3 was to achieve full folding of TLs, that is, to make structure predictions without using any starting knowledge about the sequence’s native structure. This is definitely the most challenging task in the field, and is currently beyond the capabilities of atomistic MD
simulations.175 However, when MD simulations are applied to larger systems with the goal of sampling local fluctuations around the native structure, they are much more reliable. In addition, due to compensation of errors, the simulation quality does not need to deteriorate as the studied system’s size and complexity increase (see, e.g., section 4.7.1). In fact, although TLs are physically small systems, their folding is governed by a very intricate balance of various energy terms, making them naturally exceptionally difficult to describe accurately with force fields. Moreover, conformational transitions to spurious structures usually involve cooperative rearrangements associated with large free-energy barriers. Therefore, they are likely to be rare events that happen on relatively long time scales, especially for large RNA structures. Consequently, large RNA molecules can be often simulated on time scales of hundreds of nanoseconds or even microseconds without incurring significant problems. Such simulations can provide very useful information that would not be accessible using experimental methods alone. Nevertheless, MD simulations of RNA must be done with great care and validated against experimental data, with in-depth analysis of their structural details. In addition, to facilitate the improvement of force fields, sampling techniques, and simulation methods, the occurrence of spurious structures stabilized by force fields should be reported openly. This has not always been the case in the MD simulation literature, which has slowed progress in the force-field development. Further, simulations that are not based on reliable experimental starting structures should be done only exceptionally, and their outcomes will always be speculative.
4.3. MD Simulations of Internal Loops and Other Small RNA Molecules
As noted in section 2.2, canonical helices are represented as formally base-paired segments in RNA 2D diagrams, and sequence alignments usually reveal a free covariation of GC, CG, AU, and UA base pairs in canonical RNA segments. The G/U wobble base pair (Figure 2G) is the
third RNA canonical base pair.47 Thermodynamically, canonical

A-RNA regions represent the dominant source of stability of RNA molecules, and kinetic studies indicate that they usually
form before tertiary structural features.45,443 Canonical helices alternate with formally unpaired 2D loop regions, generally the most functionally important parts of RNA mole
cules.41,52−55,59,61,703,704 Many of them form highly specific 3D structures that serve as molecular building blocks and have
characteristic sequence patterns.41,49,52,53,59,705 They can be
formally classified as hairpin,621−629 inter

4.3.1. Basic Introduction to the Structural Organization of RNA Internal Loops. So-called RNA motifs are
small ordered arrays of noncanonical base pairs39 and
interactions such as base-phosphate H-bonds50 that are subject to sequence constraints, as characterized by seminal works by
Leontis, Westhof, and co-workers.41,52−55,59,61 This means that a change in one nucleotide of the motif must be accompanied by changes in other coupled positions to preserve the motif’s function (which is given by its 3D structure). In other words, each RNA motif has some consensus sequence that is determined by its signature interactions. Canonical base pairs are present in some RNA motifs but not all. Roughly speaking, RNA motifs constitute a second level in the structural hierarchy
of RNA, above the level of base pairs.39,40 They have the following characteristic properties: (1) They are modular and can thus be seen as undividable, discrete units. This precludes experimental dissection of the thermodynamic effects of their individual H-bonding and stacking interactions because disrupting one native interaction may cause the entire motif
to collapse.54 (2) They are usually autonomous (but not inevitably; see below for examples); that is, they may occur in different molecular contexts but will generally fold into their sequence-dictated characteristic geometry independently of the
context. (3) They are usually recurrent.54,55 This means that they occur in diverse evolutionarily unrelated RNA molecules or even multiple times in the same molecule. The same motifs thus appear to have evolved convergently in different molecules. (4) They are multipurpose. For example, depending on the context, a given motif may participate in protein binding or RNA−RNA interactions, or may undergo dynamic motions. Over 100 distinct RNA motifs have been recorded in a database of RNA 3D structures (http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/
pdb).49,61 Some motifs have only been observed in one particular RNA, while others are ubiquitous. Most known motifs were identified by analyzing ribosomal X-ray structures. (5) RNA motifs adhere strongly to the isostericity principle, as
demonstrated by their signature interactions.42,49,61 In keeping with these properties, sequence alignments of corresponding RNAs from diverse organisms have shown that if a motif is present at a given position in the RNA of one organism, other organisms will typically have a sequence that complies with the consensus of that motif in the same position. At specific locations harboring an RNA motif that allows sequence variability, evolutionary processes have often produced a context- and function-dependent variant of the motif that preserves the motif’s core signature interactions while modulating its variable features. This enables development of new signature-like interactions and sequence constraints that characterize the corresponding region of the RNA in
question.55,61 Canonical A-RNA could be regarded as a motif with the (NN)n consensus, that is, an array of n consecutive
canonical (NN) base pairs with any sequence.
If a sequence pattern associated with a recurrent RNA motif is detected in an RNA sequence of unknown structure, one can quite confidently predict that the corresponding section of the
RNA will adopt the motif’s 3D structure.49,61 Such predictions are especially reliable when a sequence pattern consistent with the motif consensus sequence is identified by sequence alignment in multiple equivalent RNAs from different species. Conversely, the sequence patterns of smaller submotifs (see section 2.2) are too ambiguous to be a reliable basis for structural predictions. A notable omnipresent submotif is the UA_handle, which beautifully illustrates the extreme versatility
of RNA structural organization.65 Another well-known example
is the RNA dinucleotide platform.714−718 Because of their small sizes, internal structural stability, and biological relevance, RNA motifs represent obvious targets for studies using explicit solvent MD simulations. MD simulations can provide information about the impact of base substitutions in RNA motifs as well as their structured hydration, ion-binding properties, intrinsic flexibility, interactions with ligands and proteins, and other features of interest. Several following sections provide an overview of the MD simulation literature relating to mainly internal loop RNA motifs and some other small RNA building blocks.
4.3.2. 5S rRNA Loop E and Other Well-Paired Symmetrical Internal Loops. The bacterial 5S rRNA Loop E (LE) motif is an internal 14-nucleotide loop forming seven
consecutive noncanonical base pairs.51,484−487,525−527,719 It is localized roughly in the middle of the bacterial 5S rRNA (its loop E region), the smaller rRNA of the bacterial large ribosomal subunits. It is one of the longest known fully paired double helical regions with consecutive noncanonical base pairs. In bacteria, the first submotif of the LE interacts with ribosomal
protein L25,51,527 while its second submotif participates in RNA−RNA interactions. Although the precise function of the 5S rRNA is unknown, it is widely assumed to play a role in dynamic intersubunit communication during elongation. The original nomenclature for LE motifs was somewhat ambiguous and was confused with that of another RNA motif,
the Sarcin-Ricin loop528,529 (SRL, see section 4.3.6). This is because the equivalent regions of archaeal and eukaryal 5S rRNAs are different from the bacterial region, and form SRL motifs (for more details, see refs 56 and 51; the latter paper is separating the bacterial LE from SRL) (Figure 37). The LE motif consists of two submotifs separated by a water-mediated A/G base pair and related by dyadic rotational symmetry. The LE and SRL were among the first RNA motifs to be discovered, and were structurally characterized before the solution of any
ribosomal X-ray structures.525−529 Their investigations were central to the formulation of the rules of RNA sequence
conservation (i.e., the isostericity principle).51 The bacterial 5S rRNA LE has been subject of several MD simulation studies that helped to establish MD as a valid
complement to experimental methods.484−487 Although these studies were conducted with time scales ranging from 1 to 25 ns and using the ff94-ff99 AMBER force fields (see section 3.1.2), their results are considered to be reliable. For example, MD was used to clarify the relationship between the bacterial
and spinach chloroplast 5S rRNA LE motifs.484 Chloroplasts are evolutionarily related to bacteria, suggesting that their ribosomal structures should closely resemble those in bacteria. However, the sequences of the E. coli 5S rRNA LE (for which X-ray structures are available) and the presumably equivalent spinach chloroplast rRNA region differ substantially, with only

64% sequence identity (9 nucleotides out of 14). Nevertheless, the early works of Leontis and Westhof on base pair classification and the isostericity principle indicated that these two RNA regions may in fact form identical (isosteric)
structures.51 Leontis and Sponer then probed this prediction
using MD simulations.484 A hypothetical starting structure of the spinach chloroplast LE motif was prepared by homology modeling, using the bacterial LE X-ray structure as a template. Subsequent simulations neatly relaxed the chloroplast sequence into a structure isosteric with the bacterial LE. It should be noted that by modern standards, these simulations were rather
short, so the results obtained may have been significantly affected by the chosen starting structure. In addition, they were performed with an outdated force field, so it might be interesting to reinvestigate these structures using modern tools and methods. However, the simulations’ results were independently confirmed by NMR experiments on the spinach chloroplast LE, which strongly supported its isostericity with
the bacterial variant.719 In addition, the spinach chloroplast LE
variant binds the bacterial L25 protein.719 Good correspondence between MD simulations, experiments, and bioinformatics data for the LE motif shows that when an appropriate question is asked, MD can provide correct answers even with modest computational efforts. In fact, studies on the impact of base substitutions in known RNA structures represent one of the most appropriate applications of MD simulations. The MD method is especially efficient for well base-paired regions, that is, canonical helices and fully paired symmetrical N×N internal 2D loops. The N×N internal loop is an RNA segment in which each strand contains N nucleobases that do not form canonical base pairs with their partners. Thus, the LE motif is a 7×7 internal loop. Such long internal loops are quite rare, and shorter 1×1, 2×2, and 3×3 symmetrical internal loops are more common. The reason why MD simulations of well base-paired double helical RNA segments using the AMBER variants of the force field are usually successful stems from the fundamentals of the force field’s derivation (see section 3.1.1). This force field provides a rather good description of both base stacking and base pairing because of the original parameterization strategy of the Cornell et al. force field, whose partial atomic charges (which are still used even in the latest variants of the force field) were derived by fitting to the molecular electrostatic
potential (ESP).80 QM studies have demonstrated that such ESP-fitted charge distributions are very suitable for base stacking and base pairing calculations, including for RNA
base pairs that interact via the 2′-OH hydroxyl group.104,721,722 The alternative CHARMM force field provides less structurally stable trajectories for paired RNA duplexes; see also section 3.1.3. For example, simulations using the CHARMM27 force
field155,156 predicted nanosecond-scale base pair opening rates
for AU base pairs in canonical A-RNA duplexes.723 This
result was initially723 considered to agree with the available
experimental base pair opening data,724 but this suggestion was
later corrected.98 In addition, large-scale fraying of RNA duplexes has been observed in longer CHARMM27 simu
lations,160,235 resulting in an effort to stabilize the CHARMM
RNA duplex simulation.98 The CHARMM36 RNA force field98 is improved in this respect, but some problems with structural
stability may remain.134 Our tests show that, as compared to all of the available alternatives, the AMBER force fields (especially the newer versions that are not prone to the formation of
ladder-like artifacts94,154) yield more structurally stable simulations of RNA double helical regions over longer time scales, and do not require the imposition of restraints on the base pairs. These properties of the CHARMM and AMBER force-field families should be borne in mind when interpreting literature reports discussing MD simulations that predict large
fluctuations in symmetrical internal RNA loops.725−727 A degree of common sense is needed when evaluating any MD data, and we strongly caution against interpreting every single fluctuation or change in base pairing as being biochemically relevant. We in fact suggest that the basic approximations of

pair-additive force fields (specifically, the lack of polarization) cause them to generally underestimate the structural stability (i.e., base pairing) of RNA double helical regions (see sections 3.1.1.3 and 3.1.2.5). Note that not all symmetrical internal loops are fully base paired, as there may be slippage of the interacting partners in the loops. The presence of unpaired nucleotides complicates computations because (i) it drastically increases the sampling requirements, and (ii) it increases the simulation’s sensitivity to inaccuracies in the description of solvation energies and other force-field issues. Both problems arise when simulating not fully paired RNA internal loops because it is necessary to sample nucleotides that fluctuate between being stacked inside the helix, bulging out into the solvent, and interacting with the double helix grooves. Any imbalance in the description of these interactions might stabilize a conformation not compatible with the experimental structure. The same problems are encountered in studies of nonsymmetrical N×M internal loops.
4.3.3. Can MD Simulations Help Explain Thermodynamic Rules? As discussed above, symmetrical internal loops are ubiquitous building blocks of RNA structures and profoundly affect the thermodynamics of RNA folding. It would therefore be exceptionally useful if MD simulations could be used to characterize their thermodynamic properties as well as their structures. The sequence-dependent thermodynamics of canonical A-RNA is very well established thanks to
the seminal measurements of Turner and co-workers.44,728,729 These benchmark thermodynamic measurements constitute the core of the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic stability model for RNA, and are essential for predicting 2D structures of RNA
sequences.46,439,730 In contrast, predicting thermodynamic
properties of internal 2D loops remains challenging.731 One reason for this is that it is not possible to easily predict the structures of internal 2D loops from their sequences; in addition, conformations of some loops can be context
dependent and thus ambiguous (see section 4.3.5).732−739 The lack of reliable information on the thermodynamics of short internal RNA loops was actually identified by experimentalists a decade ago as an important issue that could potentially be addressed by modern computational
chemistry.740 However, it is still much more difficult to accurately compute the free-energy profiles of RNA duplexes
than to simulate their structural dynamics.365,741,742 This is illustrated by a study that used thermodynamics integration (TI) free-energy calculations (see section 3.2.7) to characterize the context- and sequence-dependence of the structures of
tandem A/G base pairs in RNA duplexes.365 Tandem arrangements of A/G base pairs are common in RNA, and tandem A/G base pairs play important roles in determining the structure, dynamics, and stability of larger RNA sequences. The TI simulations evaluated free-energy differences between r(5′GCGGACGC-3′)2, r(5′-GCiGGAiCGC-3′)2, r(5′
GGCGAGCC-3′)2, and r(5′-GGiCGAiGCC-3′)2 self-comple
mentary duplexes (the 2×2 “GA/GA” internal loop in each duplex is underlined). Here, iG and iC respectively denote isoguanosine and isocytidine, which are derivatives of guanosine and cytidine with transposed amino and carbonyl groups. The NMR structures of these short sequences suggest that the A/G base pairs adopt either imino (cis Watson−Crick/Watson− Crick A/G) or sheared (trans Hoogsteen/Sugar edge A/G) conformations, depending on the identity and orientation of the adjacent (closing) canonical base pairs. Such coupling of the A/G base pair geometry to the sequence and orientation of
the closing base pair is known as the context-dependence of the
structure of the tandem A/G base pairs in internal loops.733,734 This context-dependence has been partly attributed to potential formation of an out-of-plane H-bond involving unpaired
guanine amino group in the imino A/G base pair.106 Thus, a reparameterization of the amino group valence and dihedral
angle parameters was proposed365 in an attempt to mimic
partial sp3 pyramidalization of the free amino group,105 but this did not improve the results obtained. It is likely that the forcefield form did not allow one to make the parameterization of the amino group pyramidalization sufficiently robust, due to its inability to include the electronic structure changes that are coupled with the nonplanarity. The computations were directly compared to benchmark NMR structural data and thermody
namic measurements,734 but the agreement with the experimental results was poor despite the use of advanced
computational methods.365 It is possible that better results would have been obtained using improved force fields, which had become available after the study was conducted (see sections 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.2). However, newer works suggest that the difficulties encountered also reflected general limitations of free-energy computations when applied to nucleobase substitutions (section 3.2.7). Tandem A/G base pairs were further investigated in a later
study, using the χOL3 force field (marked as ff10).743 The
authors considered the r(5′-GCGGACGC-3′)2 duplex with experimentally observed tandem imino A/G base pairs and r(5′-GCGGAUGC-3′)2 structure, which has G/U closing pairs sandwiching two sheared A/G base pairs. They have found that
modification of the nonplanar guanine aminogroup365 improved the simulations of native structures. Alternative (unobserved) A/G base pairing patterns then were constructed, and free-energy differences between imino and sheared conformations were estimated in both sequence contexts using two-dimensional US method (see section 3.2.5); the reaction coordinate was suggested using the nudged elastic
band approach.741 US computations predicted the native A/G pairing patterns to be more stable, although the free-energy difference of ∼0.2 kcal/mol was evidently underestimated. It should be noted that the thermodynamics of RNA folding is difficult to analyze experimentally as well as computationally, and some common assumptions made when analyzing experimental data are oversimplifications. The thermodynamic experiments do not provide an unambiguous decomposition of total free energies into individual energy contributions. There are two fundamental types of interactions between nucleobases whose energetics affect the structure and stability of RNA: base stacking and base pairing. Traditionally, it has been assumed that the sequence dependence of free energies measured in thermodynamic experiments primarily reflects the combined intrinsic strength of base pairing and stacking. If this view is correct, it would ultimately be possible to derive plausible freeenergy models by analyzing the energetics of the direct base pairing and stacking interactions (i.e., dimerization energies between two nucleobases). Nowadays these intrinsic interaction energies can be estimated quite accurately using QM methods, although, to assess the nucleic acids thermodynamics, it would be also necessary to properly consider factors such as
solvent screening of the electrostatic interactions.118,119 However, the above assumption is probably a major oversimplification: it is more likely that the measured free energies result from a very complex mixture of contributions, with base pairing and stacking energies being just part of the overall

energy balance. In addition, the balance may differ from system to system, limiting the transferability of thermodynamic measurements. Measured free energies therefore also include some less salient and more elusive contributions such as those of ion-binding sites and particularly hydration; both stabilizing tightly bound water molecules and destabilizing unsaturated (unsatisfied) H-bond donors/acceptors can be important, as discussed below. These contributions may “overwrite” effects of base stacking and base pairing, making it impossible to identify any systematic correlation between the system’s thermodynamics and its base pairing and stacking interaction energies. It is possible to also obtain thermodynamic parameters from single-molecule pulling experiments, as shown for instance for DNA in ref 744. Although single-molecule experiments are in principle similar to MD simulations experiments, we should recall that they are performed on time scales that are several orders of magnitude slower than those of typical MD simulations. Simulations corresponding to unzipping dynamics using, for instance, steered MD (see section 3.2.5) would not allow realistic thermodynamic parameters to be recovered. However, pulling simulations can be used to qualitatively recover unfolding pathways, as discussed in section 4.3.10. It is also important to take into consideration that free energy of the folded RNA is always measured with respect to the unfolded reference state. For example, in the case of duplex formation, the reference state is the single-stranded state (Figure 19). However, conformation of the unfolded singlestranded RNA is usually unknown; it may exist as a very complex ensemble of diverse structures, and will almost certainly contain some amount of stacking. However, QM interaction energy calculations typically derive stacking energies with respect to noninteracting nucleobases (zero stacking) used
as the reference state.118,119 The structure of the unfolded state can thus influence the kinetics and thermodynamics of folding/ binding. If (for example) a substitution expected to stabilize the folded state stabilizes the unfolded ensemble to a greater degree, the experimental results may be counterintuitive, and the results obtained in typical free-energy simulations may
contradict those observed experimentally.119,745 Difficulties in sampling single-stranded RNAs are exemplified in section 4.1. The extent to which the unfolded state has been properly sampled is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in computational free-energy studies such as TI simulations (section 3.2.7); full sampling of unfolded states is essentially unachievable with current methods. In view of these considerations, it is not surprising that there have been no successful attempts to correlate experimental thermodynamic data with base stacking energies sampled in MD simulations (i.e., evaluations of base−base interaction energies derived from
the force field’s nonbonded terms).742,746 The complexity of molecular interactions is probably one of the factors responsible for so-called non-nearest-neighbor effects, which give rise to substantial coupling (nonadditivity) between diverse mutation sites and can be detected using
double mutant cycle experiments.747 The intricacy of this phenomenon can be visualized by experimental studies that have revealed surprisingly large differences between canonical A-RNA and B-DNA with respect to the free-energy changes that occur upon substituting guanine with inosine (I) in
identical sequence contexts.584,747 This clearly shows that experimental free-energy changes cannot be rationalized using (direct) base pairing and stacking energies, because the GC → IC substitution should have an identical effect on base
pairing and a similar effect on stacking in A-RNA and B-DNA. G → I (and similar) substitution biochemical experiments are commonly used to estimate free energies associated with single H-bonds. However, it can never be guaranteed that the substitution affects only the studied interaction that is abolished. In an ideal case, the GC → IC substitution would cause loss of a single H-bond in both A-RNA and BDNA, so, in the absence of any other factors, one should see near-identical free-energy effects for both helices. This is not
the case in reality.584,747 These experimental findings have been qualitatively reproduced by MD-based TI free-energy simu
lations with the bsc0 and χOL3 AMBER force fields.367 Probably the technically most advanced MD thermodynamics study on duplex free energies was performed to evaluate the free-energy impact of base pair substitution in canonical A
RNA.362 This benchmark study considered only the most conservative mutations from one canonical base pair to another canonical base pair (up to two mutated base pairs in duplexes consisting of six base pairs in total), and excluded purine to pyrimidine exchanges. A smart combination of the FEP thermodynamics cycle method with the Hamiltonian REMD made it possible to achieve improved convergence by performing simulations with different λ-values in parallel with exchanges between neighboring replicas using the Metropolis criterion (see sections 3.2.4, 3.2.6, and 3.2.7). The χOL3 force
field was used, together with impressively long simulation
times. Comparisons with UV melting experiments438 for nine substitutions revealed an amazingly good correlation of ΔΔGcalc
= 1.16(±0.04)ΔΔGexp, with R2 = 0.97 ± 0.01 and a mean absolute deviation of 0.55 kcal/mol. However, for the reasons noted above, it is likely that the accuracy of even this modern procedure would decline sharply if applied to more challenging
substitutions. Experimental data are available438 to test this suggestion. Earlier, ff99 force field has been used to predict relative free energies of RNA helix formation, using three hexaloop hairpins
with identical loops and varying stems.748 The potential of mean force of stretching the hairpins from the native state to an extended conformation was calculated with US (section 3.2.5). The simulations were able to correctly predict order of stabilities of the hairpins, although the magnitude of the freeenergy change was larger than that determined by optical melting experiments. As pointed out by the authors, the unfolded state in the optical melting experiments is a random coil, while the end state in US simulations was an elongated chain, complicating a direct comparison between theory and experiment. Thus, the calculations were compared to reference data by the thermodynamic cycle (section 3.2.7) applied to transitions between hairpins estimated using simulations and nearest-neighbor thermodynamics data. Once more we recall that evaluation of the stability (i.e., full sampling) of the random coil is out of reach for current methods. Some other quite successful free-energy calculations are discussed in sections 4.3.9 and 3.2.7, but it is obvious that, despite occasional optimism in the literature, current MD methods are not generally capable of providing consistently accurate free-energy calculations for RNA internal loops. We would like to emphasize that, despite all limitations, the MD technique does not have any alternative in computational free-energy studies. This is because evaluation of thermodynamic stabilities always requires proper consideration of Boltzmann sampling. Despite common attempts to estimate stabilities of nucleic acids using for example accurate QM

calculations of conformational or interaction energies, such “single-structure” calculations do not reliably reflect free energies. Single-structure calculations just provide “snapshots” at the potential energy surface, while Boltzmann averaging over the potential energy surface is required to get free energies. For a more detailed explanation of how, for example, description of stacking differs in QM, MD, and experimental studies, see refs 118 and 119. To illustrate the overwhelming complexity of the RNA conformational space, the discrete path sampling method identified around 80 000 local minimal on the potential energy surface of the RNA TLs (section 4.2.1) when representing the solvent by an implicit model averaging out solvent degrees of
freedom (section 3.2.8).691
4.3.4. Long-Residency Hydration and Ion-Binding Sites in RNA Motifs. Simulations of the LE motif have also
been instrumental in studies of hydration.484,487 It was suggested a long time ago that hydration makes water an
integral part of RNA’s structure.749 However, while the term “integral part of nucleic acid structure” sounds very appealing, its exact meaning remained somewhat elusive, especially in quantitative terms. X-ray crystallography studies have clearly demonstrated structured hydration of nucleic acid mole
cules.750−755 However, X-ray structures provide only static averaged pictures of hydration, and do not always clearly show which hydration sites are important and which are not. This is partly because the hydration patterns of crystallized nucleic acids may be affected by rigidification of structures in the crystal lattice, to which the inherently dynamic hydration may be sensitive. Additionally, determination of solvent molecules in biomolecular X-ray crystallography is more ambiguous than
that of solute atoms756−760 because the hydration network is affected by subtle biochemically irrelevant differences in crystal packing and the genuine thermal fluctuations of the often
flexible hydration shell.369,756−760 With some exceptions,761 NMR structural experiments typically do not provide any information about hydration. By contrast, MD stands out as a natural and very suitable tool for studying the dynamic aspects
of hydration, and has been used for this purpose almost since it
was first developed.369,484,487,503,522,762−775
Early MD studies strongly supported the hypothesis that hydration of RNA molecules is very dynamic, and this has been confirmed by later studies. The residence (binding) times of individual water molecules (i.e., exchanges between the first hydration shell and the subsequent layers or bulk solvent) in common RNA hydration sites are on the order of 50−500
ps.369,503,769,771 Thus, atomistic MD simulations do not support the idea that rigid spines of hydration and structured water clusters commonly form around nucleic acid molecules. However, a small subset of RNA hydration sites known as long-residency hydration sites may be structured, with longer
binding.369 Even the early LE motif simulations identified longresidency water molecules that remained bound to specific
positions for up to 5 ns.484 Some static long-residency water molecules remained bound for even longer (for the simulation’s
full 25 ns duration) in the LE−L25 protein complex.487 Thus, specific buried waters may help to stabilize protein/RNA
interfaces.369 The repertoire of long-residency hydration sites contains a much greater diversity of structures than just watermediated base pairs and H-bonds (water bridges). The current literature reveals an astonishingly wide variety of hydration sites. Water molecules can bind to RNA at sophisticated hydration sites with coupled water networks or in sites that are entirely buried, long-residence water molecules may “rattle
around” inside a hydration pocket rather than being firmly Hbonded to one donor or acceptor, and water molecules can contribute substantially to the flexibility of an RNA molecule by mediating large-scale movements of adjacent segments via
dynamical water insertion.522 Hydration can also be intimately related to ion binding, and exchanges (competition) between water molecules and monovalent ions are common. MD is the only method able to probe detailed solvent dynamics and identify specific long-residency hydration sites. Unfortunately, despite the existence of highly refined force fields and the ability to perform simulations with time scales that are several orders of magnitude greater than was historically feasible, many modern MD studies neglect hydration analysis, partly because hydration analyses have always been tedious and timeconsuming. It is a pity because descriptions of the structural dynamics of hydration are among the most reliable kinds of data that can be gleaned from MD simulations. Although MD can clearly visualize structured hydration, it is still not clear to what extent tightly bound (long-residency) waters stabilize folded RNAs in terms of free energies. We are not aware of any computational method that can be used to derive the free-energy effects of specific hydration sites, and it is not straightforward to formulate a computational strategy that would subtract the free-energy cost of disrupting a structured hydration network from the overall free-energy balance. Although methods such as grid inhomogeneous solvation
theory (GIST)776,777 might allow the effect of water displacement to be quantified, in the case of RNA folding a full sampling of the unfolded ensemble would be required. It is also not clear how to design a generally applicable computation strategy that would quantify the free-energy contributions of tightly bound waters relative to those of “common” hydration sites. It is quite possible that long-residency water molecules affect only dynamics and not stability. If a given water molecule takes a long time to exchange with the bulk solvent, it is so because the kinetic barrier to exchange is high. Typically, barriers are visited very rarely and do not contribute to the overall partition function of the system. However, a combined biochemical, NMR, and MD simulation study revealed, using serine-to-alanine mutations, a visible free-energy effect of
structured hydration sites in a protein/RNA complex.369 It should be noted that the absence of hydration (i.e., hydration holes) can be as important as visible hydration. Hydration holes occur when the overall disposition of donors and acceptors within a molecule is such that they cannot be efficiently hydrated simultaneously. Such hydration patterns are much harder to identify than conventional hydration sites in MD simulation trajectories because they are inconspicuous. However, they can significantly affect the thermodynamics of RNA motifs by penalizing those conformations in which they occur, due to the presence of unsatisfied H-bond donors and
acceptors.367,584 Their effects can be indirectly visualized (at least in theory) using accurate explicit-solvent MD free-energy methods such as thermodynamics integration (section 3.2.7). Simulations of the LE have also been instrumental in revealing tightly bound and long-residency monovalent ion
binding sites.484−487 Although RNA is a polyanion, the surfaces of RNA molecules do not usually experience any tight binding of monovalent ions. Common ion binding sites including the anionic phosphate groups exhibit occupancies of around 10− 20% for direct (inner-shell) monovalent ion binding, with fast exchange.

monovalent ions to the nonbridging phosphate oxygens does not occur.503,769,771 However, folded RNAs can develop specific ion-binding pockets (the LE deep groove is a textbook example), which are always occupied by cations. Such pockets were later identified in many other RNAs and, like water
binding sites, were shown to be highly variable in terms of their structure and ion residence times; for more details, see section 3.4.1. Finally, simulations of the LE also provided some early insights (despite limitations noted in section 3.4) into the

binding of Mg2+ ions to RNA, specifically to the deep
groove.485,486 These simulations captured long-lived and specific water-mediated interactions between hydrated ions and RNA atoms. It has been suggested that Mg2+ binding specificity is modulated by electrostatic complementarity and structural correspondence between the hydrated ion and its binding pocket. The latter can be estimated by measuring the degree of ion dehydration and the resulting number and
lifetime of intervening water-mediated contacts.486 Significant freezing of tumbling motions of bound Mg2+ ions has been observed. The monovalent and divalent ion binding sites of the LE motif overlap, so water molecules, monovalent ions, and divalent ions compete for the same interaction sites; for more details, see section 3.4.1. For some newer work, see ref 778. Many subsequent MD simulation studies characterized binding of monovalent and divalent ions to RNA molecules. As is also true for hydration sites, there is currently no straightforward procedure for calculating the contribution to the folding free energy associated with individual ion binding sites whose structures are captured in simulations. Whereas in principle it would be possible to compare the computed affinity of the ions for different RNA conformations, one would have to face the challenge of properly sampling the unfolded ensemble to get the differences in folding free energies. Binding of ions to RNA, its effect on RNA structure, and the study of these factors using MD simulations are discussed further in section 3.4.
4.3.5. 5′-UAA/5′-GAN RNA Structural Switch. A striking example of an internal symmetrical 3×3 loop is the 5′-UAA/5′GAN loop, a common and conserved motif occurring in seven ribosomal helices, RNase P, group I and group II introns, and
other RNAs.779 While individual instances of the UAA/GAN internal loop occur in highly variable contexts and are involved in diverse tertiary interactions, most of them adopt a distinctive structure with an unpaired stacked adenine and a bulged nucleotide (N). The three conserved adenines create a characteristic cross-strand AAA stack, although in some cases evolution has found an alternative secondary structure for this loop, as in helix 68 of the E. coli 23S rRNA (Figure 38). Thus, on the basis of the available structural and sequence data for folded RNAs, the 5′-UAA/5′-GAN 3×3 internal loop seems at first sight to have all of the hallmarks of a highly conserved autonomous RNA motif. However, this seeming autonomy was disproved by determination of the solution-phase NMR structure of an isolated UAA/GAA internal loop flanked by
Watson−Crick base pairs,736 which differs markedly from the recurring structure observed in folded RNAs by X-ray crystallography. In isolation, the UAA/GAA pairing is restructured into three consecutive noncanonical base pairs so that there are no unpaired bases. The solution structure, although never seen in crystallographic structures of folded RNAs, is much more consistent with the arrangement expected on the basis of thermodynamic predictions, except that the standard 2D prediction for 5′-UAA/5′-GAA would feature a 2×2 loop with a canonical AU base pair instead of the observed noncanonical A/U base pair. To better understand this system’s behavior, a series of ∼200 ns simulations were performed, supplemented by some enhanced sampling
simulations.737 Even though the simulations were performed with the pre-χOL3 AMBER force fields, they quite convincingly
demonstrated that the characteristic functional structures of 5′UAA/5′-GAA loops extracted from folded RNAs are not structurally stable in isolation; that is, this loop does not seem to be separated from the rest of the ensemble by any significant
free-energy barrier. This RNA element thus functions as a molecular switch that is remodeled by its interactions with the surrounding RNA sequences and proteins. The global minimum of this internal loop as captured by NMR is not known to be biochemically relevant, and the evolutionary pressures acting on it serve to conserve the functional 3D structure embedded in complete functional RNAs. The functional structure can be seen as a minor conformation and is very efficient at forming various tertiary interactions.
4.3.6. Sarcin−Ricin Loop as a Stiff RNA Motif. The SRL motif occurs in many different contexts and folds autonomously
(Figure 37).56,528−530,705 It can be found inside large RNAs and on their surfaces, and may exist as an internal loop within a helix or a component of a complex multihelix junction. It is usually formed at the level of 2D structure, that is, as a local internal loop formed by noncanonical base pairing of two strands. However, there are also composite SRL motifs involving more than two strands, which cannot be inferred from 2D structures. SRLs probably fulfill a variety of functions. The first SRL motif to be discovered is located in helix 95 in domain VI of the large ribosomal subunit. Together with an adjacent GAGA TL (section 4.2), it comprises one of the most conserved sequences of the ribosome, the sarcin−ricin domain
(SRD).780 The name derives from the toxins sarcin and ricin, which cleave the phosphodiester backbone at a specific position in the TL and depurinate the adenine stacked at the top of the
TL.781−785 The SRD forms part of the binding site for
elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G (in bacteria).786 Disruption of the SRD by ribotoxins or deletion of SRD are lethal because they disable the binding of elongation factors to the ribosome
and cause its inactivation.787−789 There are multiple other SRLs in the ribosome, which are typically conserved across all three kingdoms of life. Multiple X-ray structures featuring SRL motifs are available, including examples located in ribosomes and
riboswitches.790−792 There are also high-resolution atomic
structures of isolated SRL motifs.528,716,793,794 The SRL motif always includes a universally conserved 5′GUA/5′-GA miniduplex that incorporates a GpU dinucleotide platform (Figure 37). Below the miniduplex, there is a more sequence-variable segment that usually consists of two noncanonical base pairs. The G residue of the platform is bulged, and the 5′-GUA/5′-GA miniduplex is stabilized by an unprecedented network of 13 H-bonds supplemented by
extensive stacking.717,718 A characteristic feature of SRL motifs is the S-turn conformation of the backbone around the bulged
G,795 which reverses the chain direction in the flexible region and then restores it in the G-bulge region; this feature is referred to as the “double flip over”. The preceding adenine is said to be in a “3′-5′ like” arrangement (Figure 37). The SRL backbone features several unusual backbone dihedral angles. Because of its importance and ubiquity, SRL has been the
subject of several MD simulation and QM studies.86,530,705 MD simulations have shown that it is one of the stiffest RNA building blocks and exhibits less pronounced thermal
fluctuations than most RNA sequences.530 It has been suggested that the stiffness of the SRL motif is important for its biochemical roles. Its so-called flexible region, which contains base pairs whose interactions would be expected to
be quite weak, is stiffened by base−phosphate interactions50
and S-turn backbone topology.795 The SRL may be associated with simple water bridges, but it has no obvious ion binding
site.530 Superficially, the SRL motif is nicely stable in MD simulations. However, this first impression is misleading

because current force fields still do not reproduce important details of its unique backbone topology and the H-bond
network around the G-bulge region.705 The molecule appears very stable in MD simulations because it is firmly locked in its native conformation, while alternative or spurious structures are separated from the native basin by large free-energy barriers. It is unlikely that SRL would fold spontaneously from the unfolded state in MD simulations using current force fields.
QM calculations86,718 have shown that the different structural features of SRL give rise to a very complex energetic balance
that is unlikely to be well-described by force fields.132,705 SRL motif is thus an important benchmark for parameterization and verification of force fields, and especially for the reparameterization of dihedral potentials. It should be included in the standard portfolio of test targets for RNA force fields because of its uniqueness and the availability of unambiguous structural data. Despite the limitations of current force fields, MD simulations with a modest time scale of 200 ns have been successfully used to rank relative structural stabilities of
different SRL motif sequence variants.705 More specifically, MD predicted the impact of substitutions on SHAPE
probing796 data better than a bioinformatics scoring scheme based on isostericity.
4.3.7. Kink-Turns and Reverse Kink-Turns as Potential Molecular Elbows. Kink-turn is an asymmetric internal loop that adopts a unique V-shaped topology in its folded state
(Figure 39).55,282,507,521,522,797−808 Both local kink-turns and composites consisting of more than two strands have been
observed.55 Kink-turns consist of three distinct subsegments: a noncanonical (NC) stem composed of noncanonical base pairs, a canonical (C) stem with canonical base pairs, and a usually three-nucleotide bulge between the stems in the longer strand of the asymmetric internal loop. Each of these three segments contains characteristic base pairs and tertiary interactions that
cause the kink-turn to adopt a specific functional fold with a sharp bend in the phosphodiester backbone in the bulge region, where the interstem angle is ∼120°. Kink-turns play a key role
in protein-assisted RNA folding.521 In addition, structural analyses, MD simulations, and cryo-EM data suggest that some kink-turns may contribute to the functional dynamics of
RNA.522,802,805,806,809 Kink-turns are stabilized by a set of five signature interactions: a canonical (usually GC) base pair at
the first position in the C-stem, tandem tHS39 “sheared” AG base pairs with opposing polarities at the first and second positions of the NC-stem, and two tertiary tSS interactions. The first of these tSS interactions occurs between the 5′-end nucleotide of the bulge and the adenine of the first tHS pair of the NC-stem, and includes a 2′-OH−A(N1) H-bond that is the
most important interaction for folding of a kink-turn.55,801 The second tertiary contact connects the NC and C-stems, and is formed between adenine in the second NC-stem’s tHS pair and the first C-stem canonical pair. The second tertiary contact is a
common A-minor interaction.810 Formation of the sharply bent (folded) kink-turn structure requires the presence of divalent
cations or binding proteins.523,524 Kink-turns have been examined in several MD studies, which have investigated their flexibility, hydration, ion-binding,
sequence properties, and protein binding.282,507,522,603,802−808 These studies generally showed that kink-turns are well described by the AMBER force fields, which nicely capture their complex topology. The only known force-field issue is that it tends to predict that the key apical 2′-OH−A(N1) tertiary Hbond fluctuates between the native state and an alternative configuration in which the adenine amino group acts as the hydrogen-bond donor (Figure 39), which does not seem to be
supported by any experimental data.507 This force field’s good performance is somewhat surprising given the uniqueness of the kink-turn topology; it may be due
Figure 39. Annotated 2D39 and 3D structures of a typical kink-turn.521 Its essential components include a three-nucleotide bulge, an adenine-specific
sugar/base interaction (green inset), and an A-minor interaction (purple inset).810 MD simulations have revealed that kink-turns may act as flexible
anisotropic and nonharmonic molecular hinges (black inset).522 This motion is significantly aided by reversible insertions of water molecules
between O2′···O2′ atoms in the A-minor interaction (smaller purple inset).522 On the other hand, alternative conformation of the bulge signature
interaction, commonly observed in MD simulations (smaller green inset), is most likely a force-field error.507 For more details, see the text. Adapted with permission from ref 176. Copyright 2014 American Chemical Society.

to the overall looseness of the kink-turn structure, in which the individual interactions do not act in opposition to each other. Therefore, modest inaccuracies in the force field’s description of individual backbone elements’ conformations, H-bonding, stacking, and solvation features do not amplify each other and are tolerated within the overall structure. For additional discussion of compensation of errors in networks of H-bonds, see the analysis of force-field performance for protein/RNA complexes (section 4.7.1). Interestingly, MD simulations did not reveal any obvious ion
binding sites around kink-turns.603 This seems inconsistent with experimental findings, which clearly show that kink-turns are among the most divalent-ion-dependent RNA motifs. The contradiction probably stems from the intuitive assumption that tight structural ion binding and ion-dependent RNA behavior must always be directly related. However, there is no a priori physical requirement for prominent ion-dependence in RNA folding to always be due to tightly bound ions (or vice versa). Contemporary MD methods can reliably identify major ionbinding sites around RNA motifs, so if such a site existed in kink-turns, it would be detected. In fact, no experimental study has provided evidence of structural ion-binding in kink-turns. This shows that structural data alone are not sufficient to confidently predict the ion-dependency of RNA folding. In the case of kink-turns, nonspecific ion atmosphere screening is probably needed to stabilize tightly kinked structures in the kink-turn ensemble, which then allows formation of the motif’s signature interactions. The remarkable ion-dependence of kinkturn folding clearly warrants further study using MD techniques. MD simulations have revealed that kink-turns are exceptionally flexible elements that look like hinges and can act as passive molecular elbows that facilitate large-scale dynamical move
ments in larger RNAs.522,603,802,805,806 By “passive elbows” we mean structures that permit fast barrier-free movements but do not drive them. Kink-turn flexibility is highly anisotropic and stems from the apex of the kink, while the attached arms are more rigid. The A-minor interaction between C- and NC-stems fluctuates between direct and water-mediated conformations
(Figure 39).522 In the water-mediated conformation, the distance between sugar−phosphate backbones entering the two stems of the V-shaped RNA is increased, causing an increase in the interstem angle. In this way, local fluctuations in the system’s hydration contribute to the global flexibility of the RNA motif. The kink-turn is thus a unique hinge-like RNA element with high anisotropic flexibility. Because MD simulations indicate that its water insertion-expulsion dynamics occur on a time scale of nanoseconds, we suggest that the kinkturn elbow should be described as a floppy system with a single shallow (flat) nonharmonic free-energy minimum rather than a system that alternates between direct-binding and water
mediated substates.522 Ribosomal X-ray structures show both water-mediated and direct H-bond variants of the A-minor
interaction in kink-turns.522 Importantly, solution-phase experiments have been unable to capture the kinked structure at atomic resolution because isolated kink-turn sequences tend to
unfold.811 These results show how MD simulations can complement experimental studies: we are unaware of any experimental method that could have revealed the unique flexibility of the folded kink-turn, or shed light on the relationship between this flexibility and the system’s hydration dynamics.
It is important to note that MD simulations, solution structural experiments, and X-ray crystallography are mutually nonequivalent techniques that complement each other. Although MD studies examine isolated kink-turns in simulated solution-phase environments, they are not equivalent to solution experiments. MD primarily provides information on the physicochemical properties of folded kink-turns because the starting structures used in simulations are taken from functional conformations seen in X-ray structures of ribosomes, and they do not unfold on the simulations’ time scale. In this case, one can take full advantage of the essentially unlimited temporal resolution of the MD technique, which allows one to directly visualize the large-scale thermal fluctuations. One can study intrinsic properties of the folded conformational subensemble for a sufficiently long time without being limited by the context of any surrounding molecules. Simulations of this sort help explain how the intrinsic flexibility of folded kink-turns is
experienced and exploited by surrounding proteins and RNAs
in the ribosome.522,603,802,805,806
A prominent and potentially flexible kink-turn 42 is located at the bottom of helix 42 in the helix 42−helix 44 (H42−H44) part of the large ribosomal subunit. This large RNA segment, which is also known as the GTPase-associated center (GAC) rRNA, moves during the elongation cycle. In the available ribosomal X-ray structures, the GAC region (also known as L11 or L7/L12 stalk or protuberance) adopts a set of “inward” and “outward” geometries with respect to the A-site of the large
ribosomal subunit.9 Its movement controls the position of the upper part (“head”) of the H42−H44 rRNA relative to the body of large ribosomal subunit. Unfortunately, resolution of the available X-ray structures does not permit unambiguous determination of the exact source of observed mobility of the GAC RNA. In addition, X-ray structures may only capture part of the full system’s flexibility, because the X-ray structures basically show it in random positions with different crystal packing arrangements. Consequently, different researchers have interpreted the available data differently. The observed flexibility of H42−H44 has been attributed to several factors, including: (i) hinge-like behavior and twisting flexibility of kinkturn 42, which was observed in MD simulations and coincides
with the observed path of H42−H44 bending;522 (ii) common A-RNA twisting flexibility of the lower part of H42, that is, the
kink-turn C-stem;10 and (iii) flexibility of noncanonical base
pairs and RNA interactions at the base of H42.9 However, the natural flexibility of kink-turn 42 and the other suggested movements can be suppressed by a tertiary interaction with a conserved guanine from helix 97, which is inserted into the NC-stem of the kink-turn between the “head” of the whole structure and the kink-turn. On the basis of the presence of this interaction, a newer MD study suggested that the observed flexibility might be best explained by directional flexibility of the type C three-way junction between helices 42, 43, and 44 above
the kink-turn.431 This junction’s flexibility is anisotropic and spreads over multiple nucleotides (i.e., there is no easily identifiable hinge point), and coincides with the observed path. It has also been suggested that kink-turn 38, which is located at the base of helix 38 (also known as the A-site finger), may
enable dynamic behavior of this helix.806 Helix 38 is the longest (110 Å) helix of the large subunit, and connects to the small
subunit via dynamic intersubunit bridge B1a.812−815 Cryo-EM studies revealed that the tip of H38 moves by more than 10 Å as the ribosome transitions from the ratcheted to nonratcheted
state (Figure 40).816,817 Mutational studies suggested that the

flexible H38 plays a central role in attenuating translocation and
dynamic signaling between ribosomal functional centers.818−822 Intrinsic flexibility of kink-turn 38, which forms an elbow-like segment within helix 38, would nicely support the movements suggested by cryo-EM, although the experiments do not permit exact localization of the movement’s origin. The elbow element could facilitate fast barrierless relocations of the entirety of helix 38 (Figure 40). However, the archaeal kink-turn 38 is not conserved in bacteria, which (as demonstrated by the examples of E. coli, T. thermophilus, and D. radiodurans) possess diverse and seemingly unrelated RNA elements in the positions
corresponding to that of kink-turn 38.806 There appears to be absolutely no conservation at the level of sequence or secondary structure within the bacteria kingdom, or between
bacteria and archaea.806 This is at first sight inconsistent with any putative functional significance of the elbow segment of helix 38. Strikingly, despite their complete lack of sequence similarity, all of these H38 segments ultimately fold into remarkably similar overall shapes (as demonstrated by structural data) and have similar levels of directional flexibility that closely mirror those of a kink-turn system (as
demonstrated by MD simulation results).806 Thus, important physical properties of RNA molecules (i.e., their overall topology and directional flexibility) can sometimes be conserved even in the absence of any conservation of not only in the sequence data but also of isostericity. One possible explanation for this in case of the elbow-like segment of helix 38 is that the ribosome merely requires the presence of an RNA sequence that is sufficiently amenable to bending into the required direction. Alternatively, it is possible that the sequence differences between the species reflect some fine-tuning of H38 elbow segment’s properties. There are presently no data that could be used to say which of these scenarios is most plausible; this ambiguity illustrates the complexity of studying functional flexibility of rRNAs. The yeast ribosome has a similar topology
around the H38 elbow segment,11 suggesting that the topology of this segment is also conserved in eukaryotes. Bioinformatics analysis of available structural data on flexible elements of the large ribosomal subunit suggested that pivoting positions for movements in the large subunit are typically associated with structurally weak motifs such as noncanonical pairs (primarily G/U wobble base pairs), bulge loops, and
three-way junctions.823 This indicates that RNA flexibility can be spread over multiple nucleotides rather than being associated with localized hinges. Such smooth distributions of flexibilities of (along) the molecules do not rely on highly specialized RNA motifs and may thus be more evolutionarily robust than those that do. This is consistent with several MD
studies.431,824 However, given the limited resolutions and inherently averaged nature of available experimental structures, further research into the distribution and properties of flexible elements in ribosome is needed. MD simulations are natural tools for studying flexible RNA elements. However, although simulations of isolated RNA elements such as those described above can identify the intrinsic flexibility of different RNA building blocks, they cannot be used to directly study coupling of those building blocks with their broader structural contexts inside the ribosome. Therefore, interpretations of such simulations may be ambiguous. More complete analysis of ribosome flexibility would require atomistic simulations of the whole ribosome, which, however, do not provide the accuracy required to understand its flexibility in detail, for a variety of reasons explained in section 4.6. The crystal structure of the helix−loop−helix of the Azoarcus group I intron shows another bent RNA building block that superficially resembles the kink-turn consensus. However, this building block bends in the opposite direction; that is, it is kinked toward the major grooves of flanking helices. Additionally, there are no significant tertiary interactions between its
stems. This structure has been named the reverse kink-turn,825

and has been characterized by extensive MD simulations.604 The simulations supported the view that reverse kink-turn is, despite some sequence similarity, unrelated to true kink-turns. This study was one of the first microsecond-scale MD works on nucleic acids, and tested several different RNA force fields, ion conditions, and water models. It clearly demonstrated the necessity of using an RNA force field with a proper treatment
of the χ dihedral potential, such as χOL3.94 It also showed that simulations of some RNAs are sensitive to the choice of water model. The simulations were used to characterize the directional intrinsic flexibility of reverse kink-turn pertinent to its folded functional geometries, leading to the conclusion that it was the most flexible RNA motif studied to date using explicit solvent simulations. The simulated reverse kink-turns spontaneously and reversibly sampled many geometries, ranging from tightly kinked to flexible intermediates and extended unkinked structures. MD thus confirmed that, similarly to the 5′-UAA/5′GAN internal loop (section 4.3.5), the native reverse kink-turn structure is primarily imposed by the surrounding context. Consequently, the reverse kink-turn is not an autonomous
RNA motif. Conservation of the tHH A/A base pair that terminates the NC-stem with a flipped adenine is thus a consequence of the evolutionarily conserved outlying tertiary RNA−RNA interactions that determine the direction of the reverse kink-turn’s bend. Reverse kink-turn topology is not compatible with the tHS A/G base pair characteristic of conventional kink-turns, suggesting these two RNAs are evolutionarily unrelated. Additionally, kink-turns are common
but reverse kink-turns are quite rare.826
4.3.8. Depicting RNA Dynamics Using NMR and MD Data: The TAR RNA Element. The current understanding of RNA structures is primarily based on X-ray crystallography data. This means that our knowledge is inherently biased in favor of RNAs that fold into well-defined functional structures observed in X-ray experiments. However, many RNAs are inherently dynamic and in extreme cases may be unstructured like intrinsically disordered proteins. Therefore, to understand the behavior of many RNAs, it is necessary to move beyond static structures by describing their dynamic ensembles, preferably at atomic resolution. Unfortunately, the amount of

experimentally observable data is typically much smaller than the number of parameters that would be needed to capture the structures and populations of even just the most important conformers that define the free-energy landscape. Problems of this sort are best addressed by analyses that combine experiments with advanced MD simulations. One of the best methods for studying RNA dynamics in solutions is NMR, although it is fair to note that, for several reasons, the dynamics of RNA are much more difficult to study by NMR than are those of proteins. One of the reasons is low density of hydrogens along the nucleic acids backbone. In addition, most proteins are more “globular” than RNA molecules, which reduces robustness of structural determination methods based on NOEs. An important model system for studying RNA dynamics and finding ways to link NMR and MD descriptions is the HIV
trans-activation response (TAR) element.62,303,346,630,827−841 TAR is a 59-nucleotide RNA hairpin essential for transactivation of the viral promoter and viral replication (Figure 41). Although the TAR RNA has a defined secondary structure, it is a rather dynamic molecule. Its binding to the Tat protein is essential for activation of the long terminal repeat
promoter.62,833,838,840 The TAR RNA hairpin became one of the most studied RNAs due to its profound flexibility and
potential as a target for antiviral therapy.838 The available experimental data on TAR RNA are primarily derived from solution-phase experiments, but its size and flexibility have made it impossible to obtain a high-resolution structure of the complete TAR element. NMR experiments have provided some
information on the properties of the apo form of the TAR,62,837 but most studies have focused on its molecular complexes with
cyclic oligopeptides.346,630,833,835,837,839,840 These peptides mostly recognize the U23C24U25 internal bulge and the
sequences in its vicinity,346,630,833,835,837,840 but they may also
interact with the apical (N30-N35) hairpin (Figure 41).835,839 In addition to structural insights obtained from various NMR experiments, analyses of primary NMR data on the TAR have yielded unique indirect information about its dynam
ics.827,831,832,842 Space limits make it impossible to discuss these analyses comprehensively here. However, the data indicate that the TAR RNA is an archetype of a class of RNA molecules that cannot be satisfactorily represented by a single structure. While the apo structure has a large kink between its stems, the binding of the Tat protein is associated with a conformational change that produces a straight structure with coaxial helix stacking. Two potential mechanisms of action for antiviral compounds targeting the TAR element are direct inhibition of the TAR−Tat interaction and suppression of this conformational change. In terms of its dynamics, the molecule can be divided into four segments: the upper and lower stem, the bulge between them, and the apical loop (Figure 41). The segment whose dynamics are believed to be most biochemically important is the bulge region, which functions as a molecular hinge permitting variation of the angle between the two stems. The interstem angles suggested for various TAR solution structures range approximately from 70° to 130°, although one must always treat quantitative structure determinations based on NMR experiments with some caution. Most studies consider the stems to be essentially rigid segments, although A-RNA helices are definitely not inflexible (section 4.3.9). To describe the dynamics of the stems and to interpret key residual dipolar coupling (RDC) NMR data, a model based on three
interhelical Euler angles has been suggested.836 In some studies, the helical stems were extended with additional base pairs (3− 22) to obtain additional independent sets of RDCs and thereby improve the overall resolution of the NMR experi
ment.173,668,836,842 RDC data are sensitive to submillisecondscale dynamics, although they cannot be used to directly determine the time scale of a given dynamic process. Information on slow modes of conformational dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale related to the presence of minor conformations (conformational “excited states”), which simultaneously remodel the structure of the bulge, stem, and apical loop, has been obtained using other
NMR methods843 including measurements resolving sugar
pucker conformation and slow modes of sugar repuckering.844 It is to be noted that the apical hexaloop was in many abovedescribed experiments replaced by the more stable UUCG tetraloop. Natural flexibility of the TAR RNA limits the usefulness of Xray crystallography; although a 1.3 Å resolution X-ray structure
of a 27-nt model of the TAR bulge exists,834 it is considered biochemically irrelevant because the flexible UCU bulge, which is important for molecular recognition, is immobilized by innershell binding of Ca2+ to all its phosphates. The structure is inconsistent with solution-phase data. However, even structures determined by conventional NMR experiments are unlikely to be fully representative because such experiments necessarily yield static, averaged models. The resulting PDB files indeed depict sets of structures compatible with the averaged NMR data rather than the true dynamic ensemble that is present in solution. To properly understand the structure and dynamics of TAR RNA, it will therefore be necessary to combine MD simulations with data from dynamic NMR experiments such as
RDCs, as reviewed for proteins.845 The apo and holo forms of the TAR RNA have been studied
extensively using MD.303,346,827−832,841,842 In addition to
conventional MD simulations, enhanced sampling303,346,828 and Monte Carlo simulations of constrained (rigid) frag
ments828 have been performed. Different groups have studied these systems using either the CHARMM or AMBER RNA force fields. Two studies reported extended simulations of TAR RNA and presented detailed comparisons of their simulated
results to primary NMR data.831,842 The first study842 accumulated an 8.2 μs CHARMM36 trajectory using the
Anton supercomputer.73 Because of the huge amount of data generated in this trajectory, 10 000 snapshots were collected at 820 ps intervals. This interval between snapshots is noteworthy because just two decades ago, 820 ps would have been a respectable duration for a complete MD simulation trajectory. Such “coarse graining of the temporal resolution” of MD trajectories is becoming common or even unavoidable when processing long MD runs. However, it can lead to losses of useful information, for instance, when it is necessary to carefully follow a series of rearrangements to understand the origins of
force-field imbalances133 or to describe fast structural transitions. This time-resolution would definitely preclude analysis of dynamical hydration. The impressive 8.2 μs CHARMM36 simulation achieved a somewhat better agreement with the measured RDCs than an earlier set of 80 ns
CHARMM27 simulations.841 This may reflect improvements in both sampling and force-field parameters. However, discrepancy between the calculated and measured RDCs remained appreciably larger than the RDC measurement uncertainty.

A considerably better agreement was achieved by processing the original MD ensemble using a Monte Carlo-based selection approach to extract a subset of MD-sampled structures that minimize the difference between measured and computed data. The resulting RDC-selected (sub)ensembles are assumed to better represent the atomistic dynamics of the real molecules because they integrate information from both MD and
NMR.842 Notably, an analysis of the sampled interhelical angles showed that many conformers in the RDC-selected ensemble occupied sparsely populated regions of the raw MD simulation trajectory. The RDC-selected ensemble exhibited, among other features, significantly larger bend angles between the helices than the raw MD simulation ensemble, and confirmed the occurrence of previously predicted largeamplitude bending and twisting motions. Although the above-described sampling and selection procedure is a valid and potentially powerful way to correct the deficiencies of MD simulation trajectories, limited resolution of the experimental data may lead to “overselection”. This could cause population of unrealistic local structural features if a large force-field inaccuracy is the primary source of discrepancies between MD and primary NMR data. The RDC-selected ensemble suggested local dynamics in the bulge region (and its vicinity) involving rearrangements of stacking and H-bonding. These local dynamics, which are not detectable using traditional NMR techniques, may drive global changes in interhelical orientation, with transitions dominated by motions occurring on nanosecond-to-microsecond time scales. This relationship between local dynamics and global flexibility resembles the mechanism of flexibility suggested for
kink-turns522,805 (section 4.3.7). Such motions are detectable by analyzing RDCs but not spin relaxation data. The MD trajectory was also compared to NMR data using the maximum occurrence (MaxOcc) method, which analyzes averaged experimental RDCs by weighting contributions of a set of
sterically allowed conformations.832 A series of 1 μs AMBER bsc0 simulations of the isolated TAR using starting structures taken from various NMR studies on apo and holo TAR variants were performed to re-evaluate the conformational selection hypothesis of TAR-ligand
recognition.831 The predicted unbiased structural dynamics
were verified by comparison to the available RDCs,846 order
parameter (S2) values,830 and NMR structural data. In contrast to earlier simulation studies, including those with the
CHARMM36 force field,842 previously measured RDCs and order parameters were quantitatively reproduced. However, it should be noted that the reported direct comparison of the data from the two studies was based primarily on a visual assessment of a fraction of the RDC data set (cf., Figures S2 and S19 in refs 842 and 831, respectively). The bsc0 simulations confirmed that the TAR RNA undergoes a very rich set of dynamic processes occurring on time scales of nanoseconds to microseconds (the latter matching the duration of the simulations). Further analyses led to the suggestion that dynamics relevant to ligand binding may occur on a nearmicrosecond time scale. This suggestion appears to be consistent with the apparently central role of the stochastic hinge-bending motion of TAR, which occurs on a time scale of hundreds of nanoseconds. This bending motion is believed to induce conformations that facilitate Tat protein binding, as
discussed by the authors in the context of the NMR data.831 Because the relevant dynamics occur on time scales comparable to those of the simulations, it would be useful to perform much
longer simulations with the χOL3 force field (unpublished simulations using bsc0 conducted by some of us show that the collapse of the TAR RNA into a ladder-like structure might occur on submicrosecond time scales). The MD analysis suggested a visible coordination of the motions of the bulge and
of the apical loop.831 Because this very interesting observation is somewhat counterintuitive, it also merits further study by more extended simulations. Despite evidence that the discrepancy between the raw MD
CHARMM36 trajectory842 and the experimental data for the TAR RNA arose primarily from differences in the description of global interhelical dynamics (good agreement was reported for backbone angles, pucker, and base-pair parameters), its physical
origin could not be determined.847 Thus, as part of their longrunning effort to use NMR data and MD simulations to unravel
RNA dynamics,848 the group responsible for the CHARMM study shifted their focus to characterization of structural dynamics of the apical loop. In particular, they considered a UUCG-capped TAR sequence. They simulated this system
using the χOL3 AMBER force field instead of CHARMM.849 The MD-generated ensemble qualitatively reproduced the measured RDCs, but the selection of a subensemble was required for quantitative reproduction. The largest discrepancies between the RDC-selected and MD-generated ensembles were observed for the most flexible TL residues and backbone angles connecting the TL to the helix, with the RDCselected ensemble yielding more uniform predicted dynamics. A comparison of the RDC-selected ensemble to NMR spin relaxation data suggested that the dynamics occurred on time scales of picosecond−nanosecond, which was verified by analyzing relaxation dispersion data. The RDC-satisfying ensemble sampled some conformations adopted by the hairpin in crystal structures, indicating that intrinsic plasticity may play important roles in conformational adaptation. The approach used in this work would be very useful for development and back-verification of force fields, especially if similar data were obtained for other RNA motifs. However, when looking into the actual data in the paper, the reported geometrical variations of the TL appear rather subtle. For more discussion of the structural conservation of UNCG TLs, see section 4.2. In our opinion, the results obtained in this work are consistent with earlier analyses showing that the χOL3 force field provides an improved description of UNCG TLs, but still has many
flaws,129,139,163 as discussed in sections 4.2.2.3 and 4.2.2.4. MD simulations have also been used to study the binding of
a short cyclic peptide to the TAR RNA.303 The peptide was
designed to mimic Tat, and an NMR structure839 of the complex has been determined. The authors used steered MD simulations to bring the peptide close to TAR and vice versa. The “steered variable” was the net electrostatic interaction between the two molecules, which was computed using the Debye−Hückel approximation (section 3.2.5). This made it possible to drive the positively charged peptide toward the most negative region of TAR. Remarkably, these simulations predictively found the correct binding site. However, they also identified a second binding pose that was more stable than the one that matched the experimental data. This suggested that the protocol was not robust enough to distinguish between the two poses. Additionally, the authors combined forward and backward simulations to obtain absolute binding affinities, which proved to be significantly greater than those observed experimentally. Two possible reasons for this have been suggested: (a) the force field might be not accurate enough

to describe these strong electrostatic interactions, or (b) the simulations may have been too short and failed to properly sample the full free-state of TAR. The latter problem would lead to an underestimation of entropy in the unbound state and thus an overestimation of the complex’s stability. This interpretation is also consistent with the typical time scales required to sample the free state discussed in the studies commented above. Interesting insights into the principles governing TAR-Tat binding were obtained by analyzing the first high-resolution structure of an intermediate in the binding of TAR RNA to a cyclic peptide designed to mimic the binding of Tat while
having a greater affinity for TAR.346 The intermediate’s structure was constructed by combining sophisticated NMR measurements with enhanced sampling MD simulations. The simulations were done with the χOL3 force field, which was
modified using measured RDC restraints, and utilized replica
averaged metadynamics (RAM, section 3.2.6).345 Results were verified by comparison to a number of independent NMR parameters, which were more accurately reproduced by the RAM ensemble than by the standard MD ensemble or the static experimental structure. The suggested binding intermediate was used to identify two mutants that were expected to affect interactions present in the intermediate complex but absent in the ground state. The predicted effects of these mutations were then confirmed by surface plasmon resonance kinetic experiments. The authors subsequently used the RAM methodology with RDC data to study a 14 nt RNA hairpin containing the UUCG
TL.347 This study suggested that the UUCG TL exhibits rich dynamics and identified multiple substates that exist in equilibrium due to thermal fluctuations. However, in our opinion, the reported structural flexibility of the UUCG TL is somewhat counterintuitive (see section 4.2). We cannot exclude the possibility that the method may face some resolution limits, that could distort the balance between the RDC measurements and the force-field model, which is well
known to be far from being flawless for the UUCG
TL.129,139,163
In summary, visualization of the TAR-Tat binding inter
mediate346 is a textbook example of the emerging synergy between solution-phase experiments and modern MD simulations using powerful computers, improved force fields, and smart enhanced sampling methods. However, despite the potential of these synergies and the tremendous work done on the TAR RNA and the UNCG TL, the studies discussed above also show that obtaining unambiguous atomic-resolution insights into RNA dynamics using combined NMR and MD tools remains far from routine. The UNCG TL is in fact often assumed to be one of the stiffest RNA motifs, and to lack substantial dynamics! Therefore, it remains to be seen if it is possible to develop methods that would be capable of studying truly dynamical RNA molecules rearranging their 3D and 2D structures during their thermal dynamics. 4.3.9. Canonical A-RNA. The MD literature relating to DNA is dominated by studies on canonical B-DNA. This is not the case for the RNA simulation literature because of the different biochemical roles of canonical helices in folded RNAs, although A-RNA flexibility may be relevant in systems such as RNA-based nanostructures and double-stranded viral ge
nomes.850 Nevertheless, studies of canonical A-RNA are useful and are also important for benchmarking simulation methods. If one uses a stable simulation force field that does not cause
substantial A-RNA degradation (either massive fraying or formation of ladder-like structures; see section 3.1.2.1 and Figures 7 and 8), canonical A-RNA simulations converge well
within a few hundred nanoseconds.137 This is because A-RNA simulations lack any alternative backbone substates that could retard convergence, in contrast to the B-DNA BI/BII
substates.115,146,149,851,852 We recall that this sort of convergence should be considered as a local one, and that there is no publication so far showing predictive hybridization of an ARNA helix, which, with current force fields, may still not be the global free-energy minimum (see section 3.2.1). Sequence-dependent local conformational variability is a key property of B-DNA. Because purely canonical helices in folded RNAs are short and canonical A-RNA variability is marginal as compared to variability of noncanonical RNA regions, it is not clear whether A-RNA sequence-dependent variability has any biochemical relevance. Nevertheless, MD simulation studies have been conducted to investigate this in A-RNA, revealing
interesting sequence-dependent properties of A-RNA helices137
that superficially resemble the variability of B-DNA.851,853,854 The inclination of simulated A-RNA duplexes varied from 10° to 24°, and their major groove widths also exhibited substantial
variability.137 On the basis of simulations of sequences with modified bases (inosine and 2,6-diaminopurine), the calculations suggested that sequence-dependence of purely canonical A-RNA double helix is due to the steric shape of base pairs, that
is, their vdW interactions.137 The electrostatic component of stacking does not appear to affect the A-RNA shape. Especially visible is the role of minor groove amino group of purines. This is broadly consistent with the so-called Dickerson−Calladine mechanical rules suggested three decades ago for DNA double
helices.853,854 The simulations revealed that A-RNA helices are easily deformable in the direction of the inclination/groove width space. Another variable parameter is base pair roll, which is mathematically directly coupled to inclination through helical twist (i.e., the inclination and base pair roll are mutually corresponding helical parameters that are defined in the global
and local coordination frames, respectively).855,856 Thus, ARNA can smoothly move between low and high inclination
conformations on the basis of its environment.137 It is surprisingly difficult to compare these simulation results
to experimental data.137,857 The available A-RNA oligonucleotide X-ray structures are usually very short, affected by crystal packing, and often contain at least one noncanonical base pair. A-RNA helices in the ribosome are also very short, and their major groove widths show high variability with no apparent sequence-dependence. In other words, experimentally observed A-RNA groove widths may be affected by their environments, including the presence of partner molecules in the ribosome and crystal packing in the case of oligonucleotide X-ray structures. The only sequence effect that unambiguously emerges from experiments is a pronounced alternation of
base pair roll in alternating −AU− sequences.858 This is caused by balance of intrastrand and interstrand stacking in these
sequences,855,856 and is well reproduced in MD simulations.137 It was also pointed out that given the substantial thermal fluctuations of the groove width seen in the simulations, it is not clear that the groove width can be adequately represented
by a single static distance.137 Another study attempted to understand the effect of crystal packing on observed structures of canonical A-RNA by performing simulations of the alternating r(UU(AU)6AA)2 A

of eight unit cells each containing four copies of the duplex,
with an aggregate of 16 μs of data per duplex.859 In principle, such simulations could be used to understand effects of crystal packing on A-RNA helices seen in different X-ray structures. The simulated A-RNA structure conformed more closely to the average structure seen in the crystals than to structures extracted from a solution simulation with the same force field. However, the integrity of the crystal lattice degraded slowly as the simulations progressed, causing growing
heterogeneity at the interfaces between the chains.859
The flexibility of A-RNA has also been investigated,860,861 using computational approaches similar to those developed to
study B-DNA.862−864 A-RNA and B-DNA actually have similar flexibilities, with comparable bending, twisting, and stretching
deformabilities.865 However, experiments with single-molecule magnetic tweezers revealed a striking qualitative difference between these canonical forms in that the twist-stretch coupling
in A-RNA has the opposite sign to that of B-DNA.866 dsRNA has a force-torque phase diagram similar to that of dsDNA, including plectoneme formation, melting of the double helix induced by torque, a highly overwound state, and a highly under-wound left-handed state. However, unlike dsDNA, dsRNA shortens upon overwinding, and its characteristic transition rate at the plectonemic buckling transition is 2
orders of magnitude slower than for dsDNA.866 These observations were not explainable using existing models of nucleic acid double helix elasticities. The discrepancy was
addressed in a subsequent MD simulation study:860 unconstrained MD simulations on 16-base pair duplexes with modern force fields broadly reproduced the qualitatively different twiststretch couplings for dsDNA and dsRNA, yielding semiquantitative agreement with experiment. These results were
confirmed by additional simulations in which an external torque was applied to the double helix to induce over- or unwinding of the double helix (Figure 42). The first two and last two base pairs of the duplexes were weakly restrained to limit their displacement in the plane perpendicular to the helical axis of the double helix. Such cylindrical restraints permit free rotation around the z-axis and therefore allow the duplex to display its full twist flexibility. This approach was designed to mimic the weak stretching force applied during torque tweezer experiments to align the duplex along a helical axis. An analysis of the observed helical deformations and their coupling to the twist suggested that the interplay of helical rise, base pair inclination, and displacement from the helix axis upon twist changes could explain the experimentally observed twist-stretch correlations. Overwinding of the RNA produced more compact conformations with a narrower major groove, and consequently reduced helical extension. Conversely, overwinding of DNA reduced the size of the minor groove, and the resulting positive base-pair inclination resulted in helix extension. An alternative MD-bases explanation of the twist-stretch correlation has been suggested more recently in a work that also investigated its dependence
on the stretching force.867 Chemically modified bases can be used to tune thermodynamic stability and hybridization properties of DNA and RNA helices, and their effects can be rather straightforwardly assessed using MD simulations. Fluorinated apolar base analogues generally destabilize DNA and RNA helices and exhibit little
binding sequence specificity.868 They are considered to be isosteric substitutes for nucleobases that do not form H-bonds. An early nanosecond-scale MD study on incorporation of fluorobenzene (i.e., fluorophenyl) nucleobase analogues into ARNA confirmed that these apolar universal bases can be neatly
Figure 42. Model of stretch-twist coupling of A-RNA and B-DNA inferred from MD simulations. (A) Effect of tighter wrapping (overtwisting) of two simplified nucleic acid strands (black lines) around a cylinder (in light blue) at constant radius and with decreasing cylinder radius. The simplified RNA and DNA representations have been generated on the basis of the helical parameters sampled at low twist values (28°, B) and high twist values (34°, C). Backbone is shown in yellow, and bases of the two strands are in blue and brown, respectively. Enlarged blocks of three base pairs separated by approximately one-half a helical turn are shown without the backbone for clarity. In case of RNA (upper panels in B, C), the diameter of the double helix decreases only slightly and the length of the helix decreases with increasing twist. This is achieved with a minimum of steric strain by a more acute inclination (compare black and red arrows in B, C) and a slide motion (without disturbing the base pair geometry) resulting in a more narrow minor groove and compaction along the helical axis. For DNA, the increase of twist results in a significant narrowing of the helix (reflected by large change in x displacement). With a minimum of steric strain this is achieved by a change of inclination in the opposite direction as compared to RNA (compare black and red reference arrows in B, C), which extends the helix.

difluorobenzene, 2,4,5-trifluorobenzene, and 2,3,4,5-tetrafluor
obenzene in the A-RNA duplex.870 Thermodynamic stabilities of the modified RNA duplexes were also determined by thermal denaturation experiments based on UV absorbance measurements, assuming a two-state model for the transition from duplex to single strand. In these experiments, the nucleoside analogues were introduced into the tested sequences so as to form self-pairs. These measurements demonstrated that the pairing stability of fluorinated bases is higher for self-pairs than for pairs with natural bases. The stability of the pairs generally increased with the number of fluorine substituents in the base analogue. However, the greatest gain in stability was observed for the first two fluorinations. Additionally, the stabilities of RNA duplexes containing di-, tri-, and tetra-fluorobenzene selfpairs were similar to or greater than those for duplexes
containing the canonical AU base pair at the same position.870 It has been noted that DNA duplexes exhibit the opposite behavior, being heavily destabilized by the incorporation of a tetrafluorobenzene self-pair. All of these results indicate that the final thermodynamic stability of nucleic acid duplexes depends
on an intricate balance of diverse contributions,870 which is consistent with the results for the thermodynamics of RNA internal loops discussed in section 4.3.3. In other words, thermodynamic stabilities cannot be inferred from simple calculations of base pairing and stacking energies. Experimentally measured RNA stabilities were very well reproduced by the TI computations, which revealed that the at first sight counterintuitive nonadditive effect of increasing the number of fluorinated sites can be correlated with solvation energies and
the solvent-accessible area.870 This work nicely illustrates how theoretical computations can be used to analyze the complex balance of molecular forces in nucleic acids. Later, the same group performed extensive MD simulations with umbrella sampling to calculate pairing free energies between natural nucleobases and a series of fluorinated base analogues in aqueous solution. Although the studied systems lacked the context of a wider nucleic acid structure, a Watson−Crick-like
orientation of the pairs was imposed by restraints.871 These calculations provided further insights into the principles governing interactions of fluorinated bases in RNA and DNA duplexes, suggesting a pronounced enthalpy−entropy compensation during base pair formation.
4.3.10. Kissing-Loop Complexes. The genetic information in retrovirus virions is stored in two identical RNA molecules. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) packages its genomic RNAs as RNA dimers during the late stages of the viral replication cycle. This genomic RNA contains a specific sequence necessary for dimer formation known as the dimerization initiation site (DIS), and the first step of dimerization involves formation of a base paired dimer of
two hairpins that is known as a kissing-loop.597,598 Various kissing-loop complexes are present in other RNA systems and
may be useful components of RNA-based nanostruc
tures.710,872−874
The HIV-1 DIS (Figure 43) and some other kissing-loop complexes have been examined in several MD stud
ies.140,276,489,875−882 The history of MD simulations of RNA kissing-loop complexes illustrates the sampling limitations that arise when simulating even simple RNAs. RNA kissing complexes primarily feature canonical intermonomer base pairing, which is quite well described by the force fields used in most simulations provided that formation of ladder-like artifacts is prevented by using an appropriate χ parameter
ization (see section 3.1.2.1). However, their unpaired (bulged) nucleotides (Figure 43) represent a significant sampling problem. In fact, conformation of the unpaired bases has been a major focus of the simulation studies reported to date because experimental investigations have provided little clarity about this issue. The NMR structures of HIV-1 DIS kissing complexes suggest that the unpaired purines are stacked inside the
helices,883−885 whereas available crystal structures suggest that
they bulge out of the helices and are solvent-exposed.597,598 However, bulging of the purines in the X-ray structures could be due to crystal packing effects, and it is not clear whether positions of the unpaired bases in the NMR structures are derived from the primary NMR data or are artifacts arising from the refinement protocol. While NMR studies agree that the unpaired purines are somewhere inside the kissing-loop pocket, they are mutually inconsistent regarding the bases’ exact positions. NMR structures also generally exhibit structural deformations such as unrealistic values for the glycosidic χ
angles of the unpaired purines.140 Disagreement between the crystallographic and NMR structures complicates biological interpretations of the role of the unpaired purines. One of the first MD studies of kissing complexes simulated the six-base-pair HIV-1 complex on a ∼5 ns time scale as well as a two-base-pair kissing complex on time scales of up to 16 ns
with ff99 force field.489 This study suggested that the kissingloop inner pocket is a major ion binding site, a result that was confirmed by all subsequent studies. The results appeared to support the bulged-out position of the unpaired bases, and predicted a novel arrangement of four stacked bulged-out purines in the HIV-1 kissing-loop complexes that clearly differed from the two separate stacks seen in the X-ray
structure597 available at the time (which was used as the starting structure in the simulations). Several years later, this MD prediction was vindicated by a new X-ray structure showing a quantitatively identical conformation of the unpaired nucleo
tides.598 The older X-ray structure appears to have been affected by crystal packing. The picture painted by simulation results was complicated by a subsequent study on the HIV-1 kissing-loop complex that accumulated almost 1 μs of aggregated simulation data with ff99 force field, with individual runs extending to as much as 50 ns, and used the then-popular locally enhanced sampling (LES)
method (see section 3.2.4).276 This study still supported the bulged-out configuration of the unpaired bases, but because of a tendency to also sample bulged-in arrangements, it suggested that bulged-out geometries are likely to be only slightly preferred in terms of free energies. The true scale of the sampling nightmare was revealed in the subsequent work on this system, which was based on ∼25 μs of
accumulated simulation time primarily with χOL3 force field.140
Although this series of 1 μs-scale simulations was still very far from reaching convergence, it strongly suggested that all four unpaired bases of the kissing-loop complex were moving into the interior of the kissing-loop complex over time. This conclusion was based on a comparison of the short life times of the initial bulged-out conformations and the speed of the transitions to the bulged-in states as the simulation trajectories progressed, combined with the very limited fluctuations in the opposite direction. In other words, even if the bulged nucleobases could temporarily return to the bulged-out geometry in longer simulations, the subsequent short lifetime of the bulged-out conformations would keep their populations

low. When summarizing all of the studies, the simulation time scale had to be extended by almost 3 orders of magnitude (over a period of 12 years) to show the transition of the bulged bases of the HIV-1 DIS kissing-loop complex from the bulged-out to
the bulged-in conformation.140,276,489 The ability to perform simulations over microsecond time scales represents a qualitative step forward in the application of MD to RNA, although even these time scales are short as compared to most dynamic processes occurring in nucleic acids. It is still notable that even the early short simulations provided several useful insights (including observation of the four purine stack and ion-binding pocket) that were confirmed in subsequent MD studies and experiments. For many other systems with well-defined experimental starting structures, short simulations can sometimes provide better results than more extended runs. This suggests that short simulations may often profit from a compensation of errors. Obviously, we do not advocate the use of short simulations in any situation; ideally, all trajectories should be extended as much as possible given the limits of the available hardware. However, quite often interesting insights can be obtained by studying the initial parts of trajectories, before the true complexity of the conformational space and the limitations of the chosen force field are fully expressed. Regarding the HIV-1 DIS kissing-loop complexes, we actually do not think that additional prolongation of simulations would provide any further decisive insights. For nucleic acids systems with different ensembles that are so close in free energy that they coexist or compete, it is unlikely that force-field approximations would allow a confident evaluation of the exact populations even when reaching fully converged sampling. Note that even in the field of the highest-quality gasphase QM calculations, the principal accuracy limit with which one can determine relative energies of different conformations of systems having ∼20 atoms (such as parallel-displaced vs Tshape conformations of isolated benzene dimer or formation of
an isolated base pair) is a few tenths of kcal/mol.886,887 This is known as the chemical accuracy limit. After reaching this limit, attempts to further increase the accuracy are becoming illdefined, oscillatory, and unproductive even upon extreme increases of computational costs. In other words, even for a single van der Waals or H-bonding interaction, we cannot expect that computations can provide entirely “exact” error-free numbers. Consequently, computations of large biomolecular systems where vast numbers of various diverse molecular interactions and energy contributions need to be simultaneously described are necessarily inherently less accurate than calculations of just a single interaction in complete isolation, irrespective of the quality of the used method. The currently available experimental and MD data suggest that both bulged-in and bulged-out conformations of the unpaired bases in kissing complexes are biochemically relevant. The kissing complex may act as a molecular switch like the ribosomal helix 44 decoding center (section 4.5.2) or the 5′UAA/5′-GAN internal loop (section 4.3.5). The kissing-loop complex actually shows sequence and structural similarities to the ribosomal helix 44 decoding center (and interacts with the same antibiotics), implying that its bases should be dynamic and sample coexisting substates that are very close in free energy. Thus, while crystallographic experiments may trap one of the possible conformations available to these systems, NMR ensemble experiments may provide information on mixtures of structures. The abundance of possible microarrangements sampled in the simulations suggests that the bulged-in
conformation is a complex dynamic ensemble of structures, which could be the primary reason for the lack of clear NMR restraints on the bulged adenines. Nonequilibrium pulling simulations (see steered MD discussed in section 3.2.5) with the ff99 force field were performed to follow up on the results of optical tweezer experiments on the two-base-pair kissing-loop complex of the
Moloney murine leukemia virus (Figure 43).888 To see structural transitions on the simulation time scale, the simulations were performed using applied forces of 100−400
pN, while forces used in experiment were 13.5−30 pN.889 The resulting disruptions were observed over time scales of up to 400 ns. The simulations confirmed the suggestion that the external force causes the kissing complex to undergo a barrierless 90° reorientation of its core such that the intermolecular base pairs become parallel to the applied
force.888 This leads to an equal redistribution of the external force over both base pairs, which explains the system’s initially surprising mechanical stability. The force-unfolding mechanism of a kissing complex is thus very different from that of hairpins, which are disrupted by an unzipping mechanism in which the H-bonds are broken one at a time. The simulations also showed that unpaired flanking bases increase the stability of the kissing
complex by stacking on the intermolecular base pairs.888 The stacked adenines are indispensable for the system’s tertiary interactions: by shielding the tertiary base pairs from solvent and reducing their fraying, the stacked flanking adenines make terminal kissing base pairs act more like interior base pairs. The role of different flanking bases was investigated in more detail in a later study that combined MD simulations with new experiments using optical tweezers and electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry.890
4.4. Riboswitches
4.4.1. Introduction to Riboswitches. Riboswitches are regulatory elements located in noncoding regions of mRNAs, mostly in their 5′-UTRs (untranslated regions), which control
the expression of the associated genes.891−895 Although they are
found in all domains of life,896 they are most abundant in bacteria, establishing them as potential targets for novel
antibiotics.33−37 Riboswitches primarily regulate gene expression by terminating transcription or inhibiting translation in response to the binding of a specific small-molecule
ligand.891−895 A notable exception is the glmS ribozyme, a riboswitch that regulates gene expression by catalyzing sitespecific RNA self-cleavage facilitated by a glucosamine-6phosphate cofactor (see section 4.8.3.4). Transcriptional and translational riboswitches consist of two parts: an aptamer domain responsible for sensing and specific binding of the cognate ligand, and an expression platform that regulates gene expression. Binding of the cognate ligand leads to a change in the secondary and tertiary structures of the aptamer domain that is propagated into the expression platform. Transcriptionally acting riboswitches form a terminator loop that initiates transcription termination, while translationally acting riboswitches sequester the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, resulting in translation inhibition. Ligand binding can either suppress or activate transcription/translation. Several riboswitch aptamer domains with bound ligands (i.e., the “holo” forms of the domains) have been extensively structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography and/or NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, only a few structures of the corresponding ligand-free apo-forms have been determined to

date. Therefore, most computational studies have focused on predicting structures of the apo forms and/or providing atomistic descriptions of the structural rearrangement of the aptamer domain induced by ligand binding or dissociation. At first sight, MD simulations can appear straightforward, and they can in principle yield unique mechanistic insights into the relationships between a riboswitch’s structure, dynamics, and function. However, reliably describing the structural rearrangements associated with ligand binding is not trivial due to the long time scales over which these processes typically occur and the complexity of RNA conformations involved. Several studies have used experimentally determined holoform structures as starting points and attempted to predict the structural changes that the aptamer undergoes upon removal of its ligand. Careful comparisons between such simulations and experimental results for the ligand-free state can help to rationalize experimental findings at the atomic level. However, any native structural changes in the aptamer induced by ligand binding or dissociation will typically occur on time scales that are significantly longer (subsecond to second) than those accessible with contemporary atomistic simulations (microseconds). The structural changes observed in simulations must therefore be interpreted very carefully because they may be due to simulation artifacts such as force-field imbalances that are unmasked by long simulations based on a nonequilibrium starting structure obtained by removing the ligand from the structure of the holo complex. That is, the observed structural changes may be unrealistically fast or even wholly unrelated to those that occur in the real system if they result from force-field errors. In addition, as noted by several authors, the activity of at least some transcriptionally acting riboswitches is believed to be
controlled by their folding kinetics.71,72,167,897 Conformational switching typically occurs cotranscriptionally in the context of the RNA polymerase transcription complex, and the structure of an isolated aptamer domain or full-length riboswitch used in experiments and computations may be relatively insensitive to the ligand’s presence or absence. In such cases, simulations of the structure obtained by removing the ligand may be irrelevant for studying the mechanism of riboswitch action. Later, evidence has emerged that assigns a similarly high importance to the cotranscriptional folding of some translational riboswitches, suggesting the riboswitch simultaneously regulates the accessibility of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for ribosome binding and the rho utilization site (rut), binding site for rho
dependent transcription termination.898 Over 20 riboswitch classes have been characterized experimentally. However, computational studies have primarily focused on three groups of riboswitches: (i) purine riboswitches, including adenine-sensing and guanine-sensing riboswitches; (ii) preQ1 riboswitches that sense 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1); and (iii) SAM riboswitches that sense S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).
4.4.2. Purine-Sensing Riboswitches. Multiple crystal structures of purine riboswitches have been determined, revealing that all riboswitches of this class share a similar 2D and 3D architecture featuring three A-form helices (P1−P3)
connected by a three-way junction.899−907 The ligand-binding pocket is buried in this junction region (Figures 44 and 45). Loops L2 and L3, which cap helices P2 and P3, form a tertiary contact classified as a kissing-loop motif (section 4.3.10) with a Y- or wishbone shape; similar arrangement is also found in the full-length hammerhead ribozymes (section 4.8.3.1.2). The P1 stem partially overlaps with the expression platform and thus
helps to transmit information about ligand binding. Although the overall structures of the aptamer domains are very similar, different purine riboswitches use different strategies for regulating gene expression. Both the xpt guanine-sensing and the pbuE adenine-sensing riboswitches act transcriptionally. However, whereas ligand binding to the xpt guanine riboswitch induces the formation of a terminator stem-loop that initiates transcription termination (i.e., switching expression OFF), the pbuE adenine-sensing riboswitch operates by switching gene
expression ON.908,909 Conversely, the add adenine-sensing riboswitch is a translationally acting riboswitch that exposes the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and thus activates translation upon
ligand binding.900,910 Several computational studies have attempted to characterize structural dynamics of the apo-riboswitch upon ligand removal by performing simulations that start from an available holo
form structure with the ligand removed.912−915 As noted above, such simulations must be interpreted carefully because their predictive power is limited by the time scale over which the rearrangement occurs and the difficulty of predicting the intricate apo-structures given the limitations of modern force fields. Despite these challenges, some studies have yielded interesting structural insights that have helped to rationalize experimental observations and suggested new experiments. For example, Priyakumar and MacKerell reported that removing the adenine ligand from the add adenine-sensing riboswitch
increased the flexibility of the P1 stem and the J23 junction.912 They also observed instability of the canonical base pairing between the adenine ligand and uracil U74 in the holo-form. The authors therefore suggested that this interaction is not essential for ligand binding but may somehow be crucial for
ligand recognition.912 However, this behavior could also be due to the use of CHARMM27 force field, which underestimates the stability of RNA base pairs (section 3.1.3 and Figure 8). The latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that this interaction was fully stable in similar simulations performed by

binding purine ligands through hydrogen bonding with their N3 and N9 centers, while C74 is responsible for ligand
specificity originating from WC interactions.913 To explain the mechanism of action of purine riboswitches more completely, their ligand-dependent folding pathways must be modeled and understood. To this end, several studies utilizing either classical MD simulations or enhanced sampling and coarse-graining techniques have been performed. Jain et al. combined classical MD simulations of three purine-sensing riboswitches with fluorescence spectroscopy experiments, using
2-aminopurine as the ligand.911 They observed that, while the conformations seen in the crystal structures corresponded to global minima, their total populations in the simulated solutionphase conformational ensembles were only 50−60% because the ligand sampled multiple conformations in the ligandbinding site. Lin and Thirumalai used Langevin dynamics with a coarse-grained polymer model (see section 3.3.2) to probe
folding mechanism of the add adenine-sensing riboswitch,449 and predicted the folding of the P1 stem to be the final and rate-limiting step of the overall folding pathway (cf., also Figure 45D). In addition, they observed the P3 stem to be more stable than the P2 stem. This seemed to contradict single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments using optical tweezers, which suggested a higher stability of the P2 stem in the related pbuE
adenine-sensing riboswitch.449,916 This discrepancy was finally resolved when Lin et al. showed that the add and pbuE adeninesensing riboswitches do indeed differ with respect to the relative stabilities of the P2 and P3 stems, demonstrating the
fine-tuned stability of their secondary structures.917 In a later study, steered MD (section 3.2.5) was used to assess the stability of the terminal base pair of the P1 stem adjacent to the three-way junction in both apo- and holo-forms
of a purine riboswitch.298 The simulations suggested that direct interaction between the adenine ligand and P1 stem accounts only for a few kJ/mol and thus plays a smaller role than ligand
induced aptamer reorganization in conformational switching.298 To put the experimental and computed data into the right context, one must recognize that the junction is expected to be
significantly different in the apo- form,906 and that MD simulations on the reported time scales cannot capture the large-scale rearrangement from the apo- to the holo-form, which affects the computed free-energy estimate. Nonequilibrium MD simulation designed to capture the temperature-induced energy flow through the molecule suggested that ligand binding to the J23 junction of the xpt guanine-sensing riboswitch is a long-range effect that is coupled with formation of the kissing-loop interaction between the L2
and L3 loops,918 like the coupling observed between the junction-based catalytic core and loops 2 and 3 of a full-length
hammerhead ribozyme.919 Similar coupling between ligand binding and global folding was suggested by Allner et al. for the add adenine-sensing riboswitch on the basis of umbrella sampling (US) simulations performed with the CHARMM36 force field, with the kissing-loop interaction being forced to
open in both the apo- and the holo-forms.284 These authors suggested that kissing-loop formation is anticooperative with
ligand binding, leading to a ΔΔG of ∼10 kcal/mol.284 However, these predictions are inconsistent with the experimentally observed cooperativity between kissing-loop
formation and ligand binding.920 A separate computational study using the AMBER χOL3 force field did observe this
cooperativity between the kissing-loop and ligand.283 The authors of the latter study also discussed the limitations
imposed by the decision to use the distance between the L2 and L3 loops as the collective variable (CV) in the US MD simulation of kissing-loop opening and closing. One such limitation is that CVs not explicitly related to the extent of opening may also play important roles in the process, effectively
acting as slow orthogonal degrees of freedom.283 The latter work thus provided an important discussion of the scope and limitations of the MD technique for riboswitch simulations
(section 3.2.5). Together, these two works283,284 can be seen as a textbook example of how results of MD studies may depend on various aspects of the simulation protocol and sensitivity of enhanced sampling methods to the completeness of the CV description that is chosen. Finally, substrate specificity of the purine riboswitches was
probed using molecular docking921,922 and free-energy
simulations.923 Sund et al. applied the free-energy perturbation (FEP, section 3.2.7) approach to 14 different ligands in both adenine-sensing and guanine-sensing riboswitches, and obtained results suggesting that purine-sensing riboswitches exhibit a high degree of electrostatic preorganization of the
ligand-binding site that favors their cognate ligands.923 This was
also supported by MM-PBSA free-energy calculations.924
4.4.3. PreQ1 Riboswitches. The preQ1 riboswitches regulate expression of several genes encoding enzymes participating in the queuosine biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. Their activity varies in response to the cellular concentration of 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1), which is essential for
tRNA maturation. Three different classes of preQ1 riboswitches
have been identified (Figure 46). Structural characterization of
these classes by X-ray crystallography925−929 and NMR
spectroscopy930,931 showed that preQ1 riboswitches generally form a H-type or the closely related HLout-type pseudoknot structure. The aptamers of class I and class II preQ1 riboswitches partially overlap with their expression platforms such that the closure of the second helix of the pseudoknot upon ligand binding directly sequesters the sequence essential for gene expression. Unlike their class I counterparts, class II preQ1 riboswitches have a small stem-loop inserted between
the two pseudoknotted helices. Two different subtypes of class I preQ1 riboswitches were identified: subtype I regulates gene expression via inhibition of translation, whereas ligand binding to subtype II induces transcription termination. In contrast, class III preQ1 riboswitches have more separated expression and aptamer platforms. They utilize a unique mechanism in which ligand binding to the aptamer domain’s three-way junction rearranges the orientation of the three flanking helices such that a docking platform comes within reach of the distal Shine-Dalgarno sequence and sequesters it to inhibit translation
of the associated gene (Figure 46).926 The first insights into the folding mechanism of the class I subtype II preQ1 riboswitch were obtained by Feng et al. using
atomistic Go̅-model (structure-based-potential) simulations.933
These authors suggested that the riboswitch folds sequentially in the 5′ to 3′ direction; that is, the P1−L1 stem-loop folds first, followed by the formation of tertiary contacts with the L2 loop
and then by P2 stem formation.933 Similar folding pathways
were suggested by all-atom simulations.932,934−937 Petrone et al. used a combination of MD simulations and fluorescence experiments based on site-specific incorporation of 2-aminopurine to study structural dynamics of the class I subtype I
preQ1 riboswitch in its apo-form.935 They proposed that the apo-form retains the pseudoknot structure of the holo-form, but has its ligand binding site occupied by nucleotides from the

L2 loop.935 Conversely, on the basis of NMR experiments and MD simulations, Eichhorn et al. suggested that the A-rich L2 loop is rather flexible in the apo-form, adopting a singlestranded but highly stacked pseudohelical structure that more efficiently explores conformational space to facilitate ligand
binding.937
The crystal structure of the class I subtype-II preQ1
riboswitch apo-form was determined by Jenkins et al.,929 showing that it retains the overall H-type pseudoknot fold, with adenine A14 of the L2 loop occupying the ligand-binding site. Interestingly, the P2 stem containing part of the ShineDalgarno sequence remained intact, so the riboswitch formally remained in the OFF state despite the absence of the ligand
from its binding pocket.929 This discrepancy was rationalized by MD simulations, which showed that the formation of a
complete P2 stem was most likely due to crystal packing:134 the P2 stem was indeed coaxially stacked with the same stem of a neighboring molecule in the crystal lattice, and removing this stabilizing crystal contact in the simulations disrupted the P2 stem, exposing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence to solvent as
would be expected in the ON state.134 Structural dynamics of both apo- and holo-forms of a class II preQ1 riboswitch were studied by Aytenfisu et al., who reported a destabilization of the H-type pseudoknot upon removing the ligand from its binding pocket, causing the Shine-Dalgarno
sequence to become exposed to the solvent.938 Coupling between ligand binding and formation of the P3 helix (which contains the Shine-Dalgarno sequence) was also suggested by
an analysis of correlated fluctuations in the MD simulations.939 Finally, a unique mechanism of action was reported for the class III preQ1 riboswitch on the basis of a combination of X
ray crystallography, MD simulations, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, and ITC
measurements.926 As discussed above, this riboswitch is unique because it does not incorporate the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the expression platform into the aptamer structure. Instead, central binding of preQ1 causes the P4 helix to be positioned
such that its capping J4−5 loop sequesters the Shine-Dalgarno
sequence to form a new helix termed P5 (Figure 46).926
4.4.4. SAM Riboswitches. SAM riboswitches regulate expression of several genes involved in biosynthesis of sulfurcontaining metabolites such as cysteine and methionine in response to the binding of S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM).940−944 Seven different families of SAM-sensing riboswitches have been identified (Figure 47). SAM-I riboswitch folds into a structure with a four-way junction surrounded by two sets of coaxially stacked helices, and regulates gene expression by transcription termina
tion.940,944−947 SAM-IV948 and SAM-I/IV949 riboswitches have similar binding pockets. In contrast, SAM-II riboswitch forms an H-type pseudoknot that sequesters the ShineDalgarno sequence upon ligand binding, regulating gene
expression by translation inhibition.950−952 Consensus sequences, structures, and ligand-binding pocket architectures of this
family are all very similar to those of the SAM-V riboswitch.953 SAM-III riboswitches adopt folds with a three-way junction, with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence being sequestered into the
junction region upon ligand binding.954−956 The last family, SAM/SAH riboswitches, regulates gene expression at the translational level upon binding to either SAM or S
adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).896 Most computational studies on SAM riboswitches have focused on the SAM-I, SAM-II, and SAM-III families. Several MD studies on the SAM-I riboswitch have compared the structural dynamics of its ligand-bound and ligand-free
states.957−960 While the SAM-bound state fluctuated stably around a conformation corresponding to the experimental
crystal structure,960 ligand removal was found to strongly affect dynamics of the J1/2 loop and the P1 helix, which overlaps with

the expression platform.959 Stoddard et al. used a combination of chemical probing, SAXS, and T-REMD simulations (see section 3.2.4) to structurally characterize the apo-form of the
SAM-I riboswitch.957 Their work suggested that the riboswitch is prefolded in the apo-form, sharing certain tertiary interactions with the crystal structure of the holo-form but
sampling an ensemble of conformational states.957 Huang et al. constructed a model of the SAM-I riboswitch extended by the
antiterminator helix.958 They reported a spontaneous shift of
three base pairs from the antiterminator helix to the P1 stem in
the presence of SAM.958 Structural dynamics of the ligand-free SAM-II riboswitch was studied by Kelley and Hamelberg, who reported that after ligand removal the aptamer samples an ensemble of loose pseudoknot conformations including structures corresponding
to the ligand-bound state.961 Doshi et al. performed further simulations of the SAM-II riboswitch with cognate SAM and near-cognate SAH ligands in the ligand-binding site to
rationalize its strong ligand preference for SAM.962 They found that the positively charged sulphonium group on SAM acts as an anchor to the negatively charged ligand-binding site. Conversely, SAH binding was enthalpically disfavored and increased the pseudoknot’s flexibility, exposing the Shine
Dalgarno sequence to the solvent.962 A similar comparison between the binding of the cognate SAM and near-cognate SAH ligands was presented by Priyakumar for the SAM-III riboswitch. This author also reported that the presence of SAH leads to partial liberation of the otherwise occluded Shine-Dalgarno sequence and its
exposure to solvent.963 However, in contrast to the SAM-II study, the selectivity of the SAM-III riboswitch was attributed to nonspecific interactions in the ligand binding pocket that
favor SAM over SAH.963 Finally, Suresh et al. performed ligandfree simulations of the SAM-III riboswitch that suggested that removing the ligand results in partial unfolding and weakening of the interactions between the Shine-Dalgarno and corre
sponding anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequences.964 In summary, atomistic MD simulations used in conjunction with other computational and experimental techniques have provided interesting insights into the structural dynamics of riboswitches. The main obstacle to characterizing these systems by MD is that their most interesting structural changes occur over longer time scales than are currently accessible in conventional MD simulations. Some of the dynamics observed in reported MD studies may thus be artifacts arising from forcefield weaknesses, such as underestimations of base pairing strength (see sections 3.1.2.5, 4.2.2.3, and 4.2.2.4). Nevertheless, some of the observed structural changes may still closely resemble those occurring in the real systems, assuming that force fields correctly identify the weakest parts of the structures. However, the larger are the changes, the more carefully they should be interpreted. Typically, CHARMM simulations tend to predict more structural lability than AMBER simulations.
4.5. Simulations of the Functional Centers of the Ribosome
4.5.1. Introduction to the Ribosomal Decoding Center. The decoding center located on the small ribosomal subunit is one of the most sophisticated dynamic RNA/protein structures (Figure 48). It works with high speed and accuracy for an amazingly broad range of mRNAs and tRNA
substrates,3,965−968 performing two vital tasks: it accurately verifies the formation of canonical base pairing in the first two positions of the minihelix formed by the mRNA and tRNA at the ribosomal A-site, and it then transmits the resulting
information to the other parts of the ribosome.4,8,12,965−968 At the center of this decrypting device is the A-site segment of helix 44 of the small ribosomal subunit, which contains two universally conserved adenines (1492 and 1493) complemented by a single nucleotide in the other strand (the A1492− 3 loop).

A traditional view of the role of the A1492−3 loop is that it performs dynamic proofreading of the codon-anticodon helix formed between the mRNA and tRNA; this view has been taken as an implicit initial assumption in most MD simulations of this system. In this scenario, the two adenines are predominantly stacked inside helix 44 in the ground state, although they also thermally sample other conformations. These adenines are activated by binding of the correct tRNA, and act in conjunction with the universally conserved G530 to monitor the exact shape of the codon−anticodon double helix, leading to on-state of the decoding center (a local configuration of the decoding center corresponding to binding of the cognate tRNA).3,4,8 The decoding center has evolved to tightly discriminate between canonical base pairs and G/U wobble pairs (Figure 2G) at the first and second positions of the codon−anticodon double helix. Its capacity for discrimination stems from the energy penalty caused by the inability of the decoding nucleotides to efficiently interact with G/U wobble pairs leading to unsatisfied H-bond donors and acceptors.3,4,969 With G/U wobble the A1492−93 loop is unable to stabilize the on-state and remains in the off-state. However, as discussed in section 4.5.3, this traditional dynamic model of the A1492−3 loop’s function has been later challenged;12 it was proposed that the decoding center of a complete ribosome might be so rigid that it can host only base pairs whose shapes are identical to the canonical ones (Figure 48). We will call these two
mechanisms the statistical and static models of the A1492−3 loop’s role. The decoding center permits a variety of noncanonical base pairs to be accepted at the third (wobble) position, which allows a single tRNA to read multiple codons. The complementary wobble position 34 of the tRNA often exhibits sophisticated post-transcriptional modifications that tune the decoding process at the third position (see section 4.5.4). The complete decoding center also incorporates other RNA molecules and proteins; a comprehensive description of its structure is beyond the scope of this Review. The A1492−3 internal loop of helix 44 is its most heavily studied component because it is a small RNA internal loop that is responsible for direct discrimination between cognate and near-cognate tRNAs. It is also a target of the paromomycin class of antibiotics, which are assumed to stabilize the flipped-out conformations of the A1492−3 adenines by destabilizing their stacking inside helix 44. In addition to being visualized in
numerous ribosomal X-ray structures,3,12,965−968 the helix 44 part of the decoding center has been studied in isolation by Xray crystallography, by looking at wild type, resistant mutant, human cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial sequences, and with and
without bound antibiotics (Figure 49).970−975

loop), its interaction with antibiotics, and the differences between bacterial, human cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial
sequences.131,239,773,976−983 Even from their earliest stages, all of the MD simulations suggested that the bulge adenines exhibit substantial flexibility and tend to sample a continuum of conformations rather than a few well-defined substates. The calculations supported the view that the bulged-out (i.e., flipped out) conformations of the A1492−3 bases are rarely populated in the absence of binding to a cognate tRNA or interaction with some ligand. Despite increases in simulation times, the application of enhanced sampling methods, and the use of more refined force fields, simulations have consistently shown that the kinetic barriers to the transition between the flipped-in and flipped-out states are low. Importantly, the results obtained appear largely independent of the chosen force field or enhanced sampling method. MD simulations of paromomycin bound to the helix 44 A-site indicated that the neamine part of the antibiotic is the main anchor for binding, whereas the sugar rings provide rather fragile contacts. Long-resident water
molecules were also suggested to contribute to the binding event.773 The A-site loop of helix 44 was one of the first RNA systems on which extended T-REMD (see section 3.2.4) simulations were performed,976 including a 15 μs run (320 ns per replica) for the gentamicin/A-site complex.239 The simulations suggested that the decoding bases flipped on a time scale faster than that of gentamicin binding, supporting a conformation capture mechanism for the antibiotic’s binding rather than an induced-fit model where the bases only flip in the presence of a ligand. The results suggested that the binding should not be viewed as a two-state process, because the ligand’s dissociation involved shuttling between several metastable local minima on the free-energy landscape. MD simulations were also performed to investigate the intrinsic properties of selected helix 44 A-site variants, including bacterial, eukaryotic, human cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial
(native and A1490G mutant) sequences.978−981,983 Simulations suggested sequence-dependent differences in the internal

mobility of the A-site, backbone conformations, and ion and water density distributions inside the binding clefts. Bioinformatics and MD analysis identified a specific RNA backbone conformation known as S-turn2, which occurs commonly in the structures of the human mitochondrial A
site but not in the bacterial variant (Figure 49).980 When present within the helix 44 A-site loop, it spans from nucleotide 1491 to nucleotide 1494. S-turn2 was initially considered to be
a variant of the S-turn backbone conformation,795 a hallmark structural feature of the RNA backbone in the sarcin−ricin loop
(see section 4.3.6).528,529 However, the original bioinformatics analysis was incomplete because the S-turn was defined on the basis of the backbone conformation of just one strand. Later, a classification based on the conformations of five consecutive nucleotides in one strand and three in the other made it possible to clearly differentiate between the S-turn1 and S-turn2
(sub)motifs.984 MD simulations in ref 980 were therefore complemented by a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis that identified numerous other S-turn2 instances in the large
ribosomal subunit.980 Analysis of their sequences did not reveal any consensus sequence pattern. The most weakly conserved nucleotide in the S-turn2 is the one that is flipped out (i.e., the third one, corresponding to A1493 in the A-site loop). Degree of sequence conservation in individual S-turn2 instances depends on their position in the ribosome. No obvious sequence preference for any nucleotide within the S-turn2 submotif emerges when the data for all known instances are grouped. The flipped out S-turn2 nucleotides form tertiary interactions with other parts of the rRNA, and are usually located in buried rRNA regions. Therefore, the S-turn2 was suggested to be a context-dependent structural element like the 5′-UAA/5′-GAN RNA switch (see section 4.3.5) and reverse
kink-turns (section 4.3.7).980 In contrast to the highly rigid “true” S-turn1 backbone conformation, S-turn2 is an easily accessible substate of a “common” RNA strand, that is, a minor conformation accessible to any single-stranded RNA. MD simulations clearly showed the lack of any relationship between
the S-turn1 and S-turn2 conformations,980 suggesting that the S-turn2 unit identified in the human mitochondrial A-site structures acts as a dynamic molecular switch that tunes the proper functioning of the A-site via tertiary interactions. The MD simulation data indicated that mitochondrial and bacterial A-sites show different propensities to adopt S-turn2 conformations due to the different base-pairing patterns of their
flanking nucleotides.980 This different propensity may contribute to the greater accuracy and lower speed of mRNA decoding in mitochondria relative to bacteria. Additionally, collective fluctuations of stacked A1408−C1409−C1410 nucleotides in the mitochondrial variant may modulate aminoglycoside
antibiotic binding affinities.980 MD simulations were used to study the binding of antibiotics to the aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AME) that enable
bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics.985 A comparison of the aminoglycoside binding sites for several AME receptors revealed that the enzymes efficiently mimic the rRNA binding cleft. Although the internal dynamics of AMEs and their interaction patterns with aminoglycosides differ from those of the RNA binding site, the energy analyses suggested that key interactions in the enzymes may closely resemble those in the RNA. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations have been used to
study binding of diverse antibiotics to the helix 44 A-site.977 Although this alternative methodology has severe limitations
(among other things, the RNA and encounter complexes are represented by a single conformation each, the internal mobility of ligands is not explicitly taken into account, and the continuum solvent approximation is used), it allows broader sampling of ligand association and dissociation pathways than is possible with MD methods. The BD simulations were performed to estimate diffusion-limited rates of association but also yielded visualizations of the way the antibiotic molecules “glide” around the RNA and predicted that antibiotic binding is only weakly dependent on the ionic strength. BD simulations were also used to study the kinetics and association
of paromomycin to the entire 30S ribosomal subunit.986 The resulting model suggested that specific binding at the ribosomal A-site starts with nonspecific antibiotic diffusion toward the 30S subunit and is followed by exploration of the subunit’s
surface.977 The calculations did not suggest any specific longrange electrostatic navigation through the landscape to the Asite, but identified two entrances to the A-site around which the mobility of paromomycin is high. These entrances may help to funnel the binding process. The antibiotic also visited known binding sites for other drugs targeting the 30S subunit, and interacted with diverse positions along helix 44. This promiscuity of its binding may explain the overall tendency of paromomycin to stabilize the 70S complex. An alternative binding cleft in the 30S subunit may be related to the antibiotic’s inhibitory effect on translocation. All of these results are consistent with the hypothesis that aminoglycoside antibiotics have multiple mechanisms of action, which was
suggested on the basis of experimental findings.987 Thus, while structural data strongly suggest that paromomycin affects the free-energy landscape of the A1492−3 loop, it also seems to interfere with translocation and other processes essential for
proper elongation.987 BD has also been used to study
association of elongation factor G with the ribosome.986 These BD calculations demonstrate that diverse computational approaches can complement each other in studies on various aspects of the ribosome’s function. MD simulations were also used to study the intrinsic
flexibility of the complete helix 44 structure.131 In ribosomal Xray structures, helix 44 is bent into an arc. Further, cryo-EM experiments indicated that during EF-G dependent tRNA translocation, the A-site region of helix 44 moves toward the P
site by approximately 8 Å.988 MD simulations revealed that the isolated helix 44 is intrinsically straight but undergoes pronounced and instantaneous bending processes due to isotropic thermal fluctuations. Simulation snapshots suggested that this helix undergoes spontaneous motions with even greater degrees of bending than are seen in the ribosomal X-ray structure. Helix 44 thus appears to have more than enough flexibility to tolerate the bending exhibited by its upper part in the cryo-EM studies within the genuine harmonic regime of elasticity. Thermal fluctuations of the simulated RNA were used to develop an elastic model of helix 44 in which the helix is treated as an extensible, twistable, and bendable anisotropic elastic rod. Analysis of local base-pair step deformabilities revealed a patch of more flexible base-pair steps in the upper part of the helix and the area proximal to the A1492−3 nucleotides, suggesting that this region has intrinsically
enhanced flexibility.131 Such coarse-grained elasticity models have been instrumental in studies of sequence-dependent DNA
flexibility.824,862−864 Although they are primarily applicable to canonical helices, they can also be used to describe other RNA
segments that are assumed to exhibit functional flexibility.824,989

Despite that the MD simulations discussed above provided important insights, we must caution that, although the helix 44 A-site loop appears to be a simple structure at first glance, it is very difficult to meaningfully simulate by MD even when treated in complete isolation. Unlike many other RNAs, no systematic analyses of the possible limitations and errors of simulations for the A-site loop of helix 44 are available. No specific problems were reported in the early publications, even though they relate to simulations performed with older force fields that should quite quickly develop simulation artifacts. Conversely, simulations of the complete helix 44 sequence performed by Reblova et al. using the ff99 force field predicted significant (∼20%) populations of γ-trans states (which essentially correspond to a “crankshaft” conformation of the
A-RNA backbone) along the whole helix.131 Although formation of these states was reversible, they were long-lived and caused substantial local reductions of the helical twist. This behavior has been identified as undesirable, and demonstrated
the usefulness of the bsc095 α/γ reparameterization (which was originally developed for DNA) in RNA simulations (section 3.1.2.1). Such γ-trans states are a common minor conformation in A-RNA X-ray structures, where they are associated with local
A-RNA kinks likely stabilized by crystal packing,858 or
accompany some adjacent noncanonical features.57 Therefore, the complete elimination of γ-trans backbone states from ARNA in simulations using bsc0 is likely excessive; see section
3.1.2.1.132,857 However, no better treatment of the γ-trans substates has been suggested so far. Nevertheless, the main uncertainty in helix 44 simulations relates to the description of bulged bases. Although this initially appears straightforward, it is actually very difficult to do accurately in terms of sampling, especially given force-field uncertainties (see sections 4.3.2 and 3.1.1.3). Because one needs to capture balance between substates that are roughly isoenergetic, even a small forcefield bias could have a large impact on the calculated populations. Unfortunately, unambiguous benchmark experimental data that could be used to rigorously evaluate the
descriptions of flexible bulge RNA regions990 provided by various force fields are missing (see also the discussion on the difficulties of simulating kissing complexes in section 4.3.10). Precise sampling of bulges would require balanced descriptions of many difficult terms such as base stacking, solvation− desolvation, diverse intramolecular H-bonds, and noncanonical backbone conformations. Inclusion of antibiotics adds further uncertainty to the modeling of the decoding center. Force fields for ligands are usually parameterized using “automated” procedures such as
the general AMBER force field (GAFF).991 While this is very convenient, it is a double-edge sword in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the resulting force fields. A more rigorous approach would be to prepare ligand force fields on a case-bycase basis using careful QM-based parameterizations. However, such procedures are vastly more time-consuming and require
substantial skill.372 In addition, the molecular and electronic structures of antibiotics are usually very complex, and it is not clear that they are fully describable within the basic approximations of typical force fields. It is particularly challenging to develop satisfactory force field parameterizations for the antibiotics’ carbohydrate components, whose flexibility
may have profound effects on binding.992,993 In addition, the total net charge of aminoglycoside antibiotics (+5 in the case of paromomycin) presents a major problem. We consider the
reliability of existing antibiotic force fields to be completely unaddressed in the literature. An earlier comparison of the AMBER and CHARMM force
fields for helix 44 simulations978 illustrated the lower structural stability of A-RNA simulations performed with the latter force field, which is consistent with many other studies (see section 3.1.3). On the other hand, MD and free-energy simulations of the A1492−3 A-site loop in different studies suggested a broad qualitative consistency between the available AMBER and CHARMM RNA simulations.
4.5.3. Ribosomal Decoding Center: Larger Models. Even more challenging than simulations on isolated A1492−3 bulges (i.e., oligonucleotide models of the A-site, Figure 49) are MD studies involving larger segments of the ribosomal decoding center. Such studies are ultimately necessary for understanding the overall context of decoding, which cannot be obtained by studying isolated A1492−3 oligonucleotide constructs. Experimental studies have posed many fascinating questions about the decoding center that warrant computational analysis. For example, a series of newer X-ray structures on the complete 70S T. thermophilus ribosome including mRNA and near-cognate tRNAs revealed a striking incorporation of G/U base pairs at the first and second positions of the
codon−anticodon double helix (Figure 48).12,966−968 Amazingly, the G/U base pairs did not adopt the common wobble geometry, but appeared to be forced into a near-canonical (cognate-like, Watson−Crick-like) geometry. This can be explained either by a rare tautomerization (of either G or U)
or by nucleobase ionization.12,966−968 In line with suggestions
of others,994 we assume that formation of the guanine enol tautomer is the most likely explanation for the observed geometries because deprotonation of U or G would not resolve the close contact between the U(O4) and G(O6) oxygens, and the rare enol tautomers of U are less likely to form than that of
G.995−1000 The newer crystal structures are inconsistent with the earlier visualization of incorporation of the G/U base pair into the ribosome A-site, which showed the expected wobble
G/U conformation and an inactive decoding center.3,4,969 The earlier studies were done on the 30S subunit alone, and lacked a covalently linked mRNA in the P-site. Complete 70S ribosome structures show a much more tightly defined environment around the decoding center, including a sharp kink in the
mRNA between the A and P sites (Figure 48b).12,966−968 In fact, configuration of the decoding center around the “tautomeric” G/U base pairs is virtually indistinguishable from the arrangement of the decoding center when reading the canonical base pairs of the cognate tRNA. Importantly, the structures even featured domain closure of the small ribosomal subunit in the presence of the Watson−Crick-like G/U base pairs. Domain closure is a hallmark rearrangement of the small
subunit involving head rotation and shoulder movement.3,4 Domain closure movement in the complete ribosome appears to be similar but less pronounced than that in the isolated
subunit.12,966−968 Domain closure may be important for signaling to the large ribosomal subunit that a correct tRNA has been bound. These results collectively suggest that in the presence of Watson−Crick-like G/U base pairs, the small subunit in a complete ribosome (incorrectly) signals the binding of a cognate tRNA and the ribosome is fully competent
to proceed with elongation.12,966−968 Similar Watson−Crick-like base pairing has previously been reported for the incorporation of GTP opposite to T in a crystal structure of human DNA polymerase λ. In this case, the

authors suggested that pH dependence of the misinsertion is
consistent with ionization.1001 Tautomer-like base pairing was also observed for an A/C base pair in a crystal structure of a
high-fidelity DNA polymerase.1002 Further, NMR relaxation dispersion experiments indicated that the common G/T and G/U wobble mispairs in DNA and RNA duplexes coexist in dynamic equilibrium with short-lived low-populated Watson− Crick-like mispairs that are stabilized by either rare enolic tautomers or anionic bases. Populations of the minor species
were found to be from 10−3 to 10−5.1003 Such populations are consistent with numerous QM calculations showing that, although none of the natural nucleic acid bases forms stable rare tautomers in water, minor transient populations of these
tautomers should be present.998,1004 These independent observations of trapped Watson−Crick-like G/U, G/T, and A/C base pairs refreshed decades-old suggestions that rare tautomers may contribute to (or even determine) error rates in key biochemical processes responsible for coding and read
ing.1005−1007 The main objection to the proposed biochemical relevance of tautomers stems from the substantial energetic penalty associated with their formation. These penalties were
quite rigorously determined in earlier QM studies.1004 The freeenergy penalties of tautomerization are definitely larger than
those associated with nucleobase ionization at neutral pH.1008 U, T, and A should not tautomerize to any appreciable extent;
G and C readily form rare tautomers in the gas
phase,995−1000,1004 but polar solvents strongly stabilize their
major tautomeric forms.998,1004 One might thus ask whether the observed rare tautomers are genuinely biochemically important or are just incidentally trapped in low-temperature X-ray crystallography experiments. The difference between these two interpretations is as follows. Both of them agree that minor tautomers can be stabilized in the decoding center and thus observed. However, the original one assumes that the energy penalty of locally stabilizing the rare tautomer state is so large as to be incompatible with the overall free-energy balance of decoding or replication. Decoding also involves the transfer of information to the large subunit via different substates of the head of the small subunit, that is, the domain closure. According to the original interpretation, the error rate is primarily attributable to some pathways in which the bases are in their canonical tautomeric states and thus form a G/U wobble during the elongation process. Erroneous translation could proceed as a result of a rare event, with the decoding
center occasionally reaching the on-state3,4,8 even when the G/ U wobble is present, or even when the decoding center is locally in the off-state if the whole subunit undergoes
sufficiently large thermal fluctuations.994 The newer interpretation assumes that the ribosomal decoding center is so

discriminative that it is absolutely incapable of binding the G/U base pair in its wobble form, leading to a zero error rate via all pathways involving the G/U wobble conformation. Two comprehensive simulations and free-energy studies were performed to clarify the potential contribution of tautomers to ribosomal error rates using sophisticated models
of larger fragments of the decoding site.982,994 The first study analyzed ribosomal complexes with cognate and near-cognate tRNAs, with the aim of capturing the structures and energetics
of G/U mismatches in the first two codon positions.994 The simulations were done with the CHARMM22 force field using spherical simulation systems. The model system was derived from the crystal structure of the ribosome by defining a sphere with a radius of 25 Å centered on the N1 atom of the first codon position, and excising the structure enclosed by the sphere. The excised structure was then placed in a spherical water droplet with a radius of 37 Å, yielding the model to be studied. Water molecules at the surface of the droplet were subjected to radial and polarization restraints. Solute atoms 22−25 Å from the sphere’s center were tightly restrained, while atoms inside an inner sphere of 22 Å radius that contained all of the important segments of the studied systems were unrestrained. MD simulations of this sort are less common than standard simulations using periodic boundary conditions. However, when studying a segment of the ribosome that cannot be meaningfully defined as isolated entity, conventional periodic box simulations are unsuitable. Free energies associated with different scenarios were evaluated using the free-energy perturbation (FEP) method (see section 3.2.7), revealing that tautomeric base pairs can indeed be trapped with the ribosomal decoding center in the on-state. The G enol form thus explains the crystallographic observations. However, the calculated overall free energies after adding the free-energy penalty of tautomerization suggest that the tautomer should not cause high codon reading error frequencies, as the calculated tRNA binding is too heavily destabilized relative to the cognate complex to cause significant error rates (Figure 50). A similar picture was suggested by a newer study that combined fluorescence and NMR experiments with conceptually similar MD simulations using the CHARMM36 force
field variant.982 The authors first performed two-dimensional umbrella sampling (US) free-energy simulations to obtain a reference free-energy landscape for A1492−3 flipping in an isolated helix 44 oligonucleotide model (see section 3.2.5). Pseudodihedral angles for flipping were used as the collective
variables for the US calculations.1009,1010 The calculations depicted the free-energy cost of extrahelical flipping (conformational excitation) of 1492−3 and showed that A1493 exhibits enhanced mobility. The free-energy cost of fully flipping A1492−3 into the active proofreading-like conformation was estimated to be around 7 kcal/mol in the isolated A1492−3 internal loop. Subsequent US simulations including paromomycin suggested that its binding reduces this cost to ∼3 kcal/ mol, quantifying the free-energy change that leads to the loss of discrimination upon antibiotic binding. The authors then extended the US computations using a 25 Å spherical model of the decoding center with bound tRNA and canonical G/C, G/ U wobble, or G/U tautomer base pairs in the first position of the mRNA/tRNA minihelix. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the authors chose to examine the enolic U form of the base pair, instead of the more likely G enol case. Full flipping of the A1492−3 adenines into a conformation capable of reading the codon−anticodon minihelix was associated with free-energy
changes of ca. −1 and +2 kcal/mol for cognate and nearcognate tRNAs. Interestingly, upon calculating and adding the keto-to-enol tautomerization free-energy penalties, the obtained free energies again suggested that the “rare-tautomer” state was less favorable than either the cognate complex or the nearcognate complex with the G/U wobble. Thus, these calculations also suggest that the X-ray structures with Watson−Crick-like G/U pairs trapped a less stable state that is unlikely to give a major contribution to the overall error rate. The authors also proposed an overall free-energy model of tRNA selection and accommodation. Note that, although both studies utilized seemingly similar spherical models, they employed different methods to calculate the free energies (see sections 3.2.5 and 3.2.7). The first study evaluated free energies via alchemical mutations and
thermodynamic cycles.358 The second study was based on calculation of changes in the free-energy landscape (reaction pathways) of the system with A1492−3 flipped out under different codon−anticodon minihelix scenarios. The qualitative consistence between the two studies is thus encouraging. Although we assess the experiments and computations that have been performed to determine the role of tautomerization in the ribosome decoding and error rates, we take no position about which of the two views on its role is more likely to be correct. It is obvious that tautomerization must always be a rare event. However, once it happens in the decoding site, it is likely to lead to GTP hydrolysis on the elongation factor,
accommodation, and translocation.1011 An open question is “when does tautomerization occur, does it then permanently lock the tautomers in stable base pairing, and is it associated with the highest probability path to tRNA mis-accommodation?” The X-ray crystallographic data are convincing and suggest that the ribosomal decoding center has a previously unanticipated capability to strictly enforce a WC-like geometry in the first and second positions of the codon−anticodon
helix.12,966−968 Structural evidence suggests that the decoding center has strong discriminatory power against both the wobble
geometry (which is near-isosteric40,47 with the canonical base pairing) and other undesired base pairs. It eliminates bulkier base pairs such as A/A, and penalizes the narrowing of the codon−anticodon helix that occurs in the presence of smaller base pairs such as U/U. Surprisingly, base pairing may also be closely monitored at the P-site, because even in this position the X-ray structures captured the tautomeric form of the G/U
base pair.966 This led to the suggestion that the tautomeric base pair may travel through the ribosome while locked in the tautomeric state from the early binding event. It should be noted that the above-described computations that rather do not support the dominant contribution of the tautomers to the error rates may be affected by some uncertainties ranging from the used CHARMM force field (which in addition was used in its older version in the first study discussed) to the inability to describe the true coupling of the decoding center’s conformations to the overall ribosome dynamics. Because it was only possible to perform calculations on medium-sized spherical models of the A-site, the simulations could not directly capture the coupling of the local action of the decoding center to domain closure. Additionally, the calculations may be sensitive to common uncertainties in various types of free-energy computations. For example, even when studying a simple isosteric guanine-to-inosine substitu
tion in a short canonical A-RNA,367 it was not possible to

achieve fully quantitative accuracy using a conceptually similar thermodynamics integration (TI) method (see sections 3.2.7 and 4.3.3). It is also not fully clear whether the equilibrium freeenergy penalty of tautomerization of isolated nucleobases in water is fully transferable to the desolvated interior of the A-site of the elongating ribosome; we would like to reiterate that G
readily tautomerizes in the gas phase.996,1004 Finally, because the models were derived by excision of substructures from medium-resolution ribosomal structures, it is difficult to ensure their full equilibration when attempting to perform quantitative calculations (see discussion of the difficulties of obtaining good starting structures for protein/RNA complexes in section 4.7.1). However, also the significance of the X-ray crystallography data is far from being “crystal-clear”. One of the theoretical studies listed several reasons why tautomers might be trapped in crystal structures but not make a major contribution to the
error rate.994 For example, the low temperatures (100 K) used in crystallography may facilitate tautomer trapping. High Mg2+ concentrations (as used in crystallographic experiments) are known to increase error rates in protein synthesis and may support flipping out of the A1492−A1493 bases. The experiments were done in high excess of the noncognate tRNAs. These points do not yet seem to have been convincingly rebutted. As shown for systems such as small ribozymes, great uncertainties are common when attempting to use static ground-state structures or structural snapshots obtained by X-ray crystallography to analyze transient chemical processes that involve dynamic structural reorganization (see sections 4.8.3.2.2 and 4.8.3.3). Further, complete freezing of rare-tautomer base pairs since the early stages of the tRNA binding (i.e., the model assuming the preformed and rigid decoding center) is not in agreement with kinetic experiments on initial codon selection of tRNA in the ternary complex with
the elongation factor.1012 In addition, it would likely knock out subsequent contribution of ribosome proofreading mechanism to error reduction, which also contradicts biochemical experi
ments.1012 This rigid-center model also does not explain the role of aminoglycoside antibiotics. The biochemical experiments thus suggest that if the tautomers contribute to the error rates, they would do so in a dynamical system allowing fast tautomeric form equilibrations and not in a process with frozen canonical-like tautomeric base pairing preventing relocations of the hydrogen atoms around the nucleobase rings. Further, cryoEM studies support conformational mobility of the A1492−93 loop, which is consistent with the flexible model of the
decoding center and dynamical error control.1013,1014 We speculate that errors caused by misreading of the G/U base pairs may occur via multiple pathways, and that all of the above-mentioned scenarios may coexist to some degree. This discussion resembles the never-ending debates about the relative importance of conformational capture and induced fit recognition mechanisms in biomolecular recognition: in reality, biochemical systems seem to often use a combination of both mechanisms, and such combined mechanisms may in fact be more evolutionarily robust. While the new X-ray structures
featuring complete ribosomes12,966−968 demonstrate the potential inadequacy of the earlier X-ray structures featuring
only the small subunit,3,4,8 they still do not (and cannot) show the ribosome when it is inserting the tRNA into the decoding site. This is probably a very dynamic process that occurs at temperatures much higher than those used in crystallography; moreover, the presence of the bound elongation factor that
delivers the tRNA (which is not included in any currently available X-ray structure with the tautomers) may substantially affect the whole ribosome’s sampling of its conformational space. We also feel that studies on ribosomal ambiguity mutations indirectly support some dynamic behavior of the
small subunit.1015 Thus, there are two limiting scenarios regarding the operation of the decoding center: the statistical scenario, in which the decoding center dynamically samples its conformational space; and the static scenario in which the decoding center is strictly structured. Both views are equally consistent with isosteric recognition of the codon−anticodon base pairs. It may be that the ribosome uses both scenarios in a multipathway process, and the balance between the two scenarios may vary during the tRNA binding process and depending on the external conditions. In conclusion, the contribution of rare tautomers to error rates in ribosomal protein synthesis remains one of the most challenging problems for future MD computations. The ultimate description of this process would require methods that reflect the ribosome’s large-scale molecular dynamics. Without wishing to understate the power and importance of X-ray crystallography, inherently dynamic processes cannot be fully judged from static structures, and there is sometimes a tendency in the crystallographic literature to underestimate the need for Boltzmann sampling in the description of chemical processes. Regarding further computational studies, it will be very important to see if calculations using other approaches, other force fields, and differently defined model systems provide the
same quantitative results as the studies reported to date.982,994 Studies on the potential involvement of tautomers in the mechanism of the DNA polymerase could be particularly interesting, because the polymerase is less complex than the
decoding center of the ribosome.1001,1002 Indeed, first freeenergy perturbation study of DNA polymerase λ investigated incorporation of deprotonated and tautomer dGTP·dT base
pairs into the active site.1016 Spherical model of the polymerase has been used, with the center located at the initial position of the C4′ atom of dGTP. The simulations were performed with the AMBER χOL4εζOL1
100,146 force field and suggested that the canonical-like GT base pair with the G enol tautomer is equally stable as the wobble GT base pair in the context of the polymerase. The base pair variants with either thymine rare
tautomer or deprotonated G− were found to be less stable. The authors nevertheless cautioned, consistently with suggestions of our Review, that contemporary computational methodologies do not allow one to draw any quantitative conclusions from such computations due to the numerous approximations used. It is also important to point out that roles of rare nucleobase tautomers in the polymerase and the ribosomal decoding center may differ. In fact, different classes of polymerases may use different mechanisms to identify even canonical base pairs. While most of them definitely utilize the stericity of the base pairs as the primary discriminator, there are indications that some polymerases also monitor base pairing energies, that is,
the direct strengths of the H-bonds.1017,1018 In summary, recent X-ray structures provide considerable indirect evidence suggesting a previously unrecognized role of
the decoding center.12,966−968 The suggested complex cascade of events involving the whole ribosome makes it even more difficult to reliably simulate ribosomal behavior than was previously thought. Instead of having flexible A1492−3 and G530 nucleotides that dynamically discriminate between canonical and wobble geometries of the tRNA-mRNA

interactions, the new structural data suggest that the decoding center (and the whole ribosome) has a fixed a priori structuration that forces the G/U base pairs into a “canonical” like geometry. The data indicate that A1493 is flipped out even in the absence of the A-site tRNA due to the steric effect of the sharp kink of the mRNA between the P- and A-sites, and the binding of the tRNA at the P-site. The A-site may then become fully structured after the nonspecific binding of the ternary complex (i.e., the tRNA and its elongation factor) to the ribosome. This could affect the complex balance of many interactions in the ribosome, including the B2a intersubunit
bridge between helix 44 and helix 69.12,966−968 The aminoacyl tRNA (aa-tRNA) anticodon would then enter a preformed stiff decoding center instead of a dynamic “proofreading” device. Instead of the A1492−3 loop, the anticodon of the tRNA would then extensively sample its conformational space to establish the codon−anticodon double helix. The error rate could thus be linked to the ∼4 kcal/mol free-energy penalty of tautomerization, which would reduce the binding free energy (due to the low probability of the tautomer being present at the right moment) of the near-cognate tRNA to the preformed stiff decoding site. However, as underlined above, this rigid model of decoding center contradicts many other experimental data. We still suggest that the statistical and static models of decoding center may to some extent represent two sides of the same coin, and, in reality, all of the involved partners may undergo substantial thermal sampling to establish the final interaction in a multipathway process. Complex chemical systems often do not act in a strictly single-pathway manner because the evolution of such single-pathway systems is less probable in entropic terms than that of multipathway reactions. The uncertainties in description of the role of monitoring bases, shapes of base pairs, formation of tautomers, domain closure, and numerous other factors involved in ribosome decoding are reminiscent of uncertainties surrounding the description of catalytic mechanisms of small ribozymes (see section 4.8.3.2.2). It has been recently suggested that the catalytic action of hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, a very simple system as compared to the ribosome, cannot be explained on the basis of a single structure, as it takes places on a very rugged free
energy surface.1019 It should be noted that even the existing kinetic models of the ribosome decoding, assuming participation of a few states, are likely oversimplified. In reality, the decoding might involve an enormously complex network of mutually interrelated and competing kinetic steps, which may lead to complex multiple-pathway overall process. As underlined by other authors, further experiments with improved structural and kinetic resolution will be essential to obtain a more accurate picture of the contribution of tautomers to
decoding errors.1012 Numerous real participating processes and states may merge in the current kinetics models into only few effective steps due to the natural resolution limits of experimental techniques. This is reminiscent of the description of complex multiple-pathway folding landscapes, where simple few-state models were shown to be often unrealistic, despite being formally in agreement with the available experimental
data.170 Advanced computations will almost certainly help, as complement to the experiments, to fully understand the decoding process.
4.5.4. Calculations on Other Ribosomal Centers. Simulations, free-energy calculations, and QM studies of reaction pathways using spherical models of the different centers of the ribosome have also been used extensively to
understand other key aspects of ribosome decoding.1020−1024 Free-energy simulations were performed to characterize
different cognate and noncognate termination complexes.1022 Simulations characterized the basic principles of decoding in all three codon positions and tentatively identified key elements responsible for the specificity of the release factors. They also revealed potential roles for several novel interactions, and emphasized the versatility of codon reading by proteins, which goes far beyond simple tRNA mimicry. Other simulations were performed to analyze the origin of discrimination between isoleucine (AUA) and methionine (AUG) codons in the decoding site, which relies on posttranscriptional tRNA modifications. The modification of the “wobble” C34 position of the tRNA anticodon was scrutinized by simulating the 2agmatinylcytidine (agm2C34) derivative found in archaeal
tRNAs,1024 and FEP simulations (see sections 3.2.7 and 4.5.3) were performed for cognate and noncognate ribosometRNA complexes. The starting structure of the AUG Met codon was obtained by mutating the AUA Ile codon inside a 25 Å spherical model of the ribosomal A-site. Calculations were performed for the archaeal tRNAI2le with the CAU anticodon,
which would, without the C34 modification, readily read the Met AUG codon. Simulations were performed with and without the agm2C34 modification, and with the UAU anticodon as a control. Starting structure was based on the crystallographic structure of the cognate 70S T. themophilus ribosome complex with archeal tRNAI2le accommodated in the A-site. The FEP simulations suggested that the tight local hydrophobic environment created by the side chains of the modification and supported by the ribosomal G530 penalized unsatisfied hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors for the AUG codon, yielding a large energetic discrimination of about 7 kcal
mol−1 (cf., also comments about unsatisfied hydration sites in section 4.3.3). The effect of hydrophobicity was found to be bolstered by steric effects, and the formation of the cytosine imino tautomer was found to be unlikely. Simulations based on the crystal structure of elongation
factor-Tu (EF-Tu) ternary complex bound to the ribosome1025 analyzed the role of the universally conserved EF-Tu histidine 84, which has been proposed to act as the general base in
guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis.1026,1027 Free-energy computations of different protonation states that could be involved in the activation of this reaction indicated that the histidine is unlikely to act as the general base, but must be protonated in an active conformation to enable GTP hydrolysis. The simulations also suggested that the sarcin−ricin loop of the ribosomal helix 95 spontaneously places the histidine in the catalytically active conformation (Figure 51). Conformational dynamics of the peptide plane preceding the conserved histidine have been proposed to be critical for facilitation of the reaction. The unusually high catalytic rates of EF-Tu were explained by a very large positive activation entropy of more than 7 kcal/mol at room temperature. It has been argued that this is a unique feature of translational GTPases, which achieve hydrolysis rates
exceeding 500 s−1. This entropy-driven mechanism may have evolved to ensure that the speed of protein synthesis is not
limited by the rate of GTPase activity.1028 A comparison with nonribosomal GTPases involving analyzing Arrhenius plots of the temperature dependence of the calculated free-energy profiles suggested that different mechanistic pathways are associated with distinct differences in activation entropies and enthalpies. The computed activation parameters have been extensively compared to experimental data. It also seems that

amino acid composition of the catalytic centers.1029
4.6. Atomistic Explicit-Solvent Simulations of a Complete Ribosome
Atomistic explicit solvent simulations of the whole ribosome represent a particularly attractive and challenging application of
MD methods.1031−1043 The first atomistic MD study of the whole ribosome (containing 2.46 × 106 atoms) simulated accommodation of the bound tRNA from the A/T state into
the ribosome during decoding.1038 The simulations required state-of-the art hardware with near-linear scaling to 768 processors, and were done on the nanosecond time scale, with a total sampling of 20 ns. One of the most delicate issues was the preparation of the starting structure, which was primarily based on a homology model of a previously reported
complete T. themophilus ribosome structure model,1044 with further structural refinements of the ribosomal A and P sites, modeling of the mRNA path, and some other necessary steps. The enormous size of the system and the limited time scale required the application of targeted MD simulation techni
que,299 here with the ribosomal A/T state used as the starting structure and the A/A state as the target structure (see section 3.2.5). This work was the first to model the path of the tRNA during accommodation and identified ∼70 nucleotides of the 23S rRNA that may interact with the aminoacyl-tRNA (aatRNA) during the process, suggesting that the ribosomal Aloop and helix 89 play the dominant roles in guiding the tRNA. Over the following decade, the sophistication of atomistic simulations of complete ribosomes increased substantially, and they were extensively combined with experimental studies. Series of 100−200 ns explicit-solvent simulations (3.2 million atoms, with an aggregate simulation time of 1.4 μs) combined with a Go̅-type biased (structure-based) atomistic model and
supplemented by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments were performed to investigate the balance between configurational entropy and effective enthalpy during the accommodation process (Figure
52).1035 This balance is suggested to lead to spontaneous reversible accommodation attempts. It has been proposed that the configurational entropy of the 3′-CCA end of the aa-tRNA opposes accommodation, leading to a multistep accommodation process involving multiple parallel pathways. A 1.3 μs atomistic explicit-solvent simulation of the E. coli ribosome in a pretranslocation state was used to separate ribosomal movements according to the time scales on which
they occur.1032 To capture the collective rotational dynamics of the ribosomal subunits and separate them from fast thermal fluctuations of individual residues, the authors used an iterative protocol to identify a semirigid ribosome core that exhibits subangstrom internal displacements. The study identified several core regions (the 50S subunit, and the head and body of the 30S subunit) that moved relative to one another in a coordinated manner. Rotations and tRNA movements were measured using carefully selected reaction coordinates. 30S subunit body and head rotations during translocation over the course of the MD simulation were observed on scales of −2° and 5°, respectively. These movements are smaller than the functional angular displacements indicated by experiments (7° and 20°, respectively), suggesting that simulations cannot yet capture functional dynamics accurately. This may be related to the time scale of the simulation, uncertainties in the starting structures, or force-field deficiencies. Regardless, the data were successfully used to describe the 30S subunit body rotation, head movement, and tRNA displacement as diffusion processes along the reaction coordinates. This enabled separation of slow large-scale collective movements from fast local fluctuations. In contrast to the core regions, about one-half of the rRNA residues were reported to undergo uncoupled thermal fluctuations. This behavior was typical for the peripheral

regions of the ribosome. A more recent study using structurebased atomistic model has suggested that the aa-tRNA accommodation kinetics can be modulated by the L11 stalk
mobility.1045 It has also been suggested that the steric composition of EF-Tu can reduce the free-energy barrier associated with the initial stages of aa-tRNA accommoda
tion.1046 All-atom simulations of a complete ribosome model (3 000 000 atoms) were performed to study the dynamics and
opening of the L1 stalk region.1039 Full-ribosome simulations were combined with several simulations of reduced systems including the P/E state tRNA, the L1 stalk, and some proximal ribosomal elements (340 000 atoms). In a biased simulation of the entire ribosome with bound EF-Tu and three tRNAPhe units in the A/T, P/P, and E/E positions, the L1 stalk was pulled from a half-closed position to an open conformation within 3 ns, after extensive pre-equilibration. Pulling of the L1 stalk induced a movement of the E-site tRNA. Some of the atomistic models used in this work were constructed using molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) with primary cryo-EM data. This approach makes it possible to circumvent the lack of X-ray crystallography data for appropriate ribosomal states, and to model some mobile parts of the ribosome that are not resolved in the X-ray structures. The MDFF method was used for the pulling of the L1 stalk, targeting a partially resolved open
structure known from X-ray crystallography data.1039 It is useful to point out that resolution of cryo-EM studies has been
recently substantially enhanced, due to new technical enhance
ments.1047−1049
Obviously, when evaluating simulations of the whole ribosome, we should be much more tolerant with respect to the various limitations of MD than when considering simulations of small RNA systems. We suggest that the largest
uncertainty in such simulations does not relate to the choice of force field or the simulation time scale. Force-field artifacts are unlikely to fully develop on the simulations’ time scale, and should not propagate through the whole system. In the peripheral regions, these errors should only propagate slowly throughout the structure, while errors in the rigid core region are likely to be attenuated by the structure’s overall compactness. Thus, when studying the basic atomistic dynamics of such large systems, one can reasonably expect simulations to be pretty reliable. For large systems and short time scales, one can reasonably hope for a compensation of errors. Our general experience is that for larger systems, simulated for presently feasible time scales, force-field performance is often not as bad as for tetraloops (section 4.2) and tetranucleotides (section 4.1). In addition, whole-ribosome simulations do not attempt to capture folding, and remain within a given conformational basin of the studied structure. The simulation time scales achieved in the longest simulations should be sufficient to reveal many biologically relevant processes, especially when using well-chosen biases and enhanced sampling methods. The time scale of the ribosomal machine in operation (∼22 amino acids per second for elongation) is not fundamentally different from the time scale of simple base pair opening in a duplex. We assume that the true Achilles heel of accurate whole ribosome simulations is the unavoidable uncertainties in the starting structures, which result from experimental resolution limits and ensemble averaging. In addition, there are countless sources of potential errors such as missing residues, missing internal waters, incorrectly placed or missing monovalent and divalent ions, incorrect backbone substates, syn/anti nucleotide bias, and so on. It was shown that the omission of a single monovalent ion from the starting structure can entirely derail microsecondscale simulations of a fairly small protein/RNA complex (see
sections 4.7.1 and 4.7.10).508 This demonstrates the enormous sensitivity of MD simulations to the accuracy of the starting
structure,176,177 an issue often overlooked in the MD literature. Additionally, one should consider that a missing monovalent ion is a minor perturbation as compared to the omnipresent initial structural uncertainties that must be overcome when basing simulations on relatively low-resolution ribosomal X-ray structures.
4.7. Protein/RNA Complexes
4.7.1. Atomistic MD of Protein/RNA Complexes: General Considerations. MD simulations of protein/RNA complexes are inherently more difficult than simulations of the isolated monomers, and must be executed and evaluated with great care. Perhaps because of this difficulty, MD literature still includes only a rather small number of publications discussing studies on complexes of this sort even though RNA is almost
always bound to proteins in vivo.1050 Protein/RNA complexes are relatively large systems, and so are usually more computationally demanding to simulate than their constituent
monomers in isolation.508 However, the biggest barrier to atomistic simulations of protein/RNA complexes is often the unavailability of suitable experimental structures. For biologically interesting molecules, it is relatively common for the atomistic structures of one or both of the monomers (more often the protein) to be known, but not that of the
complex.1051 Some authors have sought to overcome this problem using various “docking” procedures, in which a knowledge-based approach is employed to derive a structure of the complex, which is then used as the starting structure for
Figure 52. Simulations of accommodation of A-site aa-tRNA from the
A/T state to the A/A state in a complete ribosome.1035 The figure shows overlap of spontaneous fluctuations achieved in explicit solvent MD (gray, ∼1.4 μs total sampling, ∼3 200 000 atoms, most of them belonging to the almost 1 million of water molecules) with a structurebased-atomistic-potential simulation probability distribution plot (color, ∼200 ms total sampling, ∼140 000 atoms). The twodimensional plot is built using two descriptors: RElbow is the distance between U47 of the incoming aa-tRNA and U8 of the P-site tRNA, while R3′ is the distance between A-site and P-site amino acids. Note that while the structure-based-potential simulations sample the whole space, the explicit-solvent MD trajectories remain localized around the starting structures; that is, they sample the A/T basin (upper left) and the A/A basin (lower right).

MD simulations. While this may be the only way to simulate protein/RNA complexes in the absence of an experimental structure, any building-up approach such as a docking procedure is a source of potentially critical errors that may
negatively affect the simulation results.1052 Upon formation of protein/RNA complex, significant local and global remodeling of both structures may occur. Indeed, given the known sensitivity of simulations of the protein/RNA complexes to the properties of the starting structures, we argue that docking procedures are not acceptable substitutes for atomistic structures in such cases.508 In other words, MD simulations of protein/RNA complexes that are not based on reliable experimental structures should only be performed under exceptional circumstances. Even if an experimental structure is available, there is no guarantee that it represents a suitable starting point for stable MD simulations, for a variety of reasons
that are discussed in detail elsewhere.154,508 Simulations of protein/RNA complexes are also more demanding in terms of the force-field balance: one may encounter force-field errors typical for the protein, the RNA, or both in the course of a single trajectory. In addition, the protein/RNA interface (the border between the interacting monomers) is necessarily subject to its own unique set of potential force-field imbalances. This is compounded by the fact that force-field parameters are developed separately for proteins and nucleic acids, so a reparameterization that improves simulations of isolated proteins or RNAs might not have the same beneficial impact at the protein/RNA interfaces. It is therefore not trivial to
assess force-field performance for simulations of protein/RNA complexes. The literature on simulations of protein/RNA complexes is quite fragmented, with few systematic studies on issues such as the performance of force fields for complexes or the preparation of starting structures. As is common in the MD literature, most works in this area do not acknowledge or discuss the problems that the authors encountered while performing the simulations, even when they attempt to draw substantial biochemical conclusions from the results obtained in those simulations. It is therefore not clear how reliable some results presented in the literature are, or whether the force fields used in some studies are even capable of correctly describing protein/RNA complexes. In 2015, Krepl et al. for the first time provided systematic benchmarking data for this field by simulating six structurally diverse protein/RNA complexes over multiple microsecondscale MD runs and evaluating the simulations’ stability, paying particular attention to the protein/RNA interface.508 Figure 53 presents the basic workflow these authors used when performing protein/RNA simulations. They tested the ff99SB1053 and ff12SB142 force fields for the protein components, and χOL3
94 for RNA, that is, the current stateof-the-art AMBER force fields. The generally positive conclusion of the work was that these force fields are mature enough to handle microsecond simulations of protein/RNA complexes in many cases. However, there were specific issues that had to be considered, and the possible simulation outcomes were remarkably variable: some systems yielded

Some systems may require additional actions to be taken. Note that running MD simulations of protein/RNA complexes based on PDB files without a careful preparation and analysis should be strictly avoided.

entirely stable trajectories in full agreement with the starting structures, while others yielded progressively degrading trajectories in every simulation that was attempted. For most systems, it was possible to achieve a good but imperfect agreement with the experimental structure. The differences between the simulations and experimental data were interpreted as resulting from an intricate mixture of force-field limitations and various factors related to the starting structures, which had to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Thus, there is no universal answer to the question: “How good or bad are MD simulations of protein/RNA complexes?” Every studied system must be judged individually, the simulations must be very carefully designed, and it is often necessary to regularly adapt the design of the study on the basis of preliminary results. The benchmark simulations suggested that with current force fields and simulation time scales the main limiting factors in simulations of protein/RNA complexes are the quality and properties of the experimental data used as initial structures. Many simulations were very sensitive to detailed aspects of the starting structures, which were often below the natural resolution/accuracy limits of the experimental data. It should be noted that these benchmark simulations were performed using a very carefully selected set of experimental structures that were expected to cause minimal uncertainties in the simulations. The results obtained by applying the same MD techniques to randomly chosen protein/RNA systems would probably be much less promising. The simulations were generally unable to resolve many common errors in the experimental structures, such as extensive crystal packing contacts or incorrectly refined sidechain rotamers of amino acids. These issues often only became apparent after significant simulation time (hundreds of nanoseconds). Even a small incompleteness in the starting structure such as a missing internally bound monovalent ion can dramatically destabilize the subsequent simulations. In addition, the behavior of the studied systems often differed across series of otherwise equivalent simulations, for a variety of reasons. It was thus necessary to perform multiple independent microsecond-scale simulations of each protein/RNA complex because single simulations or series of shorter simulations typically provided misleading results. Performing multiple microsecond-scale simulations and verifying that they all yield similar results does not guarantee convergence, but seems to represent the minimum required to obtain results that start to make sense for a wide range of systems. This implies that in many earlier studies, certain force-field issues and errors in experimental structures may have been misinterpreted as biologically significant developments. While such flaws are fully understandable in older studies whose authors did not have access to sufficient computational resources, contemporary and future studies should be extended at least to the abovenoted time scales. When basing simulations on NMR solution structures of protein/RNA complexes, some of these issues can be overcome through wise use of experimental data such as
NOE restraints to bias the simulations.346,368,1054,1055 The restraints can be applied during the initial phases of the simulations to stabilize them and then lifted, allowing the simulated complexes to settle and reducing the likelihood of
abrupt changes during the early stages of the simulations.368 We would like to stress that a prerequisite for successfully studying protein/RNA complexes is to first obtain basic microsecond-scale simulations of the experimental structures that are stable with the exception of local fluctuations. This
requirement is supported by the following argument. Healthy microsecond-scale simulations should not progressively corrupt the experimentally observed protein/RNA interface because
this would be incompatible with the lifetime or koff (often 10−2
s−1) of the real systems.1056 Therefore, large immediate distortions of the protein/RNA interfaces almost certainly indicate the presence of unacceptable errors in either the forcefield balance or the starting structures. Obviously, it would often be useful to see more of the system’s dynamics, but if this is the goal then one should complement the standard simulations with enhanced sampling simulation methods (section 3.2). Larger reconformations of the protein/RNA interfaces must be simulated in a controllable manner. On the basis of this argument, we consider the analyses of dynamics presented in many simulation-based papers on protein/RNA complexes to be suboptimal. The outcomes of simulations of protein/RNA complexes depend on the mode of protein/RNA recognition: different forms of protein/RNA recognition appear to have different degrees of compensation of errors in the force-field description. Our experience is that MD usually reproduces (i.e., keeps stable) protein/RNA binding that relies on shape recognition without complicated H-bonding. However, simulations of some protein/RNA complexes are unable to simultaneously satisfy all native H-bonds, especially for systems with dense networks of
protein/RNA H-bonds.508 We suggest that this results from imperfect descriptions of the individual H-bonds by the force field. This leads to a tension between the individual H-bonds that strains the protein/RNA interface in the force-field description, as all of the H-bonds try to satisfy the overall structure. During the early stages of the simulation, the simulated system responds to this stress by losing a few Hbonds, which relieves the structural strain and allows the simulation to progress steadily thereafter. This is a common obstacle in MD simulations of protein/RNA complexes. This view is supported by the fact that some of the systems can be stabilized using the HBfix potential function (sections 3.1.2.5
and 4.2.2.3),154 a local structure-specific bias that aims to compensate for the deficient description of H-bonds through
the use of pair-additive force fields.129 Perhaps, the structural stability of simulated protein/RNA complexes may also be sensitive to the exposure of the interface to the solvent. When simulating protein/RNA complexes, it is also important to keep in mind that the standard equilibration
protocol is less efficient than for small RNAs.154,508 The experimental structures are, for a variety of reasons, always high in force-field potential energy. Equilibration relaxes the simplest high-energy features in these structures, such as nonoptimal bond lengths and angles. However, the equilibrated structures may still be biased by more complex unnatural structural features such as inaccurate RNA backbone conformations, wrong protein side-chain orientations, unfilled internal hydration sites, and missing ions. These strains are transferred into the production simulations. Some simulations proceed to relax smoothly, dissipating the excess energy through many degrees of freedom, and continue stably. In other cases, the simulation is derailed by abrupt structural transitions. In an ideal case, given a flawless force field and unlimited simulation time, the MD method would ultimately resolve all such problems. However, in reality this typically leads to a confusing set of equivalent simulations with at first sight randomly
variable behavior.154,508 That is why we emphasize the need to perform series of simulations, and the usefulness of applying

NMR restraints during the initial stages of the production phase368 when performing simulations based on NMR structures, although it should be noted that common restraining potentials can sometimes also influence the simulated ensemble in an undesired manner.1057 Manual modification of the starting structure is sometimes necessary, as demonstrated by the example of the Sam domain of the Vts1 complex. This experimental structure required removal of an overhanging nucleotide and stabilization of the end of the RNA stem by GC base pairs, because excessive end-fraying of the RNA stem end destabilized the complex, despite that the stem end was not initially in a physical contact with the protein. This modification yielded neat simulations in which all of the important interfacial H-bonds were satisfied.508
The benchmark simulations508 revealed that the ff12SB142 protein force field is an improvement over the ff99SB. Additionally, the χOL3
94 parameters provided an adequate description for RNA, achieving accuracies compatible with previously established limits.508 It was later observed that the ff14SB142 protein force field may be (at least as implemented in the AMBER program package in the time of writing this Review) slightly inferior to ff12SB in simulations of protein/ RNA complexes. This is due to a lower energy barrier for phenylalanine and tyrosine side-chain rotation, which allows for excessive fluctuations of these side-chains in ff14SB simulations and can perturb some protein/RNA complexes. An identical
issue was observed in simulations using the older ff99SB parameters. The ff12SB parameters address this issue by doubling the size of the energy barrier, which significantly reduced the number of aromatic side-chain flips.508 Somewhat surprisingly and for unknown reasons, this refinement was not carried over to the ff14SB parameters, leading to an observed regression in the ff14SB simulations.154,369 Below, we provide an overview of the MD simulation studies on protein/RNA systems that are available in the literature. Despite all of the limitations noted above, we believe that MD simulations of RNAs complexed with proteins will represent a major area of research involving RNA simulations over the next decade. Although not every protein/RNA system can be satisfactorily simulated, the vast and rich world of protein/RNA interactions guarantees that there will always be a lot of material for meaningful simulations. However, to avoid discrediting the MD method by populating the literature with poorly executed and interpreted simulations, it will be necessary for researchers working in this field to uphold certain standards when performing simulations, to provide full details of their methods, and to avoid overinterpreting their results.

simulations finally allowed one to observe full spontaneous transition between open, semiopen, and closed conformations of the C-terminal helix.1071 Figure partially adapted from ref 1071. Copyright 2015 American Chemical Society.
