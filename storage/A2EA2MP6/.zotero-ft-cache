ABSTRACT: Transition-metal complexes are attractive targets for the design of catalysts and functional materials. The behavior of the metal−organic bond, while very tunable for achieving target properties, is challenging to predict and necessitates searching a wide and complex space to identify needles in haystacks for target applications. This review will focus on the techniques that make high-throughput search of transition-metal chemical space feasible for the discovery of complexes with desirable properties. The review will cover the development, promise, and limitations of “traditional” computational chemistry (i.e., force field, semiempirical, and density functional theory methods) as it pertains to data generation for inorganic molecular discovery. The review will also discuss the opportunities and limitations in leveraging experimental data sources. We will focus on how advances in statistical modeling, artificial intelligence, multiobjective optimization, and automation accelerate discovery of lead compounds and design rules. The overall objective of this review is to showcase how bringing together advances from diverse areas of computational chemistry and computer science have enabled the rapid uncovering of structure−property relationships in transition-metal chemistry. We aim to highlight how unique considerations in motifs of metal−organic bonding (e.g., variable spin and oxidation state, and bonding strength/nature) set them and their discovery apart from more commonly considered organic molecules. We will also highlight how uncertainty and relative data scarcity in transition-metal chemistry motivate specific developments in machine learning representations, model training, and in computational chemistry. Finally, we will conclude with an outlook of areas of opportunity for the accelerated discovery of transition-metal complexes.

1. INTRODUCTION
Transition-metal complexes have properties that can be carefully tuned through ligand design and metal selection for the control of spin/oxidation state and electronic or optical properties. As a result, tailoring the properties of transitionmetal complexes has led to significant advances in catalysis and in the design of functional (e.g., magnetic) materials. Computational chemistry and, in particular, quantum chemical modeling have long played essential roles in explaining structure−property relationships and in designing this class of inorganic molecules. More recently, the accelerated discovery and design of transition-metal complexes has greatly benefitted from developments in accelerated computer hardware, larger data sets from theory and experiment, and machine learning models. Advances in artificial intelligence are changing all areas of chemistry at an increasingly rapid pace, and the combinatorial challenges of metal−organic bonding at open-shell transition-metal centers make this materials space particularly ripe for data-driven, accelerated methods.
1.1. Scope of the Review
This review focuses on cases where computational chemistry and machine learning play a leading role in accelerated inorganic complex discovery. To understand this role, we address the intersection of developments in electronic structure theory, molecular modeling, cheminformatics, and
machine learning. To describe progress in large-scale automation of transition-metal chemical space exploration, we consider efforts in both experimental and computational high-throughput screening. We also address specific challenges for open-shell, first-row (i.e., 3d) transition-metal chemistry in terms of data availability and reliability, both from conventional computational modeling and from experiment. We touch briefly upon heavier elements (i.e., with open 4d, 5d, or lanthanide 4f shells), but the discussion is more limited in scope, in part due to the smaller amount of available experimental data. This review highlights recent developments over the past few years in machine learning models capable of reproducing electronic structure property predictions at low cost in highthroughput screening and accelerated discovery in transitionmetal chemistry. It discusses closely related efforts in data mining, semiempirical modeling, and molecular mechanics over the past 50 years. This discussion is necessary to provide context on where machine learning models can supersede or, alternatively, learn from these methods. Other topics in the scope of this review include data-driven efforts in extracting quantities from experimental literature or in developing linear quantitative structure−property and scaling relationships from experimental and literature data. The central focus of this review is on methods and software for property prediction and accelerated chemical discovery in metal−organic complexes and closely related materials (e.g., porous metal−organic frameworks), at the interface with more traditional domains of electronic structure theory. Other inorganic materials, such as most solid-state materials or biological systems (e.g., metalloenzymes) are not discussed. This review also largely excludes the special considerations associated with neural network potentials and representations for carrying out molecular dynamics. Where we cover catalytic applications, our emphasis is on the design of catalysts rather than on the discovery of reaction mechanisms.
1.2. Previous Reviews
Several previous reviews have been written that are of broad use to the reader and provide complementary discussions of
topics not extensively covered in this review. Li and Merz1 have written a comprehensive review of molecular modeling
for metal ion bonding. Pidko and co-workers2 have extensively discussed the combined computational and experimental considerations for transition-metal catalysis. Fey and co
workers3 have examined the relationship between chemical properties and relevant descriptors from cheminformatics for interpreting the properties of transition-metal complexes. Jensen and co-workers recently discussed some of the
challenges for in silico catalyst design.4 A number of reviews have addressed specific challenges of density functional theory
(DFT) in its application to transition-metal chemistry5−7 as
well as opportunities for going beyond DFT in catalysis.8 Additional reviews are mentioned in the context of specific topics, as noted in relevant sections throughout this review.
1.3. Note on Machine Learning Nomenclature
This review is written primarily from the perspective of computational and theoretical chemistry with some reference to concepts from chemical bonding and transition-metal chemistry as well as related experimental data. Applications of machine learning will be introduced with some needed background, but concepts behind the terminology may be less familiar to a reader without prior exposure to machine learning.

To understand machine learning’s relevance to transition-metal complex discovery, we will primarily discuss key aspects of statistical machine learning. We will discuss descriptors or features, which are the inputs to machine learning models. We will address supervised learning, where the model learns the mapping between inputs and outputs (here, property prediction). This review will also introduce applications of unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, where the model chooses the structure of data without being provided any (or most) property output labels. The review will cover models of varying complexity or interpretability and what role model choice plays in discovery. This review will discuss how researchers determine when machine learning models are confident, in an area of statistical learning known as uncertainty quantification. This aids in the identification of model domain of applicability, which refers to where a machine learning model should be applied. The model can either be exploited by being used only in its domain of applicability, or we can engage in model exploration, preferentially acquiring promising data in regions of high uncertainty. Finally, we will address some efforts focused on addressing scarce or biased data, including through so-called active learning approaches that iteratively seek out new information for machine learning models. For additional background on the fundamental statistical learning concepts beyond the scope of this review, we suggest consulting reference texts, such as The Elements of Statistical
Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman9 or the recent primer developed by Janet and Kulik for applications of
machine learning in chemistry.10
2. MOLECULAR MODELING FOR TRANSITION-METAL CHEMISTRY
There has long been significant interest in developing tractable, low-cost computational models of transition-metal complexes. The special challenges arising from the diverse range of bonding, spin, and oxidation states in open-shell transitionmetal complexes have limited the development of general,
accurate models. Nevertheless, semiempirical11−14 and classical
molecular mechanics15−20 models have been developed for understanding the properties of transition-metal complexes, particularly prior to the advent of practical density functional theory (DFT) functionals and wide applicability of DFT through increases in computational power in the 1990s. The
earliest extended Huckel21 and other semiempirical Hamil
tonian11−14 calculations on transition-metal complexes were carried out over 60 years ago. This section describes developments in both force field (section 2.1) and semiempirical (section 2.2) methods along with advancements and obstacles in the theory and practice of DFT (section 2.3). Challenges for correlated wave function theory (WFT) methods specific to transition-metal chemistry (section 2.4) are also briefly reviewed. This section concludes with a brief description of how statistical learning methods and molecular modeling methods have been simultaneously leveraged and where opportunities remain.
2.1. Force Fields
Despite the somewhat decreased focus on molecular mechanics force field methods in recent years, affordable but reasonably accurate tools for structure generation and property prediction are often needed for efficient computational workflows. While many force fields and semiempirical theories were primarily developed for main group chemistry, a number
of semiempirical methods22−25 or force fields16,17,26−28 were developed with transition-metal chemistry in mind. The best performance is typically obtained by focusing on a subset of
properties (e.g., structure25 or spectra22) or materials.29,30 Here, we briefly review some of the key historical advances in force field development with a focus on open-shell transitionmetal chemistry.
2.1.1. General-Purpose Force Field Modeling. Force fields capable of predicting properties across the periodic table
have been devised.26,31−33 The most widely used and wellknown of these that is suitable for transition-metal chemistry is
the universal force field (UFF).26 In UFF, a heuristic set of rules based on mixing of elements and on Badger’s rules for relating bond length and strength enables the generation of parameters for a large number of elements. For transitionmetal complexes, the ability of UFF to predict experimental metal−ligand bond lengths varies from good (0.02 Å) to fair
(ca. 0.08 Å) or poor, with average errors around 0.05 Å20 to
0.10 Å.34 For open-shell transition-metal chemistry in particular, it is problematic that a single oxidation and spin
state is used in parameter generation for each metal,26 and the force field may not be accurate for alternative oxidation or spin
states (Figure 1).34,35 The appropriate bond order for metal−
ligand interactions must also be manually adjusted for ligands that involve backbonding (e.g., carbonyl or phosphine) to
avoid over- or underestimating bond lengths.20 To overcome some limitations, these general force fields have been specifically tailored for common materials targets in inorganic chemistry such as porous metal−organic framework
(MOF) materials (i.e., with UFF4MOF29). The MM336 force field of Allinger and co-workers is another widely used generalpurpose force field. It incorporates Morse potentials for bond stretching to better describe distorted structures. In a similar spirit to the tailoring of UFF, a number of groups have manually adjusted the MM3 parameters for a narrow range of
Figure 1. Comparison of relationships between bond length and chemical composition in organic molecules (top) and inorganic chemistry (bottom) obtained from UFF (circles) to those from DFT (vertical lines). For organic chemistry, the lengths of C−C bonds in acetylene, ethylene, benzene, and ethane are compared. For inorganic chemistry, the Fe−C bond in four spin and oxidation states of the homoleptic Fe(CO)6 complex are compared. The relative bond
lengths obtained from first-principles calculation are shown to scale across the two data sets: the organic molecules span a 0.34 Å range from acetylene (1.20 Å) to ethane (1.54 Å), and the inorganic complex bond lengths span a 0.37 Å range from singlet Fe(II) (1.94 Å) to quintet Fe(II) (2.31 Å).

transition-metal complexes15 or materials (e.g., for MOFs with
MOF-FF30). To make this approach straightforward, a number
of groups have employed genetic algorithms (GAs)19,30,37 to optimize metal-specific force field parameters. It is challenging for any of these general force fields to describe the relative stability of isomers, e.g., tetrahedral versus square planar complexes. To address this limitation, Landis and co-workers developed a Fourier series approach to
handling angular potentials in the SHAPES38 and VAL
BOND27,39,40 force fields. These force fields address the fact that there are multiple minima in the L−M−L angular potential (e.g., 90° and 180° for an octahedral complex) and achieve bond length errors ca. 0.01−0.03 Å on training complexes or up to 0.1 Å for some higher-error points. Recent
extensions by Meuwly28 were added to predict other electronically driven features (i.e., trans influence, see section 2.1.2). Other efforts to tailor force fields to describe aspects of metal−ligand bonding include adaptations for the Jahn−Teller
effect18,41 and the trans effect.42 A more thorough discussion of some of these considerations, especially for bioinorganic systems, is carried out in refs 1 and 19. A critical outstanding area is in the generation of conformers, where even for organic molecules a force field conformer ranking often differs from that of more accurate
methods.43 In catalysis, this can be critical, as choosing a different conformer for a reaction can change predicted
activation energies.44,45 For transition-metal chemistry, the question of how to address the metal−ligand bond (i.e., with
fixed bond order or nonbonded, electrostatic terms)46 adds additional challenges to assessing and improving force field accuracy as well. For conformer searching and other tasks where standard force fields fail but higher-level methods remain costprohibitive, a divide-and-conquer approach may be useful. Errors from general molecular mechanics force fields are dramatically smaller on organic components of transition-metal
complexes than on the metal−organic bond (Figure 2).34 Thus, in one strategy, the metal and its coordinating atoms are
described with QM, whereas the organic components are treated with a force field and allowed to move during the
conformer search.47 Another family of approaches called hierarchically improved methods, in which the structure is preoptimized with a force field or semiempirical method (see section 2.2) and then refined with DFT (see section 2.3), has frequently been pursued in transition-metal chemistry (Figure
3).48,49 More recent developments include systematic con
struction, e.g., from fragments from the Cambridge Structural
Database (CSD)50,51 (see section 5) or databases of DFT
data.52,53 In combination with machine learning model
predictions,54,55 these approaches have emerged as preferable alternatives (see section 4).
2.1.2. Ligand Field Effects and Molecular Mechanics Models. The ligand field molecular mechanics (LFMM)
approach first introduced in the 1990s16 incorporates a distance-dependent ligand field stabilization energy (LFSE) into the force field that attempts to model the crystal field splitting. Each individual metal−ligand interaction is parametrized using standard terms (e.g., stretch, bend, torsion, van
der Waals) along with a ligand field stabilization interaction.17 Notably, LFMM derives its terms from the widely employed empirical Hamiltonian approach known as the angular overlap
model (AOM) that was first introduced in the 1960s.56 In the AOM approach, sparse matrix elements describing the ligand field are parametrized based on experimental structural and spectroscopic data. These methods then aid the interpretation of spectroscopic observations. Accurate structures are important inputs into the AOM model for prediction of
spectroscopic properties.57 Comba and co-workers developed
the multilevel MM-AOM57 approach for cases where an accurate experimental structure is unknown for input into the AOM model. In MM-AOM, a molecular mechanics force field
parametrized58,59 to reproduce structures of relevant compounds (e.g., Co(III) ammines) is applied to the molecules being studied. One key feature of the AOM model and the related LFMM approach is the assumption of additivity of
ligand field effects.60 By comparing the ability of AOM models to predict experimental spectra, the qualitative assumption of
ligand field additivity was confirmed,60 although minor exceptions can be noted.

In recent years, LFMM has become the most widely used implementation of AOM within MM-based modeling. The
LFMM field-splitting parameters for σ and π bonding17 are tuned to reproduce a combination of experimental structural
data from the CSD and DFT-calculated distances,61 typically for a narrow range of spin and oxidation states (e.g., Ni(II) or
Cu(II)16 and Fe(II)61). As a result of inclusion of the LFSE term, LFMM can be parametrized to predict spin-state
energies,61,62 the preferred coordination geometry of a given
spin or oxidation state,63 ligand exchange or dissociation
energies,64 and the presence of Jahn−Teller distortions.16,41 Training errors on structural properties are typically small in these models for a single set of force field terms (around 0.01−
0.02 Å), but application to diverse test molecules61 can yield larger errors of ca. 0.06−0.10 Å. LFMM-like terms have also been added to polarizable force fields (i.e., in SIBFA-LF) to
enable modeling of Jahn−Teller distortions.65 The LFMM parameters must be determined for each metal, oxidation, spin state, and ligand field strength, but the developed parameters can be used in a way that exploits ligand additivity. For example, LFMM parameters derived from homoleptic complexes can reproduce general trends of some
heteroleptic compounds,62 as exemplified by tests on the spin
splitting energies of Co(III)(F−)n(CN−)6−n complexes (Figure
4). The mixed LFMM parameters overestimate the effect of
each ligand addition on the spin splitting with respect to DFT, but they are able to capture subtle differences in cis versus trans or fac versus mer isomers (Figure 4). While implemented in a number of codes (e.g., Tinker and
DommiMOE),63,66 widespread adoption of the LFMM approach has predominantly been limited by the lack of demonstrated general performance of the parameter set. Nevertheless, promising directions of the LFMM approach include recent improvements in automated optimization of parameters. Using multiobjective optimization with a genetic algorithm, Deeth and co-workers simultaneously minimized standard LFMM parameter spin-splitting energy errors (ca. 1− 7 kcal/mol) and metal−ligand bond length errors (ca. 0.02− 0.03 Å) with respect to DFT (i.e., with the OPBE functional)
results for Fe(II) complexes, including spin-crossover (SCO)
complexes.61 These continued methodological developments of LFMM have led to applications that include modeling
host−guest interactions of water in SCO Fe(II) MOFs.67
Using LFMM, Paesani and co-workers67 performed molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to observe changes in the spin-crossover transition of a Fe(II) SCO MOF in the presence of additional water molecules in the unit cell that alter the ligand field environment around the Fe(II) metal (Figure 5). Other recent extensions of LFMM have been developed for
metalloenzyme modeling.68
2.1.3. Alternative Tailored Force Fields for Transition States. Thus far, we have described a number of cases where specific force field parameters are developed for a narrow range of metals and materials in their equilibrium structures. Transition states play a critical role in transition-metal catalyst design, motivating a special example of force fields tailored to optimize and characterize saddle points. The transition-state force field (TSFF) approach was pioneered by Houk and co
workers69 and popularized by Norrby, Wiest, and co
workers70,71 through combination with systematic parametrization. For the TSFF family of approaches, a force field is generally fit to the quantum mechanical (i.e., DFT) Hessian of
a known transition state that is the target for ligand design.72 The negative eigenvalue of this Hessian is shifted to become positive such that a minimization algorithm normally used for geometry optimization locates the transition state. While parametrized on the transition state for a single ligand, this approach can then be used to screen a large number of ligands or carry out conformational searches in the TS geometry. Chief limitations here are the difficulty of accurately parametrizing the force field and the prediction of changes in
steric contributions along the reaction coordinate.70 Norrby and co-workers have focused on identifying optimal parametrization objectives and weightings as well as systematic, automated optimization of this objective from quantum data in

the Q2MM approach.73 Despite potential limitations in the TSFF formalism including sensitivity to parametrization, these methods have been shown to successfully discern vanishingly small energetic differences between ligands that are needed to
predict enantiomeric excess.71 The predictive capabilities of Q2MM/TSFF on experimental enantioselectivities also suggests they may be able to identify errors in reported
experimental values.74 Alternative methods to the TSFF for characterizing transition states at low cost are summarized in ref 72.
2.2. Semi-empirical Methods
Over the past 50−60 years, semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods have been developed and applied to the study
of transition-metal complexes.11−14,21 As in organic chemistry
where these methods are most well developed,75−77 early developments included parametrization with the complete
neglect of differential overlap (CNDO),78,79 followed by improvements through less severe approximations in the
intermediate neglect of differential overlap (INDO),23,80−84
and neglect of differential diatomic overlap (NDDO)76,85 flavors of semiempirical theory. Semiempirical methods were most widely used following their development in the 1970s− 1980s prior to the advent of predictive DFT methodology. Nevertheless, the need for rapid structural preoptimization prior to DFT calculations, especially in data-driven workflows, as well as possible improvements arising from larger available data sets and more sophisticated parametrizations, have motivated their continued development.
2.2.1. Early SQM Methods. While SQM methods have long been demonstrated for main group chemistry, special considerations are needed for handling d electrons. INDO, which includes one-center exchange integrals neglected in CNDO, can be expected to be the minimum level of theory capable of capturing essential aspects of transition-metal chemistry, such as d−d orbital ordering and transition
characteristics.82 The most successful demonstration of these
early methods were Zerner’s INDO23 and INDO/S22,86 techniques for predicting ground-state and spectral properties
(e.g., vertical spin transition energies87 of [Fe(H2O)6]3+). These methods were applied on static structures of open-shell transition-metal complexes, typically obtained from experiment. Highly successful semiempirical methods developed for
organic molecules (e.g., the PM6 and PM7 methods88,89 or
AM190) have modifications (e.g., AM1/d or PM3(tm))91,92 to enable treatment of d electrons. Nevertheless, benchmarking of these methods on first-row transition-metal complexes has
been limited and not very promising.76,93,94 The most glaring limitations of semiempirical methods are the inability to
predict the existence of stable structures93,94 and the prediction of the incorrect ordering preference of conformers with respect to DFT benchmarks (Figure 6). Other observed errors for SQM methods include incorrect
metal−ligand bond lengths (by ca. 0.1 Å94), incorrect ground
state spin prediction,95 and both over- and underestimation of
ligand dissociation energies.76 When tested on MOF crystal lattice optimizations, PM6 and PM7 generally underestimate lattice parameters by around 0.5−1.0 Å (ca. 3%) even for
relatively simple (e.g., Mg-MOF-74) materials.96 In comparison to 3d metals and main group elements, few parameter sets
have been developed for 4d or 5d transition metals.83,97,98 Poor performance for metal−ligand bond lengths (ca. 0.1 Å on 48 training compounds) for an INDO-based model was attributed
to the inflexibility of parameters derived to reproduce atomic
ionization energies.83 Unlike in organic chemistry, errors for semiempirical methods in transition-metal chemistry are overall unsuitably
large.76,93 Parameterizations of these methods typically involve fitting to experimental atomic data as well as to metal−ligand bond distances from experimental structures of mononuclear
complexes.99 However, the lack of explicit encoding of the effect of ligand properties (i.e., field strength or contributions beyond the direct coordinating atoms) has limited the predictive capabilities of these methods. The application and performance of semiempirical theory to polynuclear transitionmetal complex properties (e.g., exchange coupling) has been
even less extensively explored.100 For example, Reiher and co
workers76 showed that PM688 or PM789 ligand dissociation energies not only over- or underestimate the dissociation energies from local coupled cluster theory references by as much as 150 kJ/mol (40 kcal/mol) but also that modest changes from PM6 to PM7 parametrization significantly increase the errors (ca. 10 kcal/mol or more) for some compounds (Figure 7). The current parameter sets are unlikely to be sufficiently flexible to eliminate these errors. Detailed, critical reviews of developments and remaining limitations for semiempirical theory are provided in refs 76, 77, and 99. The best performance has been obtained when the semiempirical parameters for the metal center were optimized systematically (i.e., with a genetic algorithm) on experimental
(i.e., CSD structure) data for a specific metal (e.g., Tc101) and/
or application (e.g., Ru dyes102) to achieve errors on the order of 0.02−0.04 Å in metal−ligand bond lengths. For example, by both focusing on a narrow range of materials and reoptimizing the Ru parameters in PM6, metal−ligand bond length errors were reduced from 0.04 Å to less than 0.02 Å on molecules
both in and held back from the training set.102

1990s, due to the demanding nature of DFT at the time, remain relevant for modern uses of semiempirical methods for geometry preoptimization in high-throughput workflows. These authors proposed the de novo structure prediction approach of MM-then-SQM-then-DFT, occasionally requiring some retracing of steps in the hierarchy to ensure all minima were located in conformational searches (Figure 3). However, the large geometric errors typically observed with early semiempirical methods present a barrier to their use in modern workflows. Improvements in the treatment of noncovalent interactions and thermochemistry, e.g., with the orthogonalization-corrected OMx methods of Thiel and coworkers,103 have not been extended to transition-metal chemistry. Readily available semiempirical methods (e.g., PM688 or PM789) sometimes optimize structures to the incorrect coordination environment favored by a metal, but constraining the local coordination environment does not generally improve prediction accuracy.93
These challenges have motivated the development by Grimme and co-workers of the GFN-xTB series of semiempirical methods better suited to the prediction of
structures25,104 of large transition-metal complexes. The GFN-xTB family generally outperforms PM6 and PM7 variants (Figure 8). However, these newer SQM methods have some
limitations, in that they cannot predict spin-state energetics,75 and they generally perform poorly for predicting properties of
open-shell transition-metal complexes such as pKas105 or redox
potentials.106 For use in characterizing transition states, the GFN-xTB methods slightly outperform PM6 or PM7 on prediction of barrier heights and structures with respect to
DFT reference values on the MOBH35 set107 (Figure 9). Nevertheless, GFN-xTB cannot locate some transition states and others have significantly different geometries (ca. 0.5−1 Å RMSD) or energies (ca. 10−30 kcal/mol) in comparison to
DFT reference values (Figure 9).107 GFN-xTB methods are related to self-consistent charge (SCC) density functional tight binding (DFTB) techniques.

SCC-DFTB methods represent a distinct family of semiempirical techniques based on reproducing results from DFT
in the context of a minimal basis.24,108,109 Because the method is largely parametrized to reproduce results from semilocal DFT, it can suffer from the same challenges as DFT in describing transition-metal complexes (see section 2.3). Nevertheless, parameters have been developed for some
transition metals with DFTB (e.g., Ni,110 Cu,111 and earlier
3d transition metals112). Reasonably promising results have been obtained especially for structural properties of transitionmetal complexes (ca. 0.06−0.10 Å errors), but energetic errors are still significant (ca. 10−20 kcal/mol or higher), especially
for charged ligands.110,112 More parameters, including those that can account for multiple spin and oxidation states in a balanced fashion, are needed to make DFTB a generally useful tool.
2.3. Density Functional Theory Modeling
While the theoretical groundwork for density functional theory (DFT) was first developed over 50 years ago, development of accurate functionals and increases in computing power in the 1990s led to its rapid adoption for application to transition
metal chemistry. Much like for the MM and SQM theories that preceded it, special considerations must be made in the application of DFT to transition metals. In this section, we briefly review the most relevant theoretical challenges (section 2.3.1) and practical performance (section 2.3.2) of conventional DFT functionals in this domain. We also describe the most widely employed semiempirical corrections to DFT that have been developed specifically for transition-metal chemistry (section 2.3.3).
2.3.1. Theoretical Challenges for Conventional DFT Functionals. Although DFT is widely employed for its balance of cost and accuracy in main group chemistry, most exchange-correlation (xc) approximations in DFT suffer from
one- and many-electron self-interaction errors.113−117 The selfinteraction error has been associated with a number of missing constraints in DFT, including the lack of piecewise linearity or derivative discontinuity with respect to electron removal, which leads to underestimations of fundamental gaps and
incorrect hybridization.118−120 As reviewed elsewhere (e.g., in refs 6, 121, and 122), a popular approach to improving DFT accuracy in main group methods is to systematically incorporate higher-order terms in an expansion of the density, which have been described as rungs on a Jacob’s ladder to chemical accuracy heaven, while satisfying constraints on model systems or against experimental data. This paradigm is challenged in open-shell transition-metal chemistry. The partially filled d shell is strongly sensitive to both absolute self-interaction error, also referred to as delocalization
error,113,123 as well as imbalances in delocalization across a reaction coordinate. Exchange-correlation functionals that reduce delocalization
error tend to increase the static correlation error124−126 (i.e., poor treatment of multideterminantal solutions), important for
transition-metal chemistry, with few exceptions.126−130 Recommendations of best-in-class functionals for transition-metal chemistry differ from the main group: pure semilocal generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) tend to be
favored131 in transition-metal chemistry when static correlation error is manifest, whereas hybrid GGAs and “higher rung” functionals are typically believed to improve over GGAs for organic molecules. Similarly, DFT errors are often significantly larger in transition-metal chemistry, and practical correction schemes tend to differ from those used in main group chemistry.
2.3.2. Practical Performance on Structures and Energetic Properties. Some properties are disproportionately sensitive to self-interaction errors in DFT functionals. For
example, adiabatic spin-state splitting,132−139 barrier
heights,140,141 frontier orbital energies, and absorption
spectra142−144 are all very sensitive to functional choice. For complexes that are known to exhibit near-degenerate spin states (i.e., spin-crossover complexes or SCOs), incorporating a significant amount of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange usually biases functionals toward overpredicting high-spin (HS) ground states, whereas semilocal functionals predict too
many complexes to have low-spin (LS) ground states.132−139
Isomerization or conformer energies145,146 as well as ligand
dissociation energies147 represent an intermediate case for sensitivity to self-interaction error, generally increasing when there is an imbalance in the degree of delocalization between
intermediates.148 Most observations have been made on 3d complexes, and comparatively less is known about the relative accuracy of electronic structure methods for 4d com

plexes.149−151 However, a combination of the strong low-spin shift of 4d metals with respect to their 3d counterparts and the more diffuse nature of orbitals suggests that some properties that are normally quite sensitive to functional choice (i.e., spinsplitting energies) in 3d metals are considerably less sensitive
with 4d metals.152 Experimental gas-phase ligand dissociation energies from primarily closed-shell, late transition-metal (Cu, Pd, Ru, Pt, and Ag) complexes were collected by Reiher and co-workers in
the WCCR10 data set.147 The WCCR10 set was designed to isolate potential effects of a condensed-phase environment on ligand dissociation energies. The errors obtained with DFT functionals on this set are moderate (ca. 20−40 kJ/mol or 5−
10 kcal/mol),147 outside the reported error margin of the
experiments. Reiher and co-workers153 also evaluated these ligand dissociation energies with more accurate DLPNO
CCSD(T)154 reference energies and used diagnostics of multireference character (MR) to estimate when the DLPNO-CCSD(T) results should be most trustworthy. They found that discrepancies between DLPNO-CCSD(T) and experiment persisted in these cases, suggesting some
uncertainty in the experimental interpretation.153 In choosing a DFT functional that reproduced DLPNO-CCSD(T), PBE0
with a D3 dispersion correction was the best performer,153 albeit not agreeing particularly well with all experimental
results.147 Recent tests on 151 transition-metal complex and
small-molecule reaction energies known as TMC151,155 which
is a superset of previously proposed test sets,156−158 have also favored dispersion-corrected functionals but in combination with range-separated hybrids. Structures obtained from geometry optimizations (i.e., local minima) are generally less sensitive to DFT functional than many other properties. Exceptions to this tend to occur only for isomers with small energetic differences that are sensitive to delocalization imbalances and can lead to method disagree
ment.145,159 A representative example of where delocalization errors from DFT can influence structure is in the inserted dioxide structure of transition metal dioxides, which progresses from bent to linear experimentally across the first-row transition metals. Semilocal GGAs predict all structures to be
bent146,159 in contrast with CCSD(T) or experiment, whereas
delocalization corrections (i.e., DFT+U159 or hybrids146) tend to improve structures (Figure 10). The most abundant source of geometric data is structures obtained from X-ray diffraction of molecular complexes in the crystal field of surrounding ions and complexes (e.g., that are
deposited in the CSD160). The condensed-phase, crystalline environment could be expected to be distinct from the in vacuo calculations used to benchmark DFT. Thus, the effect of an implicit solvent on DFT structures has been directly probed161 and found to be influential, particularly for complexes with a mixture of ionic ligands. As an alternative,
Bühl and co-workers131,150,162 collected structures from gasphase neutron diffraction for which more direct comparisons
could be made. The data sets for these 3d,162 4d,150 and 5d131 transition-metal complexes were comparatively modest in size (ca. 20−30 complexes). Across all transition-metal complexes, most functionals overestimated bond lengths, but errors were modest for all cases, and several pure GGA functionals (e.g.,
PBE or BP86) performed well.131 This divergence suggests that DFT should provide suitable structures even when energetics cannot be predicted, whereas force fields or
semiempirical methods93 may not be sufficient for structural predictions.
2.3.3. Semi-empirical Corrections to DFT. A number of semiempirical, albeit physically motivated, corrections have been developed and applied as additive corrections for deficiencies in DFT functionals in a manner that is not dissimilar from SQM theories. While several, such as empirical dispersion corrections, are widely used across the periodic table, we focus here on those that have been developed especially for open-shell transition metals. Corrections are often motivated here by the need to address self-interaction errors to which open-shell (e.g., 3d) electrons tend to be disproportionately sensitive. The so-called LDA+U or DFT+U
approach,163−165 which is reviewed in refs 6 and 166, is one
such method. While introduced for the solid state,163−165 DFT +U was later demonstrated for open-shell transition-metal molecules.6,142,167 DFT+U incorporates a Hubbard U correction term to localized (e.g., 3d) states. This correction
can be calculated from the electronic structure167−170 but is
more frequently tuned171−173 to reproduce target properties. Because of this association, we classify DFT+U as a semiempirical correction despite having desirable fundamental origins in the Hubbard model and demonstrating the ability to recover169 exact conditions (e.g., the derivative discontinuity,118 Figure 11). The limits of DFT+U in practice are that while it can improve some properties (e.g., band gaps or spinstate ordering), it may do so at the cost of worsening others (e.g., geometries) due to the limited flexibility of a single parameter applied to the 3d states.

A promising, holistic empirical approach is Friesner and co
workers’ DBLOC method.174−176 Force-field-like energy corrections, which depend on the metal and electron configuration (i.e., spin and oxidation state) as well as the ligand field strength, are added to DFT (typically B3LYP) energetics. The DBLOC method has been demonstrated to
correct hybrid B3LYP DFT spin-splitting177 or redox proper
ties178 (Figure 12). The approach’s empiricism comes in part from the least-squares minimization of errors to obtain
parameters177 that increase correspondence between hybrid DFT properties and curated experimental training data (e.g.,
57 spin-splitting energies177 or 95 redox potentials178). The total parameter set (ca. 5−12 per metal/ligand combina
tion177,178) can approach the size of the available training set. Given the limited training data, bondwise corrections due to
ligand field strength are thus assumed to be additive60 and also classified only in terms of a weak, intermediate, or strong
ligand field.176,177 The DBLOC approach reduces absolute errors on both
training and test177 molecules as well as the standard deviation of errors with respect to curated experimental data sets, for example, reducing B3LYP MAEs on redox potentials from 0.4
to 0.12 V178 (Figure 12). In addition to spin splitting or redox, the method has also been demonstrated on ligand dissociation
energies,179 overall typically reducing errors from moderate
values (ca. 4179 to 9178 kcal/mol) to near-chemical accuracy
(ca. 1−3 kcal/mol). It has been noted that DBLOC can more systematically reduce errors for few-parameter functionals in
comparison to more complex DFT functionals.180 Nevertheless, the method has not reached widespread use due in part
to the difficulty with obtaining parameters or training data.176 A common systematic, albeit empirical, approach is to optimize DFT functional parameters for specific DFT
properties such as redox potential181 or spin-splitting
energy.182 In these approaches, the optimal exchange fraction is typically sought by minimizing error with respect to experiment, leading to distinct values (e.g., 12% in
B4XLYP181 or 15% in B3LYP*182) from the parent functional and decreasing errors (e.g., ca. 0.05−0.06 V in redox
potential181) on test molecules. While tailoring the HF
exchange fraction181,182 has been demonstrated to work well when optimizing for a single class of materials and properties, e.g., spin-splitting energies of Fe(II)/N spin-crossover
complexes,182 this approach can fail across broader ranges of
materials.133,177 The optimal exchange fraction in a hybrid GGA or meta-GGA is strongly metal- or ligand-dependent in
spin-state ordering (Figure 13).135,136,138,139,182−186 Differences in exchange sensitivity for ligand dissociation energies or steps in a catalytic cycle create additional complications for typically studied properties of transition-metal com
plexes.148,187 One type of physically motivated tuning (i.e., like DFT+U) is the use of optimally tuned range-separated
hybrids,188−190 wherein the range-separation parameter for incorporating HF exchange is used to eliminate deviations from piecewise linearity for each specific molecule with some
improvement noted for transition-metal complex proper
ties.125,191−193
An alternative approach is to leverage error cancellation by
quantifying relative or referenced194,195 energetics. Batista and
co-workers194 demonstrated reduction of redox potential errors to within the margin of error on experimental redox potential values (ca. 64 mV) by calculating redox potentials relative to the value of a couple in the same row of the periodic table and under the same solvent conditions (Figure 14). These results provided a slight improvement over earlier suggestions of using the well-characterized one-electron
ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple.195 Interestingly, it was more straightforward to reduce errors from modest basis

sets (i.e., 6-311G*) than larger ones.195 Similar observations have been made in referenced (i.e., isodesmic) pKa predictions
involving transition-metal complexes196 and in heterogeneous catalysis where modified reference adsorbate energies (e.g., O atom from H2O−H2) have been suggested to be less sensitive
to the computational method.197
2.4. Moving Beyond DFT in Transition-Metal Chemistry
As computing power increases and reduced-scaling algorithms
have been developed,154,198−202 correlated wave function theory (WFT) methods have become increasingly tractable. In return for the high formal scaling (i.e., >O(N5)), singlereference (SR) WFT methods such as coupled cluster theory are widely regarded as being able to achieve chemical accuracy (i.e., predictions to within 1 kcal/mol of experiment) in the realm of organic chemistry. However, the challenges for DFT posed by transition-metal chemistry are not easily overcome by carrying out SR WFT. Both the larger size of transition-metal complexes (100s−1000s of electrons and 10s−100s of atoms) and the nature of electron correlation in open d and f shells play a role in this distinction. The SR methods that work well for organic chemistry are less predictive in open-shell
transition-metal chemistry.203 This has been attributed to the greater contribution of static correlation in open-shell transition-metal complexes as well as a greater sensitivity to
the degree of recovery of dynamic correlation.204,205 When two spin states or a reactant and intermediate are compared, even a slight difference in the ability of a method to recover the dynamic correlation from a single Slater determinant can lead to an outsized effect on relative energetics.
Among the outstanding challenges for WFT in transition
metal chemistry are that the local approximations154,202 to single-reference CCSD(T) that make it tractable on larger transition-metal complexes have a strong influence on spin
state predictions205 as does the choice of orbitals or
determinants.206 These observations have led some to
question203 or alternatively defend207 the proposition that coupled cluster methods can outperform DFT functionals for transition-metal chemistry in terms of agreement with experiment. These comparisons are complicated by the potentially greater uncertainty associated with experimental reference data for transition-metal chemistry. While multireference (MR) WFT methods appear to be promising, most such methods remain intractable for highthroughput screening due to cost and typical requirements of manual tuning of parameters and active spaces. Alternatives to overcome limitations imposed by manual active space selection
include rule-based,208 automated,209,210 and machine learning
(ML) model-based211 approaches. Automated active space selection in transition-metal chemistry, e.g., with measures of
orbital entanglement,212−214 often reveals a large number of participating orbitals for systems with significant covalency

(e.g., CrF6 in Figure 15).209 Lower-scaling, multireference perturbation theory (i.e., complete active space second-order perturbation theory or CASPT2) can be applied to moderately sized transition-metal complexes. CASPT2 spin-state ordering is sensitive to both the zeroth-order Hamiltonian (IPEA)
shift,215 with predictions alternately biased186 toward low-spin or high-spin states depending on the choice of shift, and the
treatment of semicore states216 (Figure 16). Recent work has
motivated a composite CASPT2/CC217 approach for openshell transition-metal chemistry. Overall, MR WFT remains challenging to apply in highthroughput screening or data generation for machine learning, with SR WFT and DFT being easier to automate. While this could change in the near future with improvements in methods and computing power, it will remain useful to know which compounds in a screening pool have the strongest MR character. Numerous diagnostics with heuristic cutoffs have
been proposed.218−229 These diagnostics can be classified by whether they probe the propensity of frontier orbitals to
become partially occupied224,225,227−231 or whether they indicate a strong sensitivity of a property (e.g., the atomization energy) to the method employed as well as whether they are derived from a SR WFT or DFT calculation versus directly
from an MR WFT (e.g., CASSCF leading weights218−221) calculation. Many of the most predictive diagnostics require
carrying out computationally demanding correlated WFT calculations (e.g., with CCSD for the T1 diagnostic218) that would be too costly for high-throughput screening. DFT-based
diagnostics224,226−230 that are more tractable have been proposed, including those based on the atomization energy224,226 as well as measures of fractional occupa
tion227−230 in a finite-temperature DFT calculation. Appropriate diagnostic cutoffs for identifying when MR character is large enough to erode SR WFT predictions differ by material, typically with larger values motivated for transition-metal chemistry in comparison to those for organic molecules.232,233 Diagnostics often disagree, leading to reliance on intuition or a subset of the proposed cutoffs. The ability of machine learning tools to overcome some of these limitations is described in section 5.3.
2.5. Bringing Statistical Learning to Molecular Modeling
The molecular mechanics, semiempirical, and quantum mechanical methods described in sections 2.1−2.4 provide essential training data for machine learning model development, as described in detail in the next sections. Here, we briefly touch upon some key efforts that have been taken to systematically improve transition-metal chemical modeling techniques with statistical learning.

MM force fields for transition-metal chemistry are traditionally parametrized by hand against a small number of experimental crystal structures. Although more systematic
parametrization, e.g., with GAs37,61 or Newton−Raphson,15 has been demonstrated, the small sizes of the data sets limit testing or validation of the force fields. Still, opportunities for incorporating machine learning into this approach were
recognized early on.19 In 2002, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to transition-metal chemistry force field
development by Marques and Cukrowski,234 who used the ANN to interpolate estimated errors for the bond distance and force constant of Co(II) porphyrins, reducing the time required to test individual force field parameters (Figure 17). A single trained ANN was selected for this interpolation, and further improvements could be achieved by training on multiple subsets of the data in an approach known as crossvalidation. In cross-validation, the subset of data not used in the training of each model is in the validation set, and the lowest average error over the validation set is used to select parameters to avoid overfitting to noisy data. In organic chemistry, SQM modeling and machine learning models have been combined with some success. Integration of the DFTB Hamiltonian into deep learning models as an additional layer has been shown to impart greater physics to the ML model and improve model performance on small
organic molecules.235 Because correlations between SQM and
DFT structures or properties are poor,93 the transfer learning approaches that have been successful in organic chemis
try236,237 may fail in transition-metal chemistry. The use of machine learning to accelerate DFT-level property prediction for transition-metal chemistry at low cost is discussed in section 4. Here, we note some early efforts to systematically reduce errors in DFT functionals with statistical learning. The standard approach to exchange-correlation development typically involves small data sets of organic molecules or closed-shell atoms as well as constraints imposed
by satisfying exact bounds of model systems.121,122 For transition-metal chemistry, common guidance on functional selection tends to fail, motivating correction schemes with a range of first-principles and empirical roots (section 2.3.3). The “Minnesota” functionals developed by Truhlar and co
workers (e.g., the pure M06-L238 or hybrid M06239) are an exception to this and have gained wide popularity in modeling
inorganic complexes.240 To develop these, a much larger
training set that includes transition-metal chemistry is used.239 These functionals perform well when the chemistry being modeled is sufficiently similar to the training data, but researchers have encountered difficulty in systematically
reducing their errors.180 This can be interpreted in the context of statistical learning, where a high number of parameters and
paucity of training data lead to overfitting.241 Although not targeted at open-shell transition-metal chemistry, researchers have addressed this in part by exploring ways to incorporate
regularization and parameter selection242 into DFT functionals. In complementary efforts, researchers have leveraged statistical tools, such as uncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis, to inform DFT property prediction. UQ refers to a Bayesian framework where an ensemble of functionals are employed to produce a credible interval on
an average prediction.243−245 While UQ of DFT has primarily
been employed in the solid state,243,244,246 Reiher and coworkers have demonstrated its value in identifying functional
sensitive steps in a molecular reaction network.247 In closely related sensitivity analysis, derivatives of model predictions with respect to one or more functional parameters are
employed.138,148 For open-shell transition-metal chemistry, the single most relevant functional parameter is the fraction of HF exchange, which is often associated with key variations of the transition-metal complex (e.g., ligand field, see section
2.3.3). Both linear138,148 and nonlinear ML models54 (e.g., ANNs) of the relationship between chemical structure and exchange-correlation functional sensitivity have been developed. These models were used to identify how SCOs (i.e., with

ML models that reduce the cost or complexity of recovering the correlation energy in wave function theory have yet to be demonstrated in transition-metal chemistry, but some have been developed to aid identification of when correlated WFT is needed (See section 5.3.2). Statistically informed (e.g., with mutual information between orbitals214) methods of active space selection204,210,214 have also demonstrated promise. ML models for active space selection211 have yet to be demonstrated on large transition-metal complexes but could be improved to enable rapid assessment of the effect the active space on property prediction. The ways in which data science is informing and enriching chemical discovery efforts by reducing barriers to the application of expert-level computational chemistry decisions is discussed in greater detail in section 5.3.2.
3. PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF TRANSITION-METAL COMPLEXES
The tunable nature of metal centers in open-shell transitionmetal complexes gives rise to a range of applications. Transition-metal complexes are most well established in the field of homogeneous catalysis, including their use as
precatalysts.248,249 Molecular transition-metal complexes have
also long been studied for their potential as sensors,250,251
molecular machines,252 molecular magnets,253,254 redox
couples for energy storage,255,256 and dye sensitizers.257,258 As a result of their nature and applications, the target properties for prediction by machine learning or traditional computational (e.g., quantum mechanical or molecular mechanical) techniques differ from those in other domains, such as heterogeneous catalysis, solid-state materials, or in discovery of organic molecules as therapeutic drugs. We thus briefly review these key focus areas for property evaluation with experiment and their relationships to computational predictions. Discussion of these properties provides useful background on the development of statistical and deep learning methods for their prediction (section 4) and in materials discovery (section 5).
3.1. Catalytic Properties
The most widespread application of transition-metal catalyst design is likely in the selective functionalization of fine
chemicals (e.g., therapeutic drugs).259 While heterogeneous
catalysts are favored in many large-scale operations,259 molecular catalysts remain superior for select industrial applications such as hydroformylation (e.g., with Co or
Rh),248,260 olefin metathesis (e.g., with Ru),261 or selective
C−H activation (e.g., with Pd).262 Transition-metal complexes
also have been used widely in photocatalysis263 and in
molecular electrocatalysis264 (e.g., for water oxidation265). Identification of optimal catalyst ligand structures requires determination of the mechanism and turnover frequency (i.e., how quickly the catalytic cycle completes). Catalysts also must be optimized for their selectivity for the preferred reaction without generating undesired intermediates. For a designed catalyst to be useful in practice, the catalyst structure must also be determined to be stable (e.g., not prone to auto-oxidation, dimerization, or ligand dissociation) and not easily deacti
vated.266 Observations of catalyst activity will be sensitive to the reaction conditions, including temperature, solvent, and pH. Frequently, experimental efforts tune the Hammett
parameters of ligands267 (i.e., through electron-donating and electron-withdrawing group addition) or otherwise vary ligand properties in order to deduce structure−property relationships. Such kinetic studies can reveal linear free energy relationships
(LFERs) that identify limits of how reaction steps may be
tuned.268,269
Challenges for interfacing data-driven or computational models with experiment occur when the key reactive catalyst structure is poorly characterized, e.g., if the added species is
effectively a precatalyst270 that aggregates into catalytically
active nanoparticles.271 Furthermore, flexible ligand structure and noncovalent interactions have been increasingly adopted
as useful tools in catalyst design,272 but their contributions in operando can be challenging to determine. Experimentally, many characterization techniques can only be applied to the spent catalyst or reaction products, with short-lived intermediates sometimes trapped through freeze-quenching X-ray
absorption spectroscopy,273 a technique more widely em

ployed in enzymology.274,275 Other useful spectroscopic techniques for catalyst characterization include ultrafast
vibrational (e.g., infrared) spectroscopy,276 electrochemical
characterization with cyclic voltammetry,277 isotopic label
ing,278 and mass spectrometry.279,280 Reactions involving hydrogen (e.g., hydrogen atom transfer) can be sensitive to quantum mechanical tunneling effects. Experimentally, kinetic isotope effects can be used to probe the relevance of such
contributions in catalysis.278,281 Given the fleeting nature of intermediates, computational tools are an essential complement to experimental catalyst studies. Computationally, relative energetics of intermediates can be identified and activation energies used to obtain rate constants, with trends in rate constants being less sensitive to method errors (see section 2). Combining rate constants with
microkinetic282 modeling or the simplifying degree of rate
control283 or energy span models284 can help to refine the identification of rate-determining steps, rate laws, and to relate computational predictions to experimentally observable turn
over frequencies and numbers (Figure 19).285 For many open
shell transition-metal complexes, the identity of the spin state is believed to be important, whether by confining the reaction to a single spin state or by multiple spin states being invoked to
explain reactivity patterns.286,287 In these cases, calculation of minimum energy crossing points between spin surfaces as well
as coupling between spin surfaces becomes important.288 All of these efforts are sensitive to errors (section 2) in the electronic structure methods typically employed (i.e., DFT). The experimental resolution of spin-state-dependent reactivity (i.e., with distinct kinetics for each spin state) is challenging but has been corroborated through spectroscopic and kinetic
isotope effect data (e.g., for C−H activation).289,290 Computational modeling of reaction mechanisms can aid these experimental studies. However, exhaustive search of intermediates and evaluation of transition states are time
consuming. This motivates the reliance on the Brønsted− Evans−Polanyi principle to use reaction thermodynamics as a proxy for activation energies, a particularly widely exploited
approach in computational heterogeneous catalysis.291 The benefit of such analysis has also been realized in experiments through the observation that simple-to-obtain properties can
predict catalytic activity.292 The experimental characterization of some properties of the metal center (e.g., transition-metal
hydricity293) has been used to predict the effect of solvent on the reactivity of transition-metal catalysts (e.g., for CO2
reduction294). The direct or indirect roles of the solvent and counterions in homogeneous catalysis are increasingly areas of research
focus.295,296 Computationally, the role of solvent, solubility, and entropic corrections (i.e., both harmonic and anharmonic contributions) are often neglected or treated only approx
imately (e.g., with implicit models)297 with studies that
consider these effects in combination being rare exceptions.298 Correction schemes for computational electrochemistry that may work well for redox potential refinement (section 2) are expected to be challenged by significant rearrangement across
an electrocatalytic cycle.299,300
3.2. Redox Properties
Redox activity and electron transfer processes are useful for catalysis and energy storage. Cyclic voltammetry is used to determine redox potentials, including for electrocatalyst and
functional materials characterization.277 Well-established redox processes, e.g., the one-electron oxidation of ferrocene, can be
useful as an internal reference both computationally194,195 and
experimentally,301,302 especially when varying the solvent in which the redox potential is measured. Nevertheless, only a few moderately sized (ca. 100+ points) data sets of experimental redox potentials for mononuclear transition-metal com
plexes178,303 are available across a range of solvents. Experimentally, challenges exist in identifying if the structure changes (e.g., by complexation of distinct solvent molecules or
counterions304) when a material is oxidized or reduced. When multiple metal centers are present in close enough proximity to form metal−metal bonds, unexpected changes in the number of redox events and in redox potential values have been
observed (Figure 20).305 Some of these changes can be traced to the degree of metal−metal bonding (i.e., distance estimated from the formal shortness ratio) and the resulting spin state
(Figure 20).305 An added challenge for both computation and experiment is the difficulty in knowing a priori when ligand noninnocence will lead to ligand oxidation or reduction rather
than the electron transfer event occurring at the metal.306−308 A well-established example of this effect is the valence tautomerism between catecholate and semiquinonate forms of chelating ligands, where a reversible equilibrium between the two ligand states can be observed at room temperature,
depending on the metal ion identity, charge, and spin state.309 For redox couples, even simple cases with a single metal and no anticipated ligand noninnocence, accurate calculation of a redox potential can be a challenge because errors can be sensitive to the relative accuracy of the evaluation of properties of the reduced and oxidized species. Computationally,
referenced Born−Haber cycles have been proposed194,195 as a way to reduce errors (see section 2 and Figure 14), but additional corrections are often necessary for highly charged
transition-metal complexes.310,311 Explicit treatment of solvent, especially in aqueous solution, has been shown to be critical for

reproducing experimental trends,312−314 whereas implicit treatment of the solvation environment on redox processes is more computationally tractable for screening and for training data-driven models.
3.3. Optical Properties
Optical spectroscopic interrogation of transition-metal com
plexes is useful both for their characterization315,316 (e.g., electronic and oxidation-state identification) and for understanding how their optical properties can be exploited for various applications. For example, harnessing light to enable chemical transformations is widely exploited in photo
catalysis.263 Transition-metal complexes have long been used
as dyes,317 dye sensitizers in optoelectronic devices,257 and have recently seen even broader application in molecular
electronics.318 The spectrochemical series of strong-field (e.g.,
CN− or CO) to weak-field (e.g., H2O or oxalate) ligands is named for the observed relationship between optical absorption of homoleptic octahedral complexes and the effect
of the ligands on the metal d states.319 In some cases, tuning optical absorption of a complex across the visible range (i.e., as observed qualitatively or with UV/vis absorption spectra) is also possible via solvent adjustment or by tuning the field
strength of the axial ligands alone320 (e.g., tuning L in Rh2(OAc)4(L)2, Figure 21). Depending on the ligand, the absorption range of transition-metal complexes can be tuned
(e.g., into the visible321 or into the near-infrared317). While a key advantage of optical characterization is that the absorption spectrum often provides useful insight into the electronic structure and magnetic properties (e.g., spin state), the relationship between trends in these quantities is not always
consistent.322 In addition to the energy gaps between ground and excited states, other properties of excited states can be designed such
as lifetimes, e.g., for applications in small-molecule sensing.321 The interplay of optical and redox or spin-state properties gives rise to transition-metal complexes with switchable absorption
features.323 Modulation of absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) has been demonstrated with potential applications in
telecommunications.323 Transition-metal complexes frequently act as emissive compounds, most typically from triplet excited
states324 (e.g., in Ru or Ir polypyridyl compounds). Recently,
some of these complexes have been reported to have intense
fluorescence with long lifetimes.324 When the intersystem crossing between excited states is faster in one direction than the other, the resulting phenomenon is called thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which has potential
applications in lighting and molecular electronics.318,325,326 Because the metal center and ligand chemistry of the transition-metal complex can be tailored to adjust these excited-state properties, they have significant potential for design. Luminescent properties of transition-metal complexes
can be readily tuned by adjusting solvent327 or ligand chemistry. In the context of lighting applications, they can be tailored for emission ranges (e.g., blue) that are currently limited in commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs), leading to
advances beyond existing LED technologies.318 Broadly, numerous transition-metal complexes have been
observed328 to have unique nonlinear optical (NLO) proper
ties,329 making them amenable for switching in response to

chemical, photochemical, or electrochemical stimuli. Different architectures have been developed, wherein metal centers act
as donors, acceptors, or bridging moieties.329 This tunability and modularity has led to a range of designs of NLO materials
based on transition-metal complexes.329−331
3.4. Magnetism and Other Switchable Functional Materials Properties
A change in electronic state of a transition-metal complex in response to stimuli that in turn changes its properties presents opportunities for materials design. As a paradigmatic example, open-shell metal centers (e.g., octahedral, N-coordinated
Fe(II) complexes) frequently exhibit SCO behavior.251,332,333 The transition between a low-spin (LS) singlet and high-spin (HS) quintet state is associated with changes in optical and structural properties that can then be leveraged, e.g., in host−
guest334 sensing. This phenomenon also governs SCO
behavior in MOFs,334 including the material Co[Cr(CN)6]2/3·zH2O, which changes both size and color as it is reversibly dehydrated (Figure 22). The change in the spin state
typically is associated with a change in the metal−ligand bond
length and thus entropic contributions to stability.334 In these cases, the high-spin state is often higher in energy but becomes
stabilized with increasing temperature,332 in the presence of
guest (e.g., solvent335) molecules,336 change in solvent337 or
lattice packing,338 or can be trapped via light-induced
excitation to the high-spin state (i.e., LIESST).339 This
behavior has also been observed for other metals333 (e.g.,
Co(II)340) and in nonoctahedral341,342 environments. SCO complexes can be characterized a number of ways. The magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature typically reveals the nature of the crystalline or solution environment, either having a gradual or abrupt switch along with differing hysteresis widths. SCO is also typically associated with changes in the UV/vis spectrum (see section 3.1 and Figure 22). For
iron-containing complexes, Mössbauer spectroscopy provides key insight into electron density at the metal center, electron
configuration, and magnetic state.343 In fact, Mössbauer spectroscopy was developed in part through observations on
SCO complexes.343 Numerous metals (e.g., Mn, Co) are also amenable to characterization with electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.344 The magnetic properties of transition-metal complexes have also been tailored for device miniaturization in data storage/ memory and quantum computing. For quantum computing,
molecular qubits345−347 containing a range of V and Cu centers have demonstrated promise and have been characterized with both magnetic susceptibility and EPR. For
memory storage, single-molecule magnets254,348−350 containing
either multiple Mn centers or mononuclear metal centers,253 often with heavier lanthanide elements, have also been designed and characterized for their magnetic susceptibility. From a machine learning or computational chemistry perspective, properties of SCOs, single-molecule magnets, and qubits are all influenced by spin-state ordering, entropic contributions and spin−orbit coupling between states, with each having some challenges in its description with firstprinciples methods (see section 2).
4. STATISTICAL MODELING FOR TRANSITION-METAL CHEMISTRY
Statistical modeling techniques have long been applied in transition-metal chemistry. However, the availability and diversity of data in transition-metal chemistry imparts unique challenges and opportunities. We describe the available data sets and analysis derived from data mining of experimental and computational results in section 4.1. Next, we briefly describe descriptor development and application in quantitative structure−property relationships (QSPRs) on both experimental and molecular modeling data in section 4.2. We conclude this section with early and more recent demonstrations using machine learning algorithms such as kernel ridge regression as well as deep learning (i.e., with artificial neural networks) in section 4.3.
4.1. Data Mining Structures for Chemical Trends
Data sets of transition-metal complexes tend to be smaller, more varied, and more subject to uncertainty (i.e., noise) in both experimental (see section 3) and computational (see section 2) properties than organic molecule data sets. The largest repository of metal−organic complexes is the Cam
bridge Structural Database (CSD),160 which consists of approximately 140 000 unique mononuclear transition-metal complexes in a larger number of solved X-ray crystal structures. The value of mining geometric properties to understand trends and structure−property relationships was recognized decades ago, despite the fact that the set of structures in the CSD was
considerably smaller at that time.351,352 User-friendly graphical
tools,353 improved annotation of metal oxidation state and
complex charge,354 as well as a python API have made it increasingly straightforward to mine experimental structures. We briefly review opportunities for using CSD data in data
driven and machine learning models. Reviews by Fey3 and
Orpen355 provide greater detail of how CSD data mining has been used in transition-metal chemistry. Subsets of the CSD have been mined to identify trends in transition-metal complex structures, including the propensity
of a metal for specific coordination numbers.356 In the 1990s,

Orpen and co-workers started curating subsets from the CSD to interpret “structural systematics” that related ligand
structure and bonding, especially in phosphine ligands.357−361 Avnir, Alvarez, and co-workers analyzed large sets (i.e., over 23 000) of transition-metal complex structures from the CSD and used this data to develop continuous shape measures that describe the relationships between different idealized coordi
nation symmetries and numbers.362−365 These symmetry measures have been employed to rationalize and interpret changes in SCO complex structure observed with ultrafast
spectroscopy.366 Although developed for molecular crystals, similar local measures of topology based on Voronoi polyhedral volumes and deviations from idealized values have
also recently shown promise, e.g., for porous MOFs.367 Analysis of metal−ligand bond lengths in the CSD has been used to estimate the effective size of atoms, including spin
state-dependent covalent radii of transition metals368 and the
degree of covalency in metal−ligand bonds.369 The CSD has also been widely used to develop an understanding of structure−property relationships among known classes of materials (e.g., structural asymmetry in Dy-containing single
molecule magnets370). The CSD has been mined to uncover other structural trends. This has led to confirmation of expected relationships between bond length and strength (e.g., for late Cu, Zn compounds
with common O/N-coordinating ligands),371 identification of
metal coordination number preference,372 quantification of
metal-dependent trans effects (see section 2),373 and validation of the expectation of longer bond lengths for higher
coordination numbers.372 The large number of structural variations in synthesized ligands also motivated data mining to elucidate the relationship between metal−ligand bonding and
steric effects358 or conformer preference in well-studied
macrocycles.374 Although catalytic intermediates are often fleeting and cannot be captured crystallographically, structure−reactivity relationships have been inferred from CSD data, e.g., by studying the relationship between complex structure and small
molecule binding.375 For example, a difference in preference of dinitrogen binding to mononuclear (i.e., end-on) versus binuclear transition-metal complexes (i.e., side-on) was
observed375 as were shifts in the degree of metal-dependent (i.e., 3d vs 4d and early vs late) back-bonding in metal−
carbonyl bonds376 (Figure 23). Structures from the CSD have been shown to have good correspondence with typically challenging to crystallize/characterize metalloenzyme active
sites.377 This data set has been leveraged in a number of other ways, including to curate fragments for improved structure
generation of de novo complexes50,51 (see section 5). Despite the value the CSD data set provides, limitations on the utility of the data are notable. Most structures are obtained from X-ray diffraction, which by definition includes the influence of the crystal field environment. Researchers have analyzed packing effects and found them to significantly influence structures of relatively flexible metal−organic
complexes.361 In less pathological cases, these effects were
observed to be small (ca. 0.01−0.02 Å).355,361 In 2006, Fey, Orpen, and co-workers proposed semiautomated workflows to detect structural outliers and use DFT calculations to determine if the disagreement between DFT and the crystal structure was evidence of unusual chemistry versus a potentially erroneously solved crystal structure (Figure
24).378 Other complications include the fact that structures
in the CSD may have unknown or erroneous oxidation-state assignment, which has motivated recent development of efficient heuristic models that can automatically assign
oxidation state with good (ca. 85%) accuracy.354 The intense experimental focus on metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) has been leveraged in the development of the
computation-ready, experimental MOF (CoRE MOF)379,380
database first introduced in 2014.379 CoRE MOF consists of most 3D MOF structures deposited in the CSD. In 2019, the
database was refined380 to expand the original set of 5109 3D MOFs to a larger set of 14 142 MOFs along with an improved procedure for identifying and removing free solvent molecules, recovering disordered structures, and mapping between literature references and CSD structural files. This type of database has been exploited to accelerate high-throughput
screening of MOFs for C−H activation381 and to build machine learning models to predict properties related to gas
separations and storage, such as surface area382 and adsorption
isotherms.383 These sets have also been instrumental in revealing mismatches between hypothetical and synthesized
materials.384 Given that the CoRE MOF resource provides a mapping between the structures and the literature associated with them, natural language processing (NLP) has begun to be
exploited to map structure to properties in MOFs.385,386 NLP has been more widely demonstrated for other tasks, including
understanding materials synthesis recipes385 (see also section 5.3.4).

New tools are also being developed as part of the CSD to
allow for expansion and analysis of experimental structures.387 In a similar fashion to the MOF or solid-state data sets, closedshell molecular transition-metal complexes have recently been the subject of high-throughput computational screening with a combination of semiempirical methods (see section 2) and
DFT.388 The generation of DFT properties on experimental structures is considerably better established for solid-state materials, where a number of repositories are available (e.g.,
AFLOWlib,389 Materials genome project,390 and Open
Quantum Materials Database391) that share semilocal-DFTcomputed properties for materials design. An outstanding limitation is that many of these sets of extracted structures are primarily used as a starting point for simulation, rather than mapping to experimental results (e.g., by extraction of spectroscopic or catalytic quantities), which may not be systematically reported. For example, to curate experimental data for their empirical DBLOC corrections (see section 2), Friesner and co-workers manually analyzed graphs for key peak
features.175 CSD structural data has also been subject to multiple linear regression (MLR) (see section 4.2) and supervised ML models (see section 4.4) and analyzed with unsupervised machine learning (see section 4.3). In particular, Fey, Orpen, and coworkers have leveraged the CSD data to build “ligand
knowledge base” (LKB)392,393 subsets and analyze them with principal component analysis (PCA) and MLR.
4.2. Building Structure−Property Relationships: Quantitative and Mechanistic Inquiry
Recent years have seen the development of machine learning models (section 4.4) that encode structure−property relationships and enable large-scale chemical exploration (section 5).
We briefly summarize here complementary approaches that bear similarity to machine learning efforts but typically rely more on intuition and human intervention. First, we briefly review quantitative structure−property relationships (QSPRs) for transition-metal chemistry, including frequently invoked descriptors (section 4.2.1) and examples of multiple linear regression QSPR models (section 4.2.2). Throughout, we use the term QSPR to refer broadly to simple, multivariate or heuristic mapping of structure to either property or activity of molecules (i.e., both QSPR and QSAR). Finally, we discuss how these approaches can be used quantitatively or qualitatively to guide iterative and mechanistic inquiry (section 4.2.3). Some of these approaches remain in widespread use in conjunction with machine learning models, as will be discussed in subsequent sections, and the performance of these transparent models can be used to determine when moving to more sophisticated machine learning models is beneficial. 4.2.1. Common Descriptor Types for QSPRs. Numerous descriptors have been developed as inputs to linear QSPR models or as guides for iterative design of catalysts. Recent reviews in refs 2, 3, and 394−396 provide more detail on the range of descriptors that have been used in the mechanistic study of transition-metal complexes. We briefly highlight here some representative QSPR descriptors to enable comparison to representations more typically applied in deep learning in section 4.4. The descriptors typically used in QSPR models are either derived from quantities that are easy to measure experimentally (e.g., from vibrational spectroscopy or UV/vis) or to compute. To be predictive across modest (ca. 40−50) transition-metal complex sets, the descriptors are chosen to represent key chemical variations that determine an activity or property. For ligand design in homogeneous catalysis, where the approach of substrate to the catalyst is strongly directed by ligand shape, a focus has been placed on the sterics of either the individual ligands or of the complex. An early and prominent example of steric descriptors is the cone angle for
phosphine ligands devised by Tolman397,398 (Figure 25). By approximating the steric bulk of the substituted phosphine ligands, the Tolman cone angle was shown to approximately

quantify experimental measures of the ease of displacing
ligands in catalytic Ni(0) complexes397,398 (Figure 26). For N
heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes, the fraction of volume of the first coordination sphere that is “buried” by overlap with atoms from the NHC ligand has been proposed as an alternative quantitative descriptor of steric bulk (Figure
25).396−400 Because this volume represents the space around the metal atom that must be shared by the different ligands upon coordination, it has been shown to be a good linear predictor of the experimentally measured relative cost to displace ligands from Ru-containing transition-metal com
plexes (Figure 27).399 These descriptors have been made accessible to users through the development of an easy-to-use
web interface.400 First developed in the 1970s, sterimol parameters of ligand length and asymmetry have recently
been demonstrated401 to be useful descriptors for QSPRs in
the design of enantioselective catalysts.396 Steric descriptors have also been obtained from the molecular mechanics ligand repulsion energy (i.e., van der Waals terms only) associated
with the cost to displace a ligand from a metal center.402 Geometric properties were widely used as descriptors in early QSAR/QSPR studies because they can be readily
extracted from crystal structures403 (see section 4.1) or reasonably estimated from moderately accurate molecular
mechanics force fields404 (see section 2). Experimental or calculated chelating atom distances were used to classify spin
crossover complexes.405 Similarly, molecular mechanics and DFT were both shown to be predictive of experimental bidentate bite angles that can inform reactivity, thus demonstrating how tuning ligand chemistry can be used to
rationally design ligands.404,406 Analysis of known Ziegler− Natta catalyst structures revealed the importance of metal−
ligand dihedrals as descriptors.403 Other measures of the planarity of the ligand around the metal (e.g., twisting and puckering) have been proposed from semiempirical or force field modeling to be useful in predicting enantioselectivity of
catalysts (e.g., Jacobsen−Katsuki epoxidation catalysts).407,408 In addition to numerical descriptors, 3D QSPR descriptors originally developed for organic chemistry were adapted to ligand design in transition-metal complexes. One of the most widely used approaches in 3D QSPR is comparative molecular
field analysis (CoMFA).409 In CoMFA, a molecular electrostatic potential or steric repulsion is evaluated using a probe molecule on a grid around the structure. Although initially designed with protein−ligand binding in mind, CoMFA descriptors found use in ligand design for transition-metal
chemistry.410−413 In close analogy to CoMFA, specialized projections of steric bulk and crowding proximal to the metal center in steric maps have been proposed to provide richer insight into potentially anisotropic contributions relevant for enantioselective catalysis
(Figure 25).400 Lipkowitz and co-workers pioneered414,415 an approach tailored for enantioselective catalyst design that they referred to as stereocartography. In this approach, the probe is a transition state displaced along a grid to identify regions of maximum stereoinduction (Figure 28). Using this stereocartography technique in conjunction with semiempirical energy evaluations, most (ca. 95% or 17 of 18) catalysts were found to conform to the hypothesis that enantioselectivity is made possible only when the point of greatest discrimination between enantiomers is close to the reacting
center.414,415
Through-bond electronic effects are also known to have a significant influence on the properties of transition-metal complexes and have therefore been invoked in QSPR models. For example, Hammett parameters have long been used to
quantify and predict effects of tuning on catalysis.416,417 Both parametrized semiempirical methods and DFT functionals became increasingly accessible over the past 20 years (see section 2), leading to the increased use of QM-computed
electronic descriptors in QSPR/QSAR modeling.3,394 Electronic parameters easily extracted from DFT were observed to correlate to experimentally measured structural determinants of reactivity that could only be obtained after a catalyst was
crystallized and characterized.418 Widely employed descriptors include metal partial charges and quantities derived from
frontier orbital energies.419 Reactivity descriptors such as
estimates of electrophilicity419 or softness420 of the metal have

been proposed. Similarly, explicitly computed ionization potentials, electron affinities, or the analogous orbital energies (e.g., HOMO or LUMO) have been widely used as descriptors
owing to the expectation of their influence on reactivity.420,421 Other DFT-derived descriptors include simpler-to-compute quantities (e.g., LUMO, pKa) representative of the overall catalytic activity but obtained only on the organic ligands in
the complex.422 The application of these descriptors in iterative catalyst design with linear models is discussed next in section 4.2.2, and the relationship of these descriptors to those developed more recently for machine learning applications will be discussed in section 4.4.
4.2.2. Examples of QSPR Models for Transition-metal Chemistry. QSPR modeling in transition-metal chemistry has provided important insight into the design of transition-metal complexes. Here, we distinguish QSPRs from other supervised learning (section 4.4) models by referring specifically to models developed on small data sets (ca. 50−100 points) that are typically used to predict an experimental measure of catalyst activity, redox potential, or other property using
(multiple) linear regression (MLR).3,394,410 While QSPR models are typically fit to all available data given the small data set sizes, there are exceptions where cross-validation
error423 or other error estimations from bootstrapping were
demonstrated.406 Prediction and tuning of redox potentials is an example application to which QSPR modeling has long been applied because the absolute experimental redox potential is challenging to predict even from accurate theoretical chemistry methods (see section 2). At the same time, prediction of relative redox properties to identify opportunities for tuning is an easier task, and corrections to DFT can be easily fit with
simple linear models.194,424 For example, the difference in strain energy between reduced and oxidized states of redox
couples (e.g., Co(III/II)425,426) from a tailored (i.e., MM2 with tuned terms for the metal−ligand bond) force field has been demonstrated to estimate experimental redox potentials with reasonable fidelity (i.e., R2 = 0.78). This agreement is impressive considering the neglect of solvent, entropic, and other electronic effects not included in the method.
Descriptors from DFT, such as orbital energies of electrons involved in oxidation, have also been used to identify how to
tune redox potentials (e.g., in W-containing complexes427). For predicting spin-state-dependent behavior, Phan et al. showed that the experimental nitrogen−nitrogen separation of a free ligand in 33 homoleptic Fe(II) diimmine complexes could be used to classify when a complex would exhibit spin
crossover behavior (Figure 29).405 Geometric descriptors were
also found to be important in iterative ligand design for spin
state properties of Fe(II) polypyridines.428 Data mining and linear correlation analysis have also been carried out on substituted Mn cubanes to identify the most important
structural properties that influence magnetic behavior.429 QSPRs have been most widely employed for experimental catalyst screening. Much of this work is outlined in recent reviews such as refs 394, 413, and 430. Often, the target predicted quantity (i.e., experimental enantioselectivity) in these cases is sufficiently challenging to obtain from computation such that even relatively expensive descriptors derived from DFT calculations represent an efficiency improvement over direct screening. In nearly all such cases, a single metal and oxidation state is employed, meaning that organic-focused descriptors developed for organic chemistry QSPRs are often suitable. Sigman and co-workers have demonstrated both quantum mechanical and steric descriptors across data sets of numerous catalysts to predict experimental
activity,431−433 as reviewed in detail in refs 401 and 430. In most cases, descriptors are evaluated on a single ligand or substrate conformer, but for highly flexible ligands and substrates, weighted evaluation of 3D descriptors has been
demonstrated.434 In many of these examples, the QSPR models themselves serve to guide improvements to ligand chemistry. At the same time, models capable of predicting DFT-derived catalytic properties have also been pursued in cases where experimental data was limited or as a means to understand trends in DFT-derived reactivity. For example, Truhlar and co
workers investigated419 how linear models could predict selectivity of Ru catalysts with NHC ligands toward olefin metathesis over cyclopropanation. To simplify screening, they correlated DFT estimates of catalyst selectivity (i.e., relative reaction free energy barriers of the competing reactions) to

electronic structure descriptors (Figure 30).419 They showed that both metal partial charge and electrophilicity could explain
DFT selectivities, highlighting a useful trend for experimental
ligand design.419 While correlations to experimental data may be preferred, identification of predictive quantities from the DFT calculation provides important insights into design principles where experimental data is limited or not robust due to contributions from competing processes, such as side reactions. Parveen et al. investigated whether through-space geometric descriptors or through-bond electronic effects could better explain differences in 38 sandwich Zr complexes for polymer
ization.435 The developed MLR models were predictive of reactivity trends (R2 = 0.86) and performed nearly as well as
more sophisticated (e.g., ANN) machine learning models.435 Jensen and co-workers employed a combination of cheminformatics-derived topological (see section 4.4) and DFTcalculated descriptors to predict DFT-calculated estimates of activity for 82 ligands in Grubbs Ru olefin metathesis catalysts, where the DFT-calculated activity was also known to correlate
to relative experimental activity.436 The final MLR model consisted of 14 features and had a modest cross-validation error after manual pruning of descriptors on a representative
test set below 1 kcal/mol.436 Analysis of the most important features revealed the dominant role of geometric and electronic properties of the RuCH2 bond for iterative ligand design
(see section 4.2.3).436 Linear models have also been built on DFT data to identify substrate-dependent factors that favor different (e.g., homolytic
vs heterolytic bond cleavage) catalytic mechanisms.437 Nazemi
and Cundari used this analysis to identify that substrate pKa
could play a more significant role than homolytic bond dissociation free energies in C−H activation by metal-oxo
catalysts.437 Correlations of ligand pKa have also been demonstrated across far-ranging applications from ligand
precursors in quantum dot synthesis438 to CO2 conversion422 kinetics. Relationships between pKa and a target activity/ property are closely related to those observed by Hammett on
organic compounds416,417 and the concepts of linear free energy relationships described in section 4.2.3. Fey et al. used QSPR descriptors and MLR models as
analysis tools for understanding ligand chemistry for design.406 They observed that stability of Cr complexes with chelating bidentate P,P or P,N ligands, as judged by DFT ligand removal energies, could be well predicted (R2 = 0.95 and mean squared
error of 3.2 kcal/mol, Figure 31).406 This model used a
combination of only five descriptors that included the proton affinity of the coordinating phosphorus in the ligand, two from the binding energy of the ligand to other metals (Zn or Pd), and two structural properties of the Zn complex analogue (i.e., the Zn−Cl bond in a Zn(L)Cl2 complex and the change in
ligand angle upon complexation).406 Addition of other descriptors, including the HOMO energy or other geometric properties, did not substantially improve model performance. This analysis highlights strategies to tune ligand chemistry and the extent to which these design principles might be transferable across multiple metals.
As an alternative approach, Maseras and co-workers439 used singular value decomposition (SVD) to uncover the predominant descriptors to build QSPRs for ligand binding energy (Figure 32). They determined that the number of “hidden” descriptors needed to predict DFT-level bond dissociation energies (BDEs) from transition-metal complexes was quite small, with a model that used only six able to predict the DFT BDE to within 1.4 kcal/mol. While application of the model to new complexes requires additional calculations to generate the relevant matrix elements, model generalization error was

low439 (Figure 32). They then identified the correlation between the six predominant descriptors obtained from the SVD to individual descriptors from a set of over 660 standard
quantities (e.g., charges, volumes, ionization potential, etc.).439 4.2.3. Descriptors in Linear Models and Iterative Design. Many transition-metal complex design studies leverage individual descriptors normally employed in combination in QSPRs to instead develop, test, and validate hypotheses. Such studies may evaluate effects one at a time or employ descriptors to guide the update of the set of compounds to evaluate with DFT or experiments. For example, orbital energies found to correlate to C−H activation were used to accelerate the screening of ligands for candidate methane-to-methanol catalysts with metals (i.e., Rh) that have
been less frequently studied experimentally.440 Such relationships tend to hold well within a given spin state and metal, but catalysts with varied ligand chemistry (e.g., denticity) or spin states often require the development of multiple linear relationships when a single descriptor is used. As an example, Sautet and co-workers showed multiple correlation lines were needed to explain the relationship between the LUMO σ* orbital of open-shell FeO moieties and the C−H activation energy when comparing monodentate and multidentate
catalysts (Figure 33).441 Common phosphine ligand descriptors related to angle and bonding strength were used by Cooney et al. to computationally identify novel ligands that exhibited behavior distinct from
those that had been previously synthesized (Figure 34).442 While less frequently applied, this descriptor-guided screening approach has been employed to identify ways to improve catalyst stability (i.e., by strengthening the bond with the
mostly weakly bound ligand) without affecting activity.443 When sterics are believed to play an essential role, this screening and iterative design process has been accelerated by using molecular-mechanics-derived quantities such as the
ligand repulsion energy402 to predict relative stereoselectivity
of substrate binding.444 Exploiting linear free energy relationships (LFERs) between activation energies and reaction energies or selectivities as well as relating energies to a specific descriptor is a special example of descriptor-based design. This approach has been most widely applied and popularized in heterogeneous catalysis, where it has been shown that bulk metal alloy reaction energetics are closely related to descriptors (e.g., the d-band center), enabling estimation of overall optimal activity (i.e., a
maximum in a volcano plot) from a single descriptor.445 The
natural bridges between heterogeneous and homogeneous
catalysis have become more evident,446 as LFERs have been
widely demonstrated in single-site MOF catalysis381,447,448 and
single-atom catalysts (SACs),449,450 a family of materials with isolated metal sites coordinated by N-doped graphene substrates that resemble and behave like macrocyclic catalysts
(e.g., porphyrins).451 Within homogeneous catalysis, the potential role of LFERs for catalyst design has thus been investigated with increasing
interest in recent years.422,441,446,452−458 Corminboeuf and co
workers452−455 have demonstrated how LFER-based volcano plot development can be used to accelerate homogeneous catalyst screening. They have demonstrated their approach to scaling relations for a range of reactions including cross
coupling,454,455 hydroformylation,453 and CO2 hydrogena
tion,452 among others. Recognizing the potential variability

of mechanism and scaling relationship as ligand chemistry
changes, they proposed453 developing and applying scaling
relations within families of ligand types (e.g., phosphines) to then construct multiple volcano plots and identify the optimal ligand chemistry for a specific reaction (Figure 35). In cases where a mechanism and scaling relationship are known, iterative experimental-computational efforts have been carried out in which calculations are used to predict functionalizations of ligands that will lead to improved
performance on established catalyst scaffolds.459−461 In another example, computed relative free energies were correlated to experimental selectivities (i.e., for 1-octene over
1-hexene formation) for ethylene oligomerization.462 This correlation was exploited to successfully computationally screen new ligand chemistry with the desired selectivity and
validated experimentally (Figure 36).462 This type of relative free energy barrier screening has also been beneficial in identifying, for a fixed Ni phosphine catalyst chemistry, which leaving groups on substrates were compatible with the desired
functionalization (Figure 37).463 Numerous researchers have
exploited computed464,465 transition-metal hydricities293,294 as a descriptor for activity in Fe(II) and Co(III) CO2 hydrogenation catalyst screening, owing to the scaling relationships to other governing steps in the catalytic cycle, including CO
binding. The energetic span model284 represents a generalization of this approach and has been fruitfully employed to iteratively vary pincer ligand design to maximize activity for carboxylation with CO2 by identifying ligand features that
increase turnover frequency466 or to analyze the effects of
functional groups on Rh sandwich catalysts.467 Nevertheless, the LFER-based, iterative screening approach has been most successfully demonstrated in closed-shell complexes with late transition metals. Larger-scale exploration of multiple oxidation states and spin states typically reveals the limitations of LFERs in catalyst screening. For example, the HOMO level of the resting state of a catalyst has been invoked as a good descriptor for how favorably a high-valent metal-oxo
species capable of C−H activation will form,448 but numerous

screening efforts have revealed exceptions.441,456,468 Gani et al.
observed456 that geometric distortions about Fe(II) metal centers in minimal model catalysts broke the strong scaling between hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and oxo formation central to the design of direct methane-to-methanol conversion catalysts (Figure 38). Tuning the ligand field, however, resulted in shifts along a standard scaling relationship, and analysis of experimentally characterized catalysts revealed that many macrocyclic catalysts indeed had the favored metal− ligand plane distortion. Distortion was also observed to be naturally occurring and beneficial in a class of Fe(II) single
molecule magnets due to Jahn−Teller distortions.469 Nandy et
al. showed457 that over a set of nearly 1200 catalysts, scaling relationships between metal-oxo formation and HAT differed widely with metal, oxidation, and spin state (Figure 39). The
observed scaling relations also differed from those that had
been proposed in heterogeneous381,447 (i.e., including
MOFs381) catalysis. These wide variations indicated that use of a single scaling relationship across the entire data set would fail to be predictive for catalyst screening, motivating more flexible machine learning models (see section 4.4). When the guiding descriptor for ligand design is unknown and the computational cost of determining reaction energetics is relatively high, a combination of descriptor-based screening and variation of ligand or metal chemistry in a small-scale screen is often beneficial. These screens are often used to determine the relative magnitude of effects, first by varying metal and then substrate or ligand chemistry. Pickup et al. built a computational database to observe what effects governed the experimental stability of 60 alkyne/vinylidene isomers bound
to a transition-metal complex (Figure 40).470 By comparing metals, substituents on the alkyne, and ligands in the rest of the
complex, they determined470 that the metal played a far more limited role in comparison to the alkyne chemistry in favoring a vinylidene structure. Shiekh et al. studied biomimetic Mo/W

CO2 hydrogenation catalysts to determine the relative magnitude of changing metal oxidation state, functional groups distant from the metal, and axial coordinating ligands (Figure
41).471 They observed a wide range of feasible H2 binding energies that could be used to tune the catalysts, with oxidation state playing a pivotal role in comparison to functional group
substitution.471 Similarly, factors governing ligand redox noninnocence are poorly understood, motivating a screen of how altering functional groups on o-benzoquinone ligands
affects the behavior of Co(II) complexes.472 Such studies are also widely used in inferring and confirming metal- or spin-state-dependent reactivity and mechanistic trends. Examples include comparisons of the role of metal identity, oxidation state, and row on the relative preference for proton-coupled electron transfer versus uncoupled reaction
steps473 and examinations of the influence on reactive intermediate (e.g., metal-fluoro vs metal-oxo) formation.474 These studies can also reveal when a descriptor that is pivotal in one class of reactions or catalysts bears less importance in others or when a single descriptor will prove insufficient. For water oxidation in bimetallic complexes, varying the metal identities revealed the numerous possible spin states and their cooperative effect on relative reaction barriers or favored mechanisms, giving rise to complex patterns that could not be captured by a single chemical descriptor.475 Similarly, while bite angle is often invoked in complexes with bidentate phosphine ligands, for reductive elimination at Pd(II) catalysts, the effect of electron-withdrawing groups on the ligands was found to be more significant.476 Iterative ligand design has also been demonstrated in cases where key aspects of an established catalyst are preserved, such as the presence of a multidentate ligand, while designing other less exhaustively explored ligands to propose improvements beyond known best-in-class catalysts.457,477 A key caveat in computational design is that ligand flexibility can alter reaction mechanism or influence predicted activation energies, often requiring a tight coupling between computation and experiment to realize such suggestions.478 While the design of transition-metal complexes for homogeneous catalysis has been the focus of much of the effort in computational chemistry, the rise of porous metal− organic frameworks or zeolites for gas separation has also spurred interest in mechanistic and iterative design with some parallels to catalyst design. Given the distinct scale and nature of MOF properties, the descriptors favored are often more focused on geometry or topology, as we will describe in more detail in section 4.4. For MOFs, iterative design has been carried out by holding fixed metal secondary building units (SBUs) expected to be needed for stability and key features (e.g., open sites for gas binding) while replacing and varying linker molecules to adjust for other properties such as surface area for gas storage.479,480 Alternately, researchers can study the effect of substituting metal sites in well-established frameworks to reveal metal-dependent gas adsorption without confounding factors from varied pore geometry.481 Analysis of the relationship between the resulting topology of the material and properties for gas adsorption has been used to reveal design principles and notably to identify a hypothetical

4.3. Unsupervised Learning
The concept of distance in chemical space plays an essential role in the interpretation, visualization, and manipulation of data sets and machine learning models (section 4.4). Principal component analysis (PCA) was among the first methods to leverage this concept and thus has been the most widely employed technique.3 PCA reduces a high-dimensional feature set to the set of normal vectors that encode as much of the variance in the data as possible. PCA has been widely applied to analyze trends in structural properties of common moieties
(e.g., MoO) in the CSD with changing ligand chemistry.482 Orpen, Fey, and co-workers have developed the most extensive PCA-based analysis of CSD structures, including through the application of PCA to electronic descriptors from DFT on
DFT-augmented “ligand knowledge bases” (LKB).3,483 They have exploited PCA on these LKBs to analyze relationships among ligand classes from the CSD (e.g., monoden
tate359,392,484 and bidentate485 phosphine or carbene486 ligands). For these curated sets, Fey and co-workers computed a range of steric and DFT-derived descriptors, and they then simplified the visualization of the ligand space by PCA dimensionality reduction (Figure 42).

clustering of families of ligand types, (ii) the two components typically represented the majority (>65%) of the data variance, and (iii) the descriptors were used to build predictive multiple linear regression (see section 4.2) models (Figure 42). Using PCA on other LKBs, they have also related PCs back to key
ligand variations, such as functional groups470 and steric or
electronic factors.3,406 As another early demonstration in the 1990s, Beyreuther et al. demonstrated both structural-descriptor-based multiple linear regression and unsupervised learning approaches, including PCA and self-organizing maps, which are a type of ANN used for unsupervised dimensionality reduction (here, 10
neurons in a Kohonen map).487 Using such techniques, they were able to predict tripodal complex conformations based on local descriptors such as bite angles using 82 CSD
complexes.487 Within heterogeneous catalysis, PCA has recently been applied to analyze which DFT binding energy
descriptors explain experimental observations488 or to guide
search for new catalysts with improved properties.489 Rothenberg and co-workers highlighted the importance of dimensionality reduction in interpreting the three highdimensional spaces most relevant to catalyst optimization: continuous feature space, discrete ligand space, and the ultimate property space being optimized (Figure 43). While PCA is primarily carried out on feature spaces, dimensionality reduction of the space of molecular properties/ activities for a set of compounds can also be useful. Such an approach has been used to identify activity cliffs (i.e., abrupt changes in properties with small changes in features) to reveal discontinuities in structure−activity relationships in therapeu
tic drugs.490 When points are distant in a feature space but similar in property, they also provide evidence that shallow, transparent models (e.g., MLR or KRR) would struggle to use these features to obtain a suitable prediction of properties. Thus, selection of optimal features by PCA has been carried
out491 as a feature selection technique, including in an iterative
fashion,492 for ML model training on data sets, as discussed further in section 4.4. PCA remains the most widely used approach and performs best when visualizing the first 2−4 PCs that capture the most data variance (i.e., ideally the majority). Alternative dimensionality reduction techniques have recently been proposed, including t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t
SNE)493 and uniform manifold approximation and projection
(UMAP),494,495 and these techniques have seen increased use in materials and catalyst discovery. Both aim to generate the most informative dimensions for visualizing data differences. The t-SNE algorithm approximately preserves pairwise
distances between each data point in a set,493 but it is stochastic in nature and thus cannot be used as a tool to visualize the effect of adding new data. UMAP aims to preserve local structure in a manner similar to t-SNE with slightly relaxed requirements on the pairwise separation that never
theless allows for data addition. Self-organizing maps487 and other clustering algorithms have been used in chemical discovery, for example k-means clustering is often used in large chemical spaces to select diverse leads for property optimization (see section 5.2). An additional use of dimensionality reduction techniques is in the visualization of the latent space of deep learning models or to identify when new data points (i.e., either in feature or property space) are distinct from prior training data (see section 4.4). 4.4. Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
In recent years, more highly parametrized supervised and semisupervised models have been employed in transition-metal chemistry property prediction and for molecular discovery. These include kernel methods (e.g., Gaussian processes and kernel ridge regression or KRR) as well as deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple hidden layers. In this section, we review some of the representations used for such models (section 4.4.1) and discuss applications of supervised regression (section 4.4.2) and classification (section 4.4.3) models to transition-metal chemistry. In comparison to smallmolecule organic chemistry, smaller data sets and more varied properties introduce distinct challenges for ML in transitionmetal chemistry.
4.4.1. Machine Learning Representations. The representations introduced as QSPR descriptors in section 4.2.3 (e.g., heuristic Hammett parameters of ligands) can also be
used491,496 in conjunction with deep learning models. Here, we briefly review additional recent representation developments that are more widely used in supervised deep learning models. For open-shell transition-metal chemistry, the limitations of force fields and semiempirical theories were discussed in section 2.2. As a result, force field or semiempirical preoptimization widely exploited in organic chemistry machine
learning to predict DFT-level energetics236 is typically avoided in transition-metal chemistry. As an example of geometry-free representations in transition metal chemistry, Janet et al.
proposed54 an ad hoc set of 25 mixed continuous discrete metal-local (MCDL-25) descriptors for supervised learning (i.e., ANN) prediction of properties of octahedral complexes with midrow transition metals. The MCDL-25 descriptors included one-hot encoded metal and coordinating atom identities, metal-local ligand atom electronegativity and bond order, all selected via LASSO feature selection on the data set.

The most nonlocal measure included was the truncated Kier
shape index497 that measured the rigidity and branching of the ligands via the number of two-bond paths formed by the atoms. Graph-based representations such as Moreau−Broto auto
correlations498 were first introduced 40 years ago for use in organic chemistry cheminformatics. In the mid-2000s, Burello
et al. proposed499 path-based descriptors tailored for bidentate phosphine ligands to be used in machine learning models (Figure 44). Examples of these tailored, ad hoc descriptors
included the minimum path distance between phosphorus atoms, the number of rotatable bonds, and the mass of atoms within three bonds of the chelating phosphorus atoms (Figure 44). Systematic sets of graph-based descriptors were proposed
by Janet et al.500 as extensions of Moreau−Broto autocorre
lation (AC) functions52,498,500,501 to develop the revised autocorrelation (RAC) representation for transition-metal chemistry. Standard ACs have the form:
P PP (d , d)
d
ij
i j ij
=∑∑ δ
(1)
where P is a heuristic, tabulated property and dij is the distance separating two atoms on the molecular graph. Five heuristic properties typically used in ACs are (i) nuclear charge, Z, (ii) Pauling electronegativity, χ, motivated by its importance in
MCDL-25,54 (iii) topology, T, which is the atom’s
coordination number, (iv) identity, I, that is 1 for any atom, as suggested in ref 501, and (v) covalent atomic radius, S. Other heuristic properties that have been used include the
atomic polarizability.384 These atomic properties can be correlated, but recent analysis has indicated including them can be useful to encode distinct aspects of elements in the
periodic table.502 RACs are an extension of ACs to include both products and differences on the molecular graph. To capture the centrality of the metal and its coordination environment in determining properties of a transition-metal complex, the convention of
RACs also introduced the selection of scope,52 i.e., by choosing which atoms to sum over, such as equatorial versus axial ligands (Figure 45). RACs also include metal-centered (mc) or
ligand-centered (lc) RACs, in which one of the atoms in the AC expression is always a metal center or ligand coordinating atom, respectively (Figure 45). Finally, a chief distinction of RACs is the inclusion of property differences rather than products, which are nontrivial only for a minimum d of 1 and apply only to lc or mc RACs:
P (P P) (d , d)
d
ij
i j ij
lc/mc ax/eq/all
lc or mc scope
′=∑ ∑ − δ
(2)
where scope is chosen to be all ligands or averaged over a subset (i.e., equatorial or axial). Extension of RACs to other materials has also motivated definition of new scopes, as described next. In total, there are six types of standard ACs and RACs (i.e., full averaged over all, axial, or equatorial; lc averaged over axial or equatorial; and mc averaged over all). For a given cutoff d and five heuristic properties, there are 42d + 10 RACs. Observations on small organic molecule data sets

(i.e., QM9503) has typically motivated500 the truncation of the expansion of standard ACs and RACs to a depth of three bond paths (i.e., d = 3). Unlike MCDL-25 or other metalnearsighted representations, information about the full molecule is still included in the expansions of ACs and RACs. However, specific properties of atoms more than three bonds apart are not included in most RAC descriptors. To this set of graph-based descriptors, a number of one-hot descriptors are added,500 including ligand denticity and spin or oxidation state of the metal. Eliminating RACs that are invariant in the data set typically (e.g., for mononuclear octahedral transition metal complexes) produces a 155-dimensional feature set known as RAC-155.500 A number of three-dimensional representations have been widely used in organic chemistry and occasionally applied to open-shell transition-metal chemistry, and we briefly review some of them here. One popular whole-molecule representation is the Coulomb Matrix (CM).504 The off-diagonal elements of the CM are the products of the ith and jth atoms’ nuclear charges, Z, scaled by their separation (i.e., ZiZj/
rij), and the diagonal terms are heuristically fit to 0.5Zi2.4. The CM representation has strong size-dependence, requiring padding with zeros up to number of atoms in the largest molecule studied, which can challenge chemical discovery efforts where the system size is not known a priori. This sizedependence is particularly problematic for transition metal complex properties (e.g., spin, catalytic) that depend much more on the metal-local environment and less on the size. The CM also depends on the order of atoms in the molecule. Alternative 3D descriptors have been proposed and used particularly in organic chemistry. These include the Bag of Bonds (BoB) descriptor, which groups interactions by the pairwise atom types and distances involved and computes CMlike interactions among them.505 Other functions have explicit distance decay around local atomic environments, making them amenable to development of force fields not discussed in this review, and avoid the strong size-dependence of the CM. These include the smooth overlap of atomic position (SOAP)506 representation, the SLATM507 representation, and the many-body tensor representation (MBTR).508 Because all of these representations require geometries before their calculation, their utility in transition metal chemistry is limited
to closed shell transition metal complexes where low-cost (e.g., semiempirical) models provide an adequate initial geometry. Distance-dependent modifications to RACs have also been
proposed to partially account for structure dependence.509 The Coulomb-decay RAC (CD-RAC) representation was proposed for prediction of properties of both equilibrium and distorted
molecular structures509 as follows:

where the d = 0 term adopts the functional form of the CM diagonal, d > 0 terms incorporate explicit internuclear dependence, and both types of terms are normalized by the number of atoms, n, to limit size dependence. The heuristic properties encoded by CD-RACs can be the same as standard
RACs, but modified heuristics have also been proposed509 to increase transferability, including the number of valence electrons (e.g., five for N and six for O), and the number of bonds the neutral element should form based on the octet rule (e.g., four for C and three for N). Tailored representations have been developed for periodic
MOFs. One-hot encoding of functional groups,510 geometric
descriptors of pore volume and surface area,510−512 or
energetic descriptors from evaluation with probe molecules513 have been employed in gas separation models. An extension to
SMILES or InChI has been proposed514 to generalize these string expressions for more universal naming and categorization of MOFs (Figure 46). Both string types preserve the domains of SBU and linker that are normally used in describing MOF chemistry (Figure 46). Molecular graph
based RACs498,500,501 have been generalized for periodic
MOFs384 with an expanded heuristic set that included atomic polarizabilities. MOFs are divided into the metal node SBUs, linkers, and functional groups (FGs). Metal-centered RACs are computed on the SBUs, linker-only RACs are computed both over the full linker and centered on coordinating atoms, and FG (i.e., non-C or H atoms in the linker) RACs are computed
centered on the FG heavy atoms.384

Representations based on atom-counting, compositional515
features, or one-hot encoding of bond/atom types516,517 and
functional groups only510 have also been developed for MOFs. While 3D geometric representations have been less widely employed in the context of MOFs, atomic-property-weighted

where B is a smoothing parameter, rij is the minimum distance of atoms within a certain radius R inside the unit cell, and f is a normalization factor. These descriptors are evaluated over all pairs in the entire MOF unit cell, and the properties P evaluated typically include tabulated electronegativity, polarizability, and van der Waals volume. A challenge in representations for inorganic bonding is the extent to which models should be transferable across electronic states, including molecular charge or metal oxidation and spin states, as well as across groups or rows of the periodic table. While this remains an outstanding challenge for machine learning representation development as a whole, it is particularly relevant for transition-metal chemistry. One approach that researchers have adopted to sidestep this challenge is to use electronic-structure-based descriptors as inputs to ML models, typically improving transferability but at the computational cost of an electronic structure calculation as part of ML model evaluation. Many such descriptors are similar to those described for QSPRs (see section 4.2.1). In addition, tailored representations applied to machine learning in transition-metal chemistry have included properties of the
metal-centered gradient519 and metal charge,519−521 orbital coefficients and matrix elements from approximate electronic
structure,522,523 HOMO−LUMO gaps,491,521 vibrational fre
quencies,521 or components from energy decomposition
analysis.524
4.4.2. Supervised Learning Regression Models. Although supervised ML has been receiving increasing interest in recent years, the earliest ML regression models applied to transition-metal chemistry were developed nearly 20 years
ago.491,520,525 Burello and Rothenberg used QM descriptors (e.g., frontier orbital energies and structural descriptors) to train models to predict experimental catalytic activity of Pdbased cross-coupling catalysts, including with awareness of solvent effects. Available training sets were around 500 experimental results (e.g., TOF and TON) and could be
predicted well by the models (Figure 47).491,525 They showed that while a range of models were suitable (e.g., decision trees, linear regression, ANNs), considerably smaller residuals were
obtained with the nonlinear ANN models (Figure 47).491 Once trained, the ANN models could then be used to screen a large space of candidate catalysts at the cost of only DFT-level
evaluation491 (see section 5). Janet et al. trained ANNs to predict the spin-splitting
energies of midrow transition-metal complexes.54 They used an ad hoc, metal-local descriptor set (MCDL-25, see section 4.4.1) to increase transferability of the models across a range of
transition-metal complex sizes.54 The performance of the models was balanced across the Cr−Ni M(II)/M(III)
complexes studied.54 The ANN models accurately predict trends in spin-splitting with ligand field strength (e.g., as in the spectrochemical series) for the full range of M(II)/M(III) (M
= Cr−Ni) metals studied (Figure 48).54 The models were trained on DFT data (ca. 1000 complexes using common ligands from inorganic chemistry) from a range of Hartree−

Fock exchange fractions to account for the sensitivity of spinsplitting predictions to DFT functional choice. Models were both trained to predict the exchange sensitivity and to enumerate different lead compounds with changed exchange
fraction (see Figure 18).34,54 ANN test set performance (MAE: 2.5 kcal/mol, RMSE: 3.0 kcal/mol) was generally within 1 credible interval, which they estimated from Monte Carlo
dropout,526 of the DFT ground-truth result (Figure 48). The models also outperformed whole-molecule descriptors (e.g., the Coulomb matrix) by at least an order of magnitude for the
same data set size.54 Tests on out-of-distribution (i.e., larger complexes from the CSD) complexes, however, revealed an
increase in errors due to differences from training data.54 Given the high degree of feature engineering in MCDL-25, Janet et al. showed feature-space distance could be used to distinguish when ANN performance would be poor on out-of-distribution
points.54
Janet et al. trained ANN527 and KRR500 models to predict spin-splitting energies with the graph-based, RAC representa
tion (see section 4.4.1). The RAC-155/ANN527 or RAC-155/
KRR500 models improved upon the performance of MCDL-25
(Figure 48).500 The best-performing RAC-155 models500 achieved subkcal/mol test MAE on comparably sized data sets to the MCDL-25/ANN model (Figure 48). Feature
selection preserved the good performance of the RACs while reducing the number of descriptors to a size comparable to
MCDL-25 (Figure 48).500 PCA of this feature-selected subset indicated that by eliminating nonlocal features from the full RAC set, complexes with distinct sizes due to distal variation but otherwise comparable spin splitting were more proximal in
PC space of the reduced representation (Figure 49).500 In comparison, the full RAC-155 or a poor-performing wholemolecule representation placed the same points very far from each other, making it more challenging for ANNs to learn the
structure−property mapping (Figure 49).500 An approach to predict dynamic correlation energies (e.g., MP2 corrections to HF) from KRR models trained on orbital-based descriptors was also demonstrated on transition-metal complexes from this
data set.523 Other applications focused on open-shell systems have additionally used geometry-dependent descriptors. ML models (i.e., ridge regression) have been trained to interpolate the potential energy surface for mononuclear Fe single-molecule
magnet (SMM) candidates.528 These models reduced the computational cost to identify optimal structural properties in
designing single-ion magnetic anisotropy.528 Using experimental data sets, LASSO models have also been developed to design SMMs with a large isothermal magnetic entropy

change.529 On the basis of a set of 60 datamined experimentally synthesized SMMs, heuristic descriptors, such as size, number, and type of metal ions, were used as inputs to the LASSO model for both feature selection and model
prediction.529 Gaussian processes have also been used to predict the exchange−spin coupling between copper centers in a small set (ca. 250) of dicopper complexes, with good performance achieved on a range of distance-dependent descriptors from heuristics (e.g., Cu distance) to more sophisticated ML descriptors (e.g., SOAP, see section
4.4.1).530 As a demonstration of the benefit of avoiding structurebased descriptors, graph-based descriptors have been
used34,54,499,500 to rapidly predict geometric properties relevant to transition-metal catalysis and to overcome limitations in the cost and accuracy of physics-based models (see section 2.5). The bite angle or flexibility (i.e., range of low-energy bite angles) of bidentate phosphine ligands were predicted by ML
models trained on a tailored set of topological descriptors.499 Given a small training set of 65 ligands from the CSD and limited number (ca. 19 after PCA selection) of input features, these early ANN demonstrations consisted of a small number
of nodes (ca. 4−7) and only one hidden layer.499 Despite the simplicity, these models exhibited good performance on
validation data (R2 = 0.84−0.9).499 Janet et al. trained ANNs to predict DFT-derived equilibrium bond lengths of transition-metal complexes in a
spin- and oxidation-state-dependent manner.54,500 The data set consisted of 1350 hybrid-DFT-geometry-optimized mononuclear octahedral transition-metal complexes with midrow, 3d transition metals (Cr−Ni) and common ligands used in
inorganic chemistry. Using the sparse, ad hoc MCDL-2554 descriptor set to train a fully connected ANN with two hidden layers, bond lengths were predicted to 0.02−0.03 Å MAE on set-aside test molecules for both low-spin and high-spin states. ANNs trained with 2−3 hidden layers on a 155-dimensional set of RACs plus denticity and oxidation/spin-state informa
tion500 improved these test errors to sub-0.01 Å on average
(Figure 2).34 These models were implemented in the
molSimplify53,55 code’s structure generation module531 includ
ing in a web front end532 to enable rapid structure prediction by force fields for organic components and the ANNs for the metal−organic bond length (Figure 2). KRR models trained on feature-selected subsets achieved comparable errors to the
ANNs.54,500 Consistent with the symmetry of transition-metal complexes in the training data, the RAC-155/ANN models predict both an averaged equatorial bond length and two independent axial bond lengths. As a result, these ML models encoded the metals and ligands where Jahn−Teller distortion will be present by accurately predicting asymmetry in these
bond lengths.34 In a related approach, neural network potentials (NNPs) have been developed for some solid-state materials that can exhibit redox or spin state switching, in which case changes in bond length for this single NNP model
have been ascribed to changes in oxidation or spin state.533 ML regression models (e.g., ANNs and Gaussian process regression or GPRs) have been trained on moderately sized
(ca. 2000 points) data sets (e.g., the MNSol database534) for
predicting solvation free energies535,536 (i.e., in numerous
solvents) and redox potentials537 predominantly for organic molecules. ANNs trained to predict DFT-derived transitionmetal complex redox potentials have demonstrated good performance (ca. 0.2−0.3 eV) even on small (ca. 200−300
points) data sets (Figure 48).34,500 Models trained on RACs or on MCDL-25 have been used to predict the adiabatic ionization potential as well as the solvent- and thermocorrected redox potential of midrow transition-metal complexes (Figure 48). As in the case of spin splitting, the best performance has been obtained with feature-selected subsets of
RACs,500 and performance for predicting redox potential and ionization potential were comparable (Figure 48). Using a similar data set, Nandy et al. developed both KRR and ANN models on RACs for predicting the HOMO, LUMO, and HOMO−LUMO gap of midrow transition-metal
complexes.55 They observed comparable (ca. 0.2−0.3 eV) model errors from a RAC-155/ANN and KRR models trained
on feature-selected subsets.55 For the KRR models, they used random-forest-ranked recursive feature addition (RF-RFA)

both to improve model performance and to analyze important features.55 Liu et al. built models across a larger set of 4500 transition-metal complexes with a greater diversity in ligand chemistry and size, achieving comparable errors on HOMO level and HOMO−LUMO gap prediction.538 They generalized538 this ML approach to fractional occupation number (FON) DFT properties to accurately predict the degree of MR character with a RAC-155/ANN (Figure 50). Enumeration of a large space of 187k candidate transition-metal complexes was used to identify ligands and metals that corresponded to strong MR character (Figure 50).538 Redox potential and frontier orbital properties are also frequently used to rationalize and design catalysts. Nandy et al. trained ML models on RACs to predict open-shell transitionmetal catalyst reaction energies (i.e., oxo formation) for methane-to-methanol conversion.468 The models achieved good accuracy (ca. 4 kcal/mol) for predicting the reaction energetics, enabling both enumerative study of 37k catalysts as well as screening for design principles. This combined ML
model prediction and feature analysis approach with RACs has also been demonstrated on iridium catalysts for H2 splitting
(Figure 51).539 In this case, RAC-trained models performed well for predicting barrier heights and feature analysis revealed opportunities for design of catalysts with lowered barriers (Figure 51).539
The HOMO level is often suggested448 as a heuristic in methane-to-methanol catalyst screening, but ML models have revealed a poor correlation between these two quantities when the range of metals and ligands considered is large.468 Analysis of RF-RFA-selected features with KRR models for oxo formation energy and HOMO level prediction revealed differences in feature importance for these two properties (Figure 52).468 The HOMO level depended much more on metal-distant RACs, highlighting its expected size dependence, whereas the oxo formation energy was metal-local (Figure 52).468 The selected features for oxo formation energy shared more commonalities with those essential for predicting spin splitting, which was consistent with observations of strong

spin-state dependence in catalyst reactivity (Figure 52 and see section 4.2). Despite some limitations for large-scale screening, HOMO prediction models have been proposed for use in catalyst design involving a single metal and oxidation state. Chang et al.496 trained ML models to predict the HOMO level for tungsten benzylidyne photoredox catalysts because this quantity has been related to experimental redox potentials (Figure 53). After comparing several ML model types (e.g., LASSO, Gaussian processes, and ANNs) trained on Hammett parameter heuristics, ANNs were observed to perform best at predicting DFT-level HOMO energetics (Figure 53).496
Using structure-dependent descriptors, Meyer et al.540 devised an ML-model-accelerated approach for volcano-based (see section 4.2) screening of cross-coupling catalysts. First, they trained KRR models on a range of conventional organic chemistry descriptors to predict a representative free energy in the cross-coupling reactions (Figure 54). On these complexes
with late transition metals (e.g., Pd, Cu, and Au), they used semiempirically optimized geometries to evaluate the structure-dependent features. Consistent with observations from
Janet et al. on spin-splitting energies,54,500 they observed poor performance of the Coulomb matrix representation in learning curves up to around 7000 catalysts (Figure 54). The bag of bonds (BoB, see section 4.4.1) and similar fragment-oriented structural descriptors achieved the highest accuracies up to 2.5 kcal/mol MAE, with some metal dependence likely attributable to poorer structure generation for earlier metals (e.g., Ni,
Figure 54).540 This approach has also been used for screening other Ni catalysts for reductive cleavage in aryl ether
compounds.541 In recent years, ML regression models have also been extensively applied to experimental data sets as a generalization of QSPRs (section 4.2) often using similar QM descriptors. In these cases, the combined DFT calculations and ML models tend to outperform standard physics-based modeling but require considerable calculation time in comparison to models trained on heuristic descriptors. Denmark and co-workers used descriptors of sterics and the electrostatic potential (i.e., similar
to those proposed by Lipkowitz and co-workers414) to train supervised ML models (i.e., ANNs and support vector machines, SVMs) to predict enantioselective organocatalysts for chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed thiol addition to N
acylimines.542,543 To avoid extrapolation, the training subset was selected to uniformly cover the space spanned by the input features. The model’s performance was sensitive to the data balance in the necessarily small training set accessible to a
synthetic chemist.543 The predicted free energy changes from the best-performing ANN models exceeded what could typically be obtained from DFT-based screening alone and enabled prediction of new catalysts with up to 99%
enantioselectivity.542,543 Others have shown that graph-based descriptors (e.g., Kier shape index used in MCDL-25) that have been demonstrated for open-shell transition-metal complex ML are as important as steric- or charge-based descriptors (e.g., in prediction of experimental ethylene
polymerization catalysts).544
Doyle and co-workers predicted the yield of catalysts545,546 for cases (e.g., Pd C−N cross-coupling on substrates containing five-membered rings) where traditional approaches to performance improvement had failed. Using highthroughput experimentation, they trained random forest

models on DFT-derived descriptors to predict reaction
yields.545 Feature selection in conjunction with nonlinear models (i.e., the random forest model) outperformed linear models, but ANNs provided limited benefit on these small data
sets.545 It has been debated the extent to which the descriptors used allowed the models to generalize to unseen chemical
entities.547,548 LASSO models have also been trained on a similar series of QM descriptors (e.g., HOMO−LUMO gaps, charges, and frequencies) to predict the reaction yields of
tungsten epoxidation catalysts to good accuracy.521 The benefit of QM charge descriptors to improve predictive capabilities on small data sets echo earlier observations made for ML models (e.g., decision trees and SVMs) trained on a series of ligand descriptors (e.g., partial charges and shape or connectivity) to predict the molecular weight of polymers generated by
polymerization catalysts.520 Iterative approaches to catalyst design that merge experimental, DFT-based, and data-driven models have been
pursued. For example, Maley et al. trained549 random forest models with heuristic properties of transition-state geometries
to predict DFT barrier heights in Cr-catalyzed olefin oligomerization. They interpreted the feature importance in these models to identify key ligand factors correlated strongly to barrier height and exploited them to identify ligands that would enable selective formation of octene over hexene (Figure 55). Through this process, they improved the catalyst
selectivity to high levels549 (Figure 55). Others have used interaction energies from energy decomposition analysis to accurately predict experimental activation energies with ML models and have observed these features to be as important as conventional (e.g., steric, frontier orbital energy, or charge)
descriptors.524 Data-driven models have also been developed to predict a combination of experimental catalytic quantities that would be challenging to obtain from DFT-based energetic analysis. Using kinetic characteristics of the catalysts as inputs to train a
multitask ANN, Rizkin et al.550 built a model to predict the average molecular weights, polydispersity, and reactor temperature for zirconocene-catalyzed olefin polymerization. Siebert
et al.551 built random forest models to identify optimal reaction

temperature, time, catalyst loading, and concentrations for CO2 reduction with ruthenium catalysts.
Considerable effort has been made toward supervised learning of the properties of solid-state, inorganic materials owing to the large data sets of DFT calculations available. For example, early efforts used these data sets and ad hoc
descriptors to predict thermodynamic stability552 and elec
tronic properties.553 More recently, graph-convolutional neural networks and graph-based representations have been used to
predict properties with improved accuracy.554,555 We next focus on MOF ML model predictions given the close connections of MOFs to molecular transition-metal complexes. A number of ML regression models of MOF properties have been developed using tailored representations described in section 4.4.1. A range of models (e.g., support vector regression, SVR, ridge regression, and random forest) were trained on one-hot compositional features for very small experimental data sets (ca. 100 points) of MOF CO2 and H2 adsorption curves, but small data set sizes have limited
performance.517 Instead, most predictive MOF models have focused on predicting grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)simulated gas uptake characteristics on hypothetically enumerated MOFs from compositional and structural information in order to accelerate exhaustive screening efforts. SVR models were trained on a subset of 120k hypothetical MOFs featurized with geometric descriptors (i.e., AP-RDFs) to
predict uptake of CO2 and methane from GCMC.518 The SVRs outperformed standard MLR models. While wholestructure, geometric descriptors were sufficient to yield predictive models for methane, the AP-RDFs that encode chemical composition were needed to yield improved (R2 = 0.75) models for predicting CO2 uptake. Work with training random forest and KRR models on graph-based descriptors across a range of hypothetical MOF data sets has reaffirmed the observation that chemical composition information is key to prediction of CO2 uptake at low pressure but less essential
with high pressure or for predicting methane uptake.384,516 Analysis of feature importance in these predictions in particular
highlighted the importance of the metal SBU chemistry,384 emphasizing limited transferability of MOF ML models to new
SBUs not in the training set (Figure 56).518 Indeed, earlier
feature importance analysis applied to the role of topology and functionalization in MOFs (e.g., electron-donating and withdrawing groups) in a carefully constructed data set that limited variation of the metal SBU had instead indicated that geometry played a dominant role in determining relative gas uptake of
CO2, H2, and N2.510 Despite the good performance of geometric descriptors on
methane uptake, Pardakthi et al.515 showed that compositional information further improved predictions, with very good performance for methane uptake prediction (R2 = 0.97) on the
HMOF data set556 by random forest models trained on both structural and chemical (i.e., elemental composition, bond
types) information (Figure 57).515 Random forest models outperformed alternatives such as SVRs or a single binary
decision tree (Figure 57).515 While most described models for MOF property prediction have favored random forests or ANNs and use heuristic compositional and structural descriptors, alternatives have also
been pursued. In a hybrid approach, Bucior et al.514 developed a descriptor-based screening with a probe H2 molecule, in close analogy to the steric map approaches used for transition-metal complex QSPR. These models involved evaluation of H2 adsorption energies on a grid in the MOF materials and
used these energies as inputs to a LASSO regression model.514 The evaluation of interaction energies could be carried out on a coarse 1 Å grid but still required more time to compute than heuristic descriptors. Models are typically judged based on prediction errors on a set-aside test set, and an outstanding challenge is in quantifying uncertainty of a model for generalization to new compounds in chemical discovery (see section 5). For highly engineered feature sets, distances of new compounds to the training data
in feature space has been used in ML property prediction.54,557 The popularity, flexibility, and performance of ANNs with numerous hidden layers that effectively carry out feature engineering motivate alternative approaches to uncertainty quantification (UQ). Ensembles of models trained on distinct
partitions are sometimes used,527,558−560 and the Monte Carlo
dropout526 approach where uncertainty is estimated from different ANN architectures (i.e., with zeroed out nodes) has
also been applied in transition-metal complex ML models.54

Janet et al. showed527 the distance in the latent space of an ANN to be a superior, low-cost strategy to detecting high-error points, especially for discovery applications where standard methods (e.g., ensembles) would be overconfident. Calibration of this distance with maximum likelihood estimation enables conversion of the distance to a confidence interval on the property prediction. Optimization of the properties of organic molecules in continuous (i.e., latent space) representations and inversion back to discrete candidates has also been demonstrated as a useful tool for molecular discovery.561 More recently, the distance in latent space has been shown to be useful for experimental catalyst optimization562 and demonstrated for accelerated discovery with active learning563,564 (see section 5.2).
4.4.3. Classification and Semi-supervised Learning Models. Although the majority of machine learning efforts in transition-metal chemistry have been focused on regression for property prediction, there are a number of cases where alternative models have been developed for classification. We briefly summarize these approaches, including those focused
on binary classification as well as emerging techniques in semisupervised learning for both regression and classification of materials in which only some of the data labels are known beforehand. Classifiers and semisupervised learning models have been developed for artificial-intelligence-informed workflow decisions,519,565 as presented in more detail in section 5.3. In binary classification tasks, the model output is a score ranging from 0 (false) to 1 (true). The models most widely employed are SVM and ANN classifiers. Typically, a threshold of 0.5 on the output score is used to assign each data point to a class. The overall performance of the model is captured by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that indicates the rate of false positives as the threshold is adjusted to increase the rate of true positives. When the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC approaches 1, the model is robust in a manner that is less sensitive to the threshold chosen to assign the classes. In certain cases, classification model scores can be interpreted as probabilities and therefore can be used for uncertainty quantification. Duan et al. observed519 ANNs to generalize better than SVMs in some classification tasks, but

application of ANN classifiers to diverse molecules suggested raw probability scores were overconfident. This observation led
them to introduce519 an alternative uncertainty quantification metric they termed the latent space entropy (LSE):

j i
( ) (j)
∑
=− ̃ ̃
(5)
where the LSE measures the proximity of the training data in each class, j, and ranges from 0 for perfect confidence to ln(2) = 0.693 for no confidence. The confidence is low when the point is close to the model’s decision boundary in latent space or when it is distant from all points even those within the same class. An early example of classification in transition-metal chemistry is the development of models that could predict transition-metal binding sites in metalloenzymes from the protein’s structure without the metal present (i.e., the
apoenzyme).566 This approach was motivated by the much higher availability of structures of a protein without the metal resolved in the apoenzyme in comparison to those with the metal bound. Decision trees and SVM classifiers were trained on a series of geometric and sequence-based descriptors for 125 protein chains with 367 known metal binding sites, and the models achieved a low rate of false positives (i.e., 95%
selectivity).566 The phenomenon of spin-crossover poses a straightforward question for classification models, and SCO complexes in the CSD represent a rich source of data for ML models because crystal structures solved at multiple temperatures give access to
strongly spin-state-dependent bond lengths.567 Comparison of approximate DFT bond lengths to experimental bond lengths
usually yields good agreement131,150,162 (see section 2). Taylor et al. leveraged ML-predicted DFT bond lengths to assess and
classify experimental spin states in the CSD.568 This model improved upon purely energetic predictions of ground-state spins from approximate DFT functionals and correctly classified (i.e., high-spin vs low-spin) 96% of experimental structures based on the similarity of the CSD metal−ligand
bond length to the ML-predicted DFT value.568 Cundari et al. employed bond lengths from around 100 CSD complexes to
build small neural network classifiers.569 However, over the small data set size, classification models based on Bayesian inference performed better to determine relationships between M−N bond lengths and M−N−C angles in transition-metal
imidos.569 Classifiers have also been developed to separate good and
bad materials characteristics for CO2 uptake by MOFs.570 The
classification task consisted of distinguishing MOFs capable of greater than 1 mmol/g CO2 uptake at low pressure (i.e., 0.15
bar CO2). The SVM models for this classification task were trained on 10% of 324 000 hypothetical MOFs generated for
the study and featurized with AP-RDFs.518 This approach could be used to accelerate prescreening of MOFs for improved gas uptake characteristics in hypothetical databases
(see section 5).570 Semi-supervised learning techniques have yet to be widely employed in materials or transition-metal chemistry. The term “semi-supervised” refers broadly to methods where a mixture of initially labeled and unlabeled data is employed, and the
remainder of labels get assigned during model training.571 In one example, researchers have combined clustering with supervised learning in a two-step semisupervised approach to
image classification for labeling X-ray diffraction images relevant to high-throughput experimentation in materials
science.572 In analysis of the materials literature with natural language processing, where explicit labeling of extracted results can be challenging, a two-step semisupervised approach was also recently demonstrated for extraction of magnetic phase
transition temperatures573 and for materials synthesis proce
dures (e.g., with a random forest classifier).574 Still more applications of semisupervised learning are anticipated as a way to overcome limitations in the availability high-quality, unambiguous data in transition-metal chemistry, some of which are discussed in detail in section 5.3. Within semisupervised learning models, such as for training
of ANN classifiers with partially labeled data,565 a related concern is the effect of the amount of labeled data on model prediction. For chemical problems, models have been shown to
be fairly insensitive to this labeling threshold,565 and the high cost of data generation may motivate lower thresholds for labeling. For some supervised and semisupervised learning models where the classification task is based on an arbitrary
cutoff,565,570 the ROC may also not be the optimal method for assessing model performance. Instead, some have quantified
how well the model separates the two classes565 using Bhattacharyya distance to measure the differences in the distributions of the two classes.
5. TRANSITION-METAL CHEMICAL SPACE EXPLORATION
Thus far, we have described iterative, mechanistic search (section 4.2) where a transition-metal complex that addresses most design objectives may be known but requires some improvements. Conversely, when good design principles are not known, alternative approaches have been used to evaluate a larger space of feasible compounds as candidate materials or catalysts. If the scoring and evaluation of materials is efficient (e.g., with low-cost computation or surrogate models), expansive, combinatorial evaluation of all materials on a large scale (ca. 1000s to millions of compounds) is often carried out (section 5.1). When seeking to identify materials that satisfy design objectives without carrying out unproductive experiment or computation, single- and multiobjective optimization with evolutionary algorithms (section 5.2) has been widely employed to guide experiment, computation, or MLaccelerated discovery.
5.1. Combinatorial Enumeration
In contrast with the functionalization and small-scale ligand permutation studies discussed in section 4.2, we refer here to combinatorial enumeration that generates a search space of at least several thousand transition-metal complexes or materials. The reticular nature of metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) combined with the relatively low cost of evaluating their properties with molecular mechanics force fields (i.e., for gas separations characteristics) has led to a large number of enumerative studies on MOFs over the past two deca
des,510,556,575−581 as reviewed in detail in ref 578. When previously synthesized secondary building units (i.e., metal nodes) are combined with synthetically accessible linkers and then functionalized, they can easily yield large sets (ca. 100k or
more) of hypothetical MOF materials.556 Early efforts in this area were limited to straightforward-to-enumerate combina
tions that led to primitive cubic unit cells,556,575 whereas later
studies expanded to generalize to noncubic unit cells.577

Given the possible ways to combine linkers, functional groups, and metal SBUs, more focused approaches have also been used. Functional group variation has been used to create a combinatorially large (ca. 10k or more) space for screening materials with improved characteristics (e.g., for CO2 capture)
even when the metal SBU is held fixed.580 For gas separation, it is also expected that the pore structure and overall topology should play key roles, motivating a focus on the underlying
MOF connectivity.577,579,581 Gómez-Gualdrón et al. focused on the relationship between MOF topology and gas adsorption characteristics, identifying overall structures most suited for
hydrogen storage in the ToBACCo MOF data set.579,582 Similar strategies were previously applied to generating
hypothetical porous polymer network materials583 and, even
earlier, zeolites.584 By sampling distinct crystal structures and
ring size distributions in porous zeolite materials,584 Deem and co-workers built a database of 2.7 million hypothetical zeolites, a dramatically larger number than have ever been successfully
synthesized.585 These enumerated sets (e.g., of MOFs) are often used for large-scale screening (i.e., with grand canonical Monte Carlo)
of gas uptake properties. For example, Boyd et al.576 screened a space of 325k hypothetical MOFs for CO2 working capacity
and selectivity of binding relative to water. They identified design characteristics of the top 8k materials, finally identifying the MOFs that looked synthetically accessible and were subsequently demonstrated to experimentally have the
computationally predicted performance.576 Given the large number of materials that can be generated in this way, it is possible to identify numerous design leads and use intuition to address questions regarding stability or synthetic accessibility. More recently, machine learning models have been increasingly applied to the development of interpretable design rules from these sets (see section 5.2.3). One concern for the use of enumerative sets is the extent to which design leads or design principles are sensitive to the data set employed for their extraction. Moosavi and co-workers
observed384 that the CoRE-MOF database of experimentally synthesized materials exhibits key distinctions from most of these hypothetical MOF sets (Figure 56). Using t-SNE maps of MOF materials in graph-based representations (i.e., RACs) extended for metal−organic frameworks in combination with geometric descriptors, they analyzed the similarity of experimental and hypothetical MOFs over specific domains (i.e., the SBU vs linker or functional group). Some observed distinctions could be expected, such as that pores were larger
in some hypothetical data sets (i.e., ToBaCCo582) that had emphasized distinct topologies not synthetically accessible. While greater diversity of hypothetical over synthesized materials was expected, the hypothetical MOFs also interestingly lacked some diversity observed in experimental MOFs (Figure 56). In particular, the SBUs sampled in hypothetical sets are often much narrower than those that have been experimentally synthesized. While demonstrated on MOFs, these observations highlight the general challenges for combinatorial enumeration of inorganic materials in avoiding bias when proposing new materials while maintaining some realism. In comparison to MOFs or small organic molecules, fewer efforts have been made to elucidate rules for enumeration of feasible transition-metal complexes. In organic chemistry, the
generated database (GDB)586 series has enumerated molecules up to discrete numbers of heavy (i.e., non-H) atom sizes under
the constraints of obeying the octet rule and being in closedshell singlet states with no net charge. Subsets of the GDB with seven to nine heavy atoms have been widely employed to
generate data sets503,587 for ML of properties of organic molecules and for high-throughput screening. Enumerative strategies for transition-metal complexes are less well developed. In one example, a small-scale study of hypothetical modified cyclopentadienyl ligands (e.g., all-nitrogen or allphosphorus rings) was used to understand the mechanism of
mononuclear single-molecule magnet behavior.588 Because the smallest nontrivial octahedral complex has at least seven heavy atoms due to the ligands and has more electrons than a typical organic molecule due to the metal center, exhaustive generation of very small transition-metal complexes has
motivated a distinct strategy.589 Gugler et al. constrained the search of individual ligands to a small number (ca. 1 or 2) of heavy atoms per metalcoordinating site (e.g., four heavy atoms in a bidentate ligand) and relaxed typically applied constraints (e.g., for the GDB) in generating ligands with one to four heavy (i.e., C, N, O, P, or
S) atoms.589 They assigned more favorable scores to neutral and octet-rule-obeying molecules but still allowed for exceptions, producing an octahedral homoleptic ligand data
base, OHLDB,589 with DFT properties of 1250 complexes formed with midrow transition metals (i.e., Cr−Co). The enumeration of lower-symmetry heteroleptic complexes
directly with these ligands or by exploiting ligand additivity60 leads to hundreds of thousands of complexes. These data sets have been used to improve ML model performance on larger
complexes.589 Exhaustive enumeration of transition-metal complexes has also been carried out in a stepwise fashion for larger bidentate ligands. In 2006, Rothenberg and co-workers hypothesized that generating bidentate ligands from a series of rings, bridging, and functional groups could rapidly lead to vast (ca. 1.7 billion) transition-metal complex spaces infeasible for full-scale
exploration (Figure 58).590 Instead, they focused on the
properties of 600 representative complexes from this larger space for which they carried out force field optimization and further characterization of figures of merit (i.e., experimental
turnover frequency, Figure 43). More recently, Janet et al.563 started from well-studied five- and six-membered ring motifs with common coordinating atoms (i.e., N or O), modified (i.e.,

with changes in conjugation or additional heteroatoms) the rings, and bridged them to generate nearly 800 unique core bidentate ligand types. Sequential functionalization and homoleptic complexation with midrow transition metals generated a space of 2.8 M candidate complexes for MLaccelerated multiobjective optimization (see section 5.2.3) validated with DFT calculations.
5.2. Optimization Approaches
When aiming to discover materials or catalysts with improved properties, exhaustive enumeration of large chemical spaces is impractical and unnecessary. If we have a single, well-defined objective, evolutionary algorithms such as standard genetic algorithms (section 5.2.1) can accelerate the identification of transition-metal complexes and materials that satisfy that objective. In practice, multiple objectives must typically be satisfied (section 5.2.2). Machine learning models can accelerate single- or multiobjective optimization but introduce special challenges related to model uncertainty (section 5.2.3). Here, we briefly highlight efforts in discrete optimization with evolutionary algorithms for transition-metal complex and materials design, especially with ML-accelerated discovery. Details beyond the scope of this review regarding design, including for efforts beyond transition-metal chemistry, are provided in refs 591 and 592.
5.2.1. Genetic Algorithms. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are widely employed in transition-metal complex and broader materials discovery efforts to accelerate identification of lead
compounds that satisfy a design objective.591,592 GAs are applied to a pool of candidate materials (e.g., transition-metal complexes) with components that are represented by discrete genes. A fitness function that is a score approaching one when the material approaches the ideal property (e.g., catalyst activity) is used to determine which materials (i.e., combinations of genes) continue on to subsequent generations in a GA. Operations at each generation involve crossover of genes between parents and random mutations to avoid too rapid collapse to a local minimum. Although also used in other areas of molecular discovery, GAs are a natural fit for the modularity of transition-metal complexes, in which the genes
will often represent the metal, one or more ligand scaffolds, and functional groups attached to the ligand scaffold. This set of genes is evolved by scoring each complex with a fitness function and carrying out crossover and mutation on the topscoring subset for a number of generations. The value of GAs in accelerating screening of combinations of reaction conditions in experimental catalyst and materials screening as well as to explore large chemical spaces was
recognized over 20 years ago.593,594 Within experimental homogeneous catalysis, advances in microfluidics and highthroughput screening (e.g., with a 96-well plate) has enabled rapid catalyst optimization with a GA. Early studies carried out sequential screens of catalysts (e.g., for copolymerization), with a fast primary stage followed by slower secondary and tertiary
screens in a narrowed space of candidates.595 This highthroughput experimentation approach also enabled rapid GA evolution of catalyst chemistry and reaction conditions for
methane oxidation (Figure 59).596 A GA was used to explore genes representing variations in the catalyst metal from eight choices, 11 cocatalyst types for oxygen activation, and 13
ligands.596 To accelerate scoring, colorimetric assays were developed, to avoid time-consuming but likely more conclusive
methods (e.g., NMR) of characterization (Figure 59).596 In molecular discovery, when the objective function is explicitly calculated from electronic structure methods, it is also necessary to avoid high computational cost in evaluating each generation. For instance, in heterogeneous catalysis, GAs
have been applied to search for semiconductor alloys597 or
core−shell nanoparticle catalysts598 with favorable band gaps or catalytic activity. Here, approximate (i.e., d-band theory) methods were used in scoring, rather than more computationally demanding approaches. Within transition-metal chemistry, Chu et al. built an objective function for Grubbs-type Ru metathesis catalysts based on semiempirical PM6 descriptors in conjunction with a QSPR model capable of making DFT
quality activity predictions.599 Although representing only a proof of principle due to the small scope of ligands considered (i.e., two types of functionalized phosphines or NHCs), they showed that crossover, mutation, and selection of fittest

compounds led to the rapid selection of experimentally favored NHC ligands over alternatives, such as phosphines (Figure 60).
Foscato et al. demonstrated a more general approach to de novo complex discovery by developing ring-closure operations embedded within a genetic algorithm for the design of spin
crossover complexes.600 Starting from an initial population of 50 random complexes that were evolved for 100 generations,
the fitness of candidate Fe(II)/N octahedral complexes was evaluated at each step with an objective function based on the adiabatic spin-splitting enthalpy (Figure 61).600 Both the use of
an enthalpy and its evaluation with LFMM16,17 kept the computational cost of objective evaluation suitably low. Notably, because both graph-based and 3D information was used to introduce operations that altered the denticity of the ligands, GA optimization identified the preference for tridentate ligands over a starting population that consisted predominantly of combinations of tetradentate and bidentate ligands (Figure 61). The specific computational prediction of spin-crossover behavior for [Fe(II)(tame)2]2+ from this work was later experimentally verified, demonstrating the potential for computational design to reveal functional transition-metal complexes.601 In a similar fashion, genetic algorithms have been used to accelerate exploration of candidate MOF materials (e.g., to
maximize methane storage capacity).602 Bao et al. focused on using candidate linkers from commercially available molecules
in combination with known SBUs and MOF topologies.602 They devised a series of operations to replace and mutate linker chemistry, filtered the candidates based on geometric observations from classical molecular dynamics, and then scored and retained structures with high methane storage capacity (Figure 62).602 This procedure simultaneously increased the feasibility of the materials studied for simulation (i.e., by filtering) and reduced the total number of materials that needed to be screened by GCMC simulation.602 Similarly, Collins et al. used a GA to identify how functional group variation could alter CO2 uptake characteristics, searching a space of nearly 96k viable structures and observing significant improvement in the best-performing materials after only a few
generations of the GA.603

The large number of purely hypothetical MOFs that have been generated556 also creates a large combinatorial space to search for new materials and guide new simulations. A GA was used to accelerate discovery of hypothetical MOFs with high selectivity (i.e., over H2) for CO2 uptake (Figure 63).604 Because some properties, such as surface area or working capacity were known for all of the MOFs, the GA strategy could be validated based on its ability to find the best performers for those properties (Figure 63).604 Once validated, the GA was then used to reduce the computational effort required for the selectivity studies to only 1% of what a brute force effort would have required.604 Given their suitability for accelerating search of large combinatorial spaces, GAs have been used to optimize candidate arrays of MOFs as sensing materials by varying the individual MOF genes (i.e., from the CoRE-MOF database) and favoring MOF arrays that maximize the differences in gas uptake properties among the MOFs.605 5.2.2. Multi-Objective Optimization. Most design challenges in materials or catalysis discovery require satisfying multiple objectives. For catalysis, these concerns could be activity (i.e., turnover frequency, TOF) and stability, selectivity, solubility, or cost. As an example from heterogeneous catalysis, satisfying the objectives of cost and activity of methanation catalysts revealed an inherent trade-off in optimal properties (Figure 64).606 The hypersurface known as the Pareto front, when assessed for a two-objective optimization, consists of the points that represent the best first property (e.g., activity) for a given second property (e.g., cost). Depending on the primary concern,606 the most desirable materials may more strongly emphasize one of these two objectives. Experiment or
computation should thus aim to enrich or move beyond known Pareto front compounds with multiobjective optimization. Although GAs with composite fitness functions (i.e., by multiplying the satisfaction of multiple individual objectives) have been successfully applied to transition-metal complex
discovery,468 multiobjective optimization typically benefits from algorithms less prone to finding local minima due to the complexity of the structure−property landscape along a higher-dimensional Pareto front. Multiobjective optimization has been carried out to obtain stable, low band gap oxide polymorphs of TiO2. An evolutionary algorithm (i.e., multi
objective differential evolution or MODE) was employed to rank each generation of points based on whether they sat on the current Pareto front of these two properties evaluated with
DFT.607 Multiobjective optimization has also been applied608 to the simultaneous optimization of two types of surface area measures for gas uptake and identification of the relevant MOF topologies that maximize these two quantities. Multi-objective optimization methods have also been used in conjunction with high-throughput experimentation to simultaneously optimize conversion and selectivity of heterogeneous
catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.609 Llamas-Galilea et
al.609 employed a multiobjective algorithm (i.e., the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm-2, SPEA-2) that assigns the highest fitness scores to points along the Pareto front and maximizes diversity in the Pareto set to evolve catalyst genes consisting of elements and promoters. They observed that in comparison to a single-objective optimization of yield (i.e., a composite of selectivity and conversion), the multi-objective approach did a better job of improving both variables along the
Pareto front over six generations (Figure 65).609 Recently,
Figure 62. Approach for discovering new MOF materials with high deliverable capacity. Illustration of an algorithm for initializing a population with add or multiple add operations from a precursor library. One randomly chosen linker from the population undergoes one of seven evolution operations. The produced linker is evaluated by two filters: the number of torsions is <8, and number of sites = 2. If the linker passes these filters, molecular dynamics is used on the linker to produce a set of conformations. These linker conformations are evaluated by the two additional filters of mean pairwise angle ≥155° and a standard deviation of pairwise distance <0.5 Å. If the linker passes all filters, it is used to build a MOF of the chosen network. Finally, if the constructed MOF has a greater deliverable capacity than the lowest one in the current population, the linker is inserted into the population in rank order.

Bayesian optimization algorithms have been pursued in
chemical problems,610 especially to account for multiobjective optimization when the evaluation of fitness is relatively
costly.611
5.2.3. ML-Accelerated Discovery. Applying evolutionary algorithms to the optimization of properties in large materials
spaces requires efficient evaluation of fitness. Beyond low-cost approximate computation or cheap proxies for experimental observables, a key way to achieve faster fitness evaluation is to employ a surrogate (i.e., machine learning regression) model. When employing an ML model, optimization algorithms should be adapted to address the approximate nature of the surrogate either by restricting its use to its domain of applicability or by identifying high uncertainty points with promise in active learning. Both approaches have advantages in accelerated transition-metal complex or materials discovery, as highlighted below. ANNs were first used for bulk heterogeneous catalyst
optimization nearly 20 years ago.612−617 These early efforts in heterogeneous catalysis were focused on encoding compositional descriptors, such as element identity and stoichiometric contributions as well as adjustable scalars such as synthesis
temperature. Corma et al.613 trained an ANN to identify optimal reaction conditions at each generation in combination with high-throughput experimentation to optimize Ti zeolite catalysts for olefin epoxidation (Figure 66). The ANN predictions were used to guide GA fitness evaluation, and the optimal results predicted by the ANN-GA loop were then
validated experimentally (Figure 66).613 The diversity in the initial and subsequent pools was used to aid iterative ANN retraining to predict the rank of the catalysts for epoxidation
starting from a modest initial training set of 38 catalysts.613 GAs were frequently used in combination with ANNs because the ANN optimum is not invertible back to realistic catalyst conditions. Other applications in heterogeneous catalyst screening included the design of catalyst compositions with a

multitask network that predicted both selectivity and conversion for methane coupling614 or propane dehydrogenation as well as catalyst composition and catalyst treatment temperature for methane oxidation616 or synthesis.615 ML-accelerated discovery has similarly been applied in multiobjective optimization of materials and catalysts. In an early example, Scott et al.618 used the multiobjective NSGAII619 algorithm in conjunction with an ANN that predicted materials properties based on a binary compositional elemental representation. They used the multi-objective optimization approach to simultaneously optimize candidate quaternary
electroceramic materials for (i) their permittivity, (ii) whether the selected materials composition had a neutral, balanced
charge, and (iii) the distance to training data of the ANN.618 Experimentally, NSGA-II was used in combination with a trained ANN that detected relationships between SCO colors as inputs and the temperature to identify the minimal SCO
array for sensing applications.620 In comparison to efforts in heterogeneous catalysis, computational or experimental screening of molecular transition-metal complexes for homogeneous catalysis and materials discovery with deeper ML (i.e., beyond MLR

5k feasible spin-crossover complexes, only about 2% of which
had been seen during ANN model training.54 To ensure that the ANN prediction errors did not rise rapidly on new
compounds, they introduced557 a composite fitness function into the single-objective GA that penalized compounds distant in feature space from training data (Figure 67). Most (ca. 2/3) ANN-selected leads were validated with DFT evaluation, with
a modest increase in error (ca. 2×) over test set errors.557 In comparison, using DFT as the objective function in the GA would have taken weeks instead of minutes the ANN
required.557 This approach has also been demonstrated for exploring 10−40k transition-metal complex spaces, including
through the targeted design of HOMO−LUMO gaps55 and
discovery of C−H activation catalysts468 with stable metal-oxo moieties. In addition to model exploitation, where a trained surrogate is used to accelerate solving an optimization problem, MLaccelerated discovery of new materials and transition-metal complexes motivates active learning algorithms that focus on promising compounds where ML models are uncertain, also known as model exploration. For example, Jennings et al. used both a semiempirical approximation to DFT (i.e., effective medium theory) and an ML-accelerated GA to optimize nanoparticle alloy shape prediction and reduce the full electronic structure evaluations by around 50-fold with active
learning.621 This active learning approach is particularly useful in multi-objective optimization of materials where prior training data may be limited and search spaces are large, motivating a number of recent applications in chemical and
materials discovery.563,622−628 Several of these efforts563,623
have used the expected improvement629,630 criterion in efficient global optimization (EGO), wherein the likelihood of a new point residing beyond the Pareto front is balanced by the uncertainty of the model prediction. Because Gaussian processes (GPs) inherently provide a measure of uncertainty, they have been most widely employed in such active learning
studies,621,623,624,627 including recently in experimental catalyst
design631 or in the selection of conditions (e.g., solvents)632 for catalysis. Given the high cost of generating data within an active learning framework, many studies have only been applied to evaluating algorithms in toy problems with data sets where the ground-truth best material was already known. Such strategies have enabled comparison of leveraging surrogate models versus heuristics in active learning or other autonomous discovery
strategies.633 As an exception in which high-cost DFT data was
acquired at each generation, Janet et al.563 applied the 2D expected improvement (2D-EI) criterion in EGO for the simultaneous optimization of multiple properties of redox couples in redox flow batteries. Starting from a space of 2.8 M bulky (ca. 100−200 atom) transition-metal complexes, they simultaneously optimized the DFT-evaluated solubility in polar, nonaqueous electrolytes (i.e., with implicit-solvent calculated logP) and the solvent-corrected adiabatic redox
potential.563 Rather than using a GP, they noted that a multitask ANN exhibited better lookahead errors, i.e., the model’s performance on future generations of molecules it has
not yet seen in training.563 This suggested the ANN would
generalize better in active learning.563 By using a calibrated uncertainty metric based on distance to training data in the
model’s latent space,527 they employed the 2D-EI to select promising and uncertain points likely to expand the Pareto
front (Figure 68).563 In five generations, the Pareto front was
expanded dramatically, with each generation of 2D-EI requiring nearly a week of parallelized DFT computation to obtain 20−50 new transition-metal complex property results (Figure 68). In comparison to random search, the algorithm accelerated discovery of new leads by 500-fold, which corresponded to obtaining the same result in weeks that would have taken 50 years by brute force search (Figure 68). These accelerations generally are expected to increase as more objectives are optimized simultaneously. All methods discussed thus far have relied on introducing realism into the predictions by enumerating a hypothetical space of materials based on feasible building blocks. An alternative promising approach is using generative machine learning models to learn the distribution of known materials (e.g., from a database of experimental structures) and predict new hypothetical materials representing this distribution. Such an approach has been developed for bulk inorganic
materials634 and porous materials such as zeolites635 or
metal−organic frameworks636 but not yet extended to transition-metal complexes.
5.3. Automated and Autonomous High-throughput Workflows
In large part, the QSPR (section 4.2) and ML models (section 4.4) as well as advances in property optimization (section 5.2) have depended heavily on new strategies to share and access large data sets. In comparison to open-shell transition-metal chemistry that is the focus of this review, high-throughput screening workflows and strategies are considerably more mature in crystalline, solid-state materials as well as in smallmolecule organic chemistry. Although distinct challenges are apparent for bulk periodic materials in how they are characterized or screened, some parallels are evident in the need to screen large chemical spaces for both the solid-state and transition-metal complexes. Representative reviews of how high-throughput screening, large databases, and machine learning have advanced solid-state materials design or in organic reaction discovery are provided in refs 390, 637, and 638 and ref 639, respectively.
5.3.1. Computational High-throughput Screening and Exploration. A number of toolkits are available for the automation of high-throughput DFT calculations for discovery and ML model generation. Some general-purpose tools are available that are most frequently used for the screening of solid-state materials. For example, the atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a python toolkit that enables unit cell generation and interfaces to a wide number of codes, especially those that carry out periodic DFT and the analysis or control
of those calculations.640,641 The AFLOW642 code software framework and web interface are even more tailored for the solid state, streamlining high-throughput calculation of crystalline alloys, including through permutations of exper
imental structures.643 The pymatgen python library644 was designed to perform initial calculation setup and structure generation for solid-state materials as well as for the postprocessing analysis of materials properties from raw data.
The FireWorks645 and AiiDA646 codes are designed to optimize the procedure of automating and distributing calculation workflows as well as ensuring the provenance and reproducibility of calculations, also with a focus on solid-state DFT. While not originally tailored necessarily for DFT calculations, a number of cheminformatics toolkits are available for

studying small organic molecules. Small-molecule organic
chemistry codes such as RDkit and OpenBabel647 are widely used for high-throughput screening in organic chemistry. These tools carry out 3D structure generation from stringbased molecule identifiers such as the simplified molecular
input line entry system (SMILES)648 and have integrated force field (e.g., with MMFF94 or UFF) optimization. These codes are also useful for computing molecular fingerprints and using them to quantify molecular similarity (e.g., using the Tanimoto coefficient). Both codes have interfaces to large databases of
organic molecules (e.g., ChEMBL649). Motivated by the distinct challenges in describing and modeling metal−organic bonding, tailored toolkits have also been developed for transition-metal complexes. One early example developed by Hay et al. was the HostDesigner code
that automated construction of candidate metal ion hosts.650 The FORTRAN code modules (i.e., LINKER and OVERLAY) were used to construct macrocycles from a fragment library in which terminal hydrogen atoms were replaced with adjacent fragments. These components were force field optimized with MM3 to generate candidate chelators of metals that were scored by the proximity of the metal-coordinating sites to the
optimal position for a metal center.650
The molSimplify code53 was developed to enable divideand-conquer structure generation especially for high-throughput screening of open-shell transition-metal complexes. The code enables commandline generation of a range of transitionmetal complex symmetries with ligands built from SMILES strings, large molecular databases, or a built-in dictionary of common organic ligands for inorganic complexes that users
can update (Figure 69).53 The code uses OpenBabel as a backend to force field preoptimize the individual ligands and then molSimplify attaches them to points around a metal center with rotations and translations to minimize steric clashes (Figure 69). The initial, spin-state-dependent metal− ligand bond lengths selected for structure generation were derived from a database of DFT values and later updated to be
obtained from an ANN trained to predict54,527 metal−ligand bond lengths (Figure 69). This ANN improves upon general (i.e., UFF) force field bond length predictions by an order of
magnitude (Figure 2).34 The molSimplify code also interfaces to ChEMBL via OpenBabel for ligand selection. These tools have been used to carry out both pattern matching (i.e., with SMARTS) and diversity-oriented screens of organic molecules
(e.g., for transition-metal complex52 or inorganic molecule
generation438). A custom core and decorator module can be used to start from a prebuilt complex structure and then replace or modify aspects of the structure with functional
groups.53 The molSimplify code also generates input files and scripts for automating electronic structure calculations on generated individual and supramolecular complexes. Foscato et al. developed methods to fragment existing transition-metal complexes and reassemble them to make new
complexes50 (Figure 70). Fragments were most readily derived from structures obtained from the CSD or PubChem. Cutting rules were developed based on pattern matches (i.e., with SMARTS) to identify where complexes should be frag
mented.50 Attachment points were then defined and used for the reassembly of new transition-metal complexes from
available building blocks (Figure 70).50 First demonstrated
for building 2D structures,50 these methods were generalized through a series of fragment rotations to generate 3D
structures of acceptable quality.51 This approach was further
extended to include operations that closed rings to form
ligands of increased denticity from fragments,600 generalizing beyond fragments available in the CSD. In a similar fashion, the MOLASSEMBLER code is a tool that was developed to build molecular graphs and then identify stereocenters and conformational permutations during automated 3D structure
generation for both organic and inorganic molecules.651 Other codes have been specifically designed to focus on
catalyst screening. The AARON code652 focuses on computational prediction of the stereoselectivity of catalysts. AARON is applicable to reactions with well-established mechanisms but multiple possible stereocontrolling transition states to enable systematic screening and optimization of catalysts with
quantum chemical calculations (Figure 71).652 AARON relies on the existence of a good template library of prior catalysts and ligands to build catalyst structures but can detect rotatable bonds for conformer searching and transition-state generation, and it automates a series of DFT calculations needed to
evaluate catalysts652 (Figure 71). These tools have been primarily demonstrated on widely studied Pd- and Rh
containing catalysts.652,653 Like AARON, the CatVS code uses a user-defined complex and substrate and screens a library
of candidate ligands.654 CatVS differs from AARON in that it employs force fields (i.e., TSFF and MM3, see section 2) to
accelerate catalyst screening.654 Notably, the CatVS program was recently used to make computational predictions of highly enantioselective rhodium hydrogenation catalysis that were then verified experimentally to display the predicted
behavior.654 The autodE code655 was developed to overcome some challenges in structure generation for transition-metal

catalysts by fully automating catalytic intermediate structure
generation from input SMILES strings.655 The graphs of the reactants and products are used to generate guess transition states, which are refined with electronic structure calcu
lations.655 Given the high computational cost of carrying out explicit DFT calculations on a large number of complexes in a screening context, toolkits have also been developed for
evolutionary optimization55,656 (see section 5.2.1). The molSimplify automatic design (mAD) module is an extension to molSimplify that carries out evolutionary (i.e., single and multiobjective genetic algorithms) optimization of transitionmetal complexes represented as a series of genes. The fitness function can be evaluated directly from DFT calculations (i.e., with automated generation of input and queue script files for running electronic structure calculations) or by one of molSimplify’s artificial neural networks (e.g., for spin-splitting
prediction54,527), and the set of genes is evolved to best satisfy
the design objectives55 (Figure 72).
Jensen and co-workers developed the DENOPTIM code656 to enable evolutionary-algorithm-based design of transitionmetal complexes from fragments, building upon several other
earlier tools (e.g., the fragment explorer50) with wrapper codes (Figure 73). DENOPTIM represents the molecule as a
graph,656 and the code analyzes fragments in the molecule by comparison to available databases (e.g., ChEMBL and the CSD). Mutations to the fragments of the complex are carried out through a series of routines that ensure synthetic accessibility while optimizing for the user-provided fitness
function (Figure 73).656 Because the fitness function is a userprovided external call in a BASH script, DENOPTIM
supports656 force field, ML model, or DFT calculations for the fitness evaluation if the user has these available for the problem at hand (Figure 73). The globally optimal catalyst (GOCAT) framework is another toolkit that has been developed to optimize an abstraction of the catalyst environ
ment (i.e., the electric field) with low-cost semiempirical theory and to use genetic algorithms to identify discrete
candidates that best match the optimal field.657 Further development is needed (i.e., including in low-cost molecular modeling) to demonstrate this approach for open-shell transition-metal catalyst design.
5.3.2. Autonomous and ML-accelerated Computational Chemistry. The interface of data science tools with traditional modeling was described briefly in section 2.5. We expand upon that section to discuss how artificial intelligence has begun to be employed in a way that can guide and accelerate the high-throughput screening workflows described in section 5.3.1 for transition-metal chemistry. For transition-metal complex and catalyst screening, a unique challenge is the high rate of failure of calculations carried out with semiempirical methods and DFT (see section 2.5) that can be difficult to predict a priori. At the same time, the large size and associated high computational cost of calculations of transition-metal complexes relative to small organic molecules further highlights the importance of only initiating calculations that are likely to be successful. To automate and inform such a procedure, Duan et al. first
defined55 a series of geometric health metrics to determine when transition-metal complex geometry optimizations resulted in distortion of ligands or loss of ligand bonding to the metal. They also employed heuristic cutoffs for deviations of ⟨S2⟩ from its expected value of S(S + 1) and lower than expected localization of the spin to the metal (e.g., from
Mulliken spin analysis).55 To address the challenges of
calculation failure, Duan et al. trained519 ANN classifiers to accurately (ca. 88−95%) predict the likelihood of calculation
failures using graph-based RAC descriptors.498,500,501 Because
calculations take longer to fail than to succeed,519 they showed that these models both avoid generating spurious data for property prediction models and explore most (ca. 88%) of the
feasible chemical space in 33% of the computational time.519

Because the models employed graph-based descriptors, they required no prior calculation to predict calculation success, but their accuracy dropped rapidly on materials (e.g., high-valent metal-oxo catalysts) distinct from training data. Use of
uncertainty quantification527 improved performance on the smaller fraction of calculations for which the model was confident. Compositional descriptors have also demonstrated utility in training machine learning models to predict the computational cost of electronic structure calculations to guide
calculation selection.658
As a complementary approach, Duan et al.519 trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a set of 30 transferable descriptors of the electronic structure of the complex during the first 2−40 steps of a geometry optimization without including any explicit connectivity or chemical information. This information typically corresponded to
around the first 6 h of GPU-accelerated calculation time
(e.g., with TeraChem659) and no more than one-third of the
total average time.519 Given the strong path dependence of
calculation outcomes, analysis of the CNN model’s focus519
with gradient-weighted class-activation mapping660 revealed that some calculations took a significant number of steps before the model could determine if failure would occur. An
extension661 was incorporated into workflows for active
learning563 of methane-to-methanol catalysts457 in order to reduce calculation attrition rates in catalyst discovery (Figure 74). This extended dynamic multitask network model predicted three measures of calculation health (i.e., metal spin, deviations of ⟨S2⟩ from expected values, and geometry optimization outcome) based solely on properties of the wave function and the energetic gradient, representing an artificial intelligence model that avoided unfruitful calculations during active learning with limited prior training data (Figure 74). In addition to sensitivity analysis and Bayesian techniques for uncertainty quantification in DFT as described in section 2.5, Bayesian optimization has recently been proposed as a tool
to optimize DFT functional forms.662 To increase the domain
of applicability of functionals, Mitrofanov et al. proposed662 an automated approach to functional fitting against a data set by stochastic subsampling and iterative improvement of the functional coefficients with the tree-structured Parzen estimator. This is the same algorithm widely employed in ML architecture selection (e.g., HyperOpt). The automatically selected functionals were observed to outperform functionals developed with expert knowledge but also could fail when

suitable benchmark data was insufficient to guide coefficient
selection.662 As an alternative strategy to address the challenge of
balancing cost and accuracy, McAnanama-Brereton et al.663 demonstrated a proof-of-concept application of game theory to the selection of the appropriate density functional and basis set for studying a new molecule. Within game theory, the optimal choice for all players is selected in a so-called Nash equilibrium, and the goal of method selection was to balance expected performance, similarity to known data, and
calculation cost. Using the Decider interface,663 the Tanimoto similarity of an input molecule to benchmark organic molecules with known basis set/functional performance is calculated (Figure 75). Using this information, the optimal basis set and functional are chosen to balance performance and
complexity (i.e., computational cost, Figure 75).663 While not yet developed for strongly correlated systems or beyond a limited range of DFT functionals, such an approach could be highly beneficial in the screening of transition-metal complexes. A particularly relevant issue for transition-metal complexes is that the presence of strong multireference (MR) character could call into question results from a high-throughput screen
or ML-accelerated exploration. Liu et al.538 developed ML models to predict diagnostics of multireference (MR) character at low cost, enabling rapid assessment of strong
correlation.538 Using these models, they visualized regions of an enumerated space containing complexes with relatively lowor high-MR character and identified that traditional measures such as the HOMO−LUMO gap provide an incomplete
picture of what gives rise to MR character538 (Figure 50). These models can be used alongside chemical discovery algorithms to avoid regions where low-cost methods cannot be trusted.

Although a number of MR diagnostics have been
proposed218−231 in combination with heuristic cutoffs664 (see section 2.5), their application in high-throughput screening has nevertheless been limited. Because the diagnostics have a range of relative cost and reliability, it can be challenging to know beforehand which diagnostics are most suitable for a class of compounds to be screened. Sprague et al. proposed a
classification analysis665 to define MR effect as having a large error on predicted bond dissociation energies. They determined that most diagnostics and cutoffs produced more false positives than negatives, with %TAE(T) providing the best performance, in part due to the close relationship between
the diagnostic form and the predicted quantity665 (Figure 76). Comparison of diagnostic pairs (e.g., geometric mean, minimum, or maximum) showed that no combination
improved upon the single best-performing diagnostic,665
despite suggestions by Wilson and co-workers232,233 that a combination of WFT-based diagnostics with adjusted thresholds was useful in predicting MR character in transition-metal complexes. Most studies to date on MR character have necessarily been
limited to small molecules. Duan et al. confirmed509 over a large data set of small organic molecules in equilibrium and
distorted structures587 that established diagnostics disagree. Using the recovery of the correlation energy as a figure of merit
for diagnostic performance, they showed509 that lower-cost diagnostics from DFT were outperformed by higher-cost diagnostics obtained directly from MR WFT (e.g., the leading
weight of the CASSCF wave function218−221) that would be intractable in a high-throughput screening context. They developed ML models to overcome these limitations first by building regression models on size-independent, structure
dependent509 descriptors (see section 4.4.1) in combination with the low-cost, DFT-level diagnostics to predict high-cost, WFT-based diagnostics. To address the disagreement of multiple WFT-based diagnostics in combination with heuristic cutoffs, Duan et
al.565 used virtual adversarial training (VAT) to train an ANN classifier of MR character. In this semisupervised learning approach, an ANN was trained with a modified loss function that contained both a supervised and an unsupervised term, starting with labels only for the most extreme points where all diagnostics agreed. Because VAT models are robust to noisy inputs (e.g., in image classification), the ML-model-predicted WFT-based MR diagnostics could be used as inputs to the

VAT model, reducing the overall cost of MR classification to that of DFT in a manner that robustly distinguished SR from MR molecules at a level of accuracy that surpassed the conventional cutoff-based approach.565 Such methods can be used in large-scale chemical space exploration to determine where DFT is reliable and adapt to automated MR WFT where it is not. Within correlated wave function theory, ML models have been developed to predict the correlation energy,522,523 accelerate solution of the correlation energy,666 or make corrections on top of lower-level theories or in transfer learning models.236,667 A number of representations have been developed for this and related approaches, including transferable orbital-derived densities522,523 and energies/matrix elements,666 in addition to standard 2D and 3D ML representations. With few preliminary demonstrations on transition-metal complexes,523 such techniques have largely been applied to closed-shell singlet organic molecules with unambiguous ground-states at their equilibrium structures. Automated, statistical209 and ML-informed211 methods for active space selection discussed in section 2.5 likely require further advances to enable their application in high-throughput screening in transition-metal chemistry. For example, a preliminary demonstration has shown that artificial neural networks can accelerate convergence of selected configuration interaction on small molecules by selecting the most essential
configurations.668 For mechanism discovery, automated and semiautonomous tools to identify the most important reaction mechanisms have been proposed to minimize computational cost or expert intervention. The artificial force-induced reaction (AFIR) of Morokuma and co-workers enables the automated identification of approximate local minima and transition states, including for reactions catalyzed by transition-metal com
plexes.669 Bergeler et al. proposed670 a computational protocol for generation of candidate reactive transition-metal complexes from heuristic rules derived from conceptual DFT. By adding reactive protons, they analyze changes to the catalyst electronic structure to identify candidate reactive intermediates. They retain only those below an energy cutoff, and finally they refine transformations of similar intermediates with path-based
transition-state search (Figure 77).670 This approach remains
too computationally demanding to apply in combination with computational catalyst design. Other researchers have developed fully automated workflows
that leverage accelerated high-temperature ab initio671,672 (e.g.,
Hartree−Fock) or semiempirical673 molecular dynamics as
well as enhanced sampling674 (e.g., metadynamics) for mechanism discovery primarily in small organic molecules.
The nanoreactor671,672 and tsscds2018673 tools automate the normally challenging task of identifying reactive events by
using heuristics to detect bond rearrangement672,673 and then postprocess these structures as starting points for automated transition-state searches. Caveats remain in the application of these semiempirical or low-cost ab initio methods in transitionmetal chemistry, where intermediates and transition states could be missed by lower-accuracy methods (see section 2). ML models have also been demonstrated to reduce the number of explicit calculations required during time-consuming geometry optimization and transition-state search in mechanism discovery. These techniques include using surrogate models (e.g., Gaussian processes or ANNs) to
estimate the local potential energy surface,675−680 to reduce the
time to self-consistent energy evaluation,681 or to estimate when a candidate mechanistic step in a reaction network will be too high in energy to contribute to a reaction
mechanism.682,683
5.3.3. Machine Learning Toolkits. The majority of tools used in machine learning model training are general purpose in nature and developed by the computer science community. Given the fast-changing nature of the field, we only briefly mention some of these tools and their purpose. We also briefly mention some tailored tools useful for property prediction in chemistry and materials science. ML model training is most frequently carried out with scikit-learn or for more intensive models (e.g., neural networks) with Keras (i.e., as a front end to TensorFlow) or PyTorch. Hyperparameter selection in ML model training, including selection of model architectures for neural networks, is too computationally demanding for exhaustive search. As a result, Bayesian optimization has been demonstrated as an approach to identify optimal
architectures, e.g., in Hyperopt684 and GPtune685 toolkits.
Recently, the COMBO toolkit686 was developed specifically for materials science applications and includes Bayesian optimization with Thompson sampling both for the optimization of

hyperparameters in neural networks as well as specifically for optimization of materials objectives. In materials science,
frameworks for data mining from external databases687 and automatic ML model building with a diverse set of ad hoc
attributes have also been demonstrated.688,689 Within the chemical sciences, efforts have been made to make ML, data visualization, and feature selection more userfriendly. Examples of these efforts include the automated training and optimization of ML models. An early example is the DeepChem open-source project, including the Molecule
Net690 data set of benchmarks and model training wrappers for organic chemistry. More recent developments include the application of chemistry-specific featurizations with the
ML4Chem691 toolkit. The ChemML692 toolkit specializes in providing a high-level wrapper for automated ML model training and visualization. Within the QSPR/QSAR community, automated tools have been developed for some
time.693−695 Special attention here has been paid to whether pharma-relevant quantities are reproducibly predicted by
models (e.g., in AMPL694) or automated feature selection
and to estimate the “learnability” of a data set.693 None of these tools have been tailored for open-shell transition-metal chemistry to date, in part due to the smaller data sets and few available benchmarks.
5.3.4. Data Extraction and Automation of Experiments. This review has focused on accelerated discovery of transition-metal complexes with high-throughput screening and machine learning from a computational perspective. Here, we briefly review synergistic efforts in extraction from the literature and autonomous experimentation that could inform computationally driven efforts. For discussion beyond the scope of this review, readers are encouraged to consider the more detailed reviews of refs 696−699. In comparison to the outstanding challenges for autonomous computational chemistry, self-driving laboratory demonstrations have matured
substantially over the past 30 years.696 Advances include integration of AI with robotics and flow synthesis to enable
autonomous organic molecule synthesis.700−704 Both neural networks for reaction outcome prediction from literature
data705,706 and reinforcement learning with microdroplet
reactions for experimental design and mechanism discovery707
along with improvements in online characterization702,704,708 have enabled the retrosynthetic advances necessary for this autonomous experimentation (Figure 78). While somewhat less mature, robotics and AI have also been demonstrated in the synthesis and characterization of materials, such as
quantum dots.709 In a related, manual approach, recommendations from an ANN have been scored by experimentalists to
guide synthesis of organic light-emitting diodes.710 Machine learning in the form of natural language processing
(NLP) has extended385,711,712 text-mining tools to enable extraction of information about materials properties and synthesis from the literature, as recently reviewed in ref 713. Although examples have been demonstrated for extraction of
uniformly reported properties (e.g., surface area of a MOF386), natural language processing has been demonstrated to be essential to capture complexities in sentence structures (Figure
79). Toolkits such as chemdataextractor712 aim to tailor NLP to common chemical phrases and properties (Figure 79). Extraction of synthesis recipes has generated sufficiently large data sets on a range of solid-state materials (e.g., metal
oxides385 or zeolites714) to enable prediction of which conditions improve synthesis outcomes. These large data sets
have enabled unsupervised (e.g., variational autoencoder) methods to develop representations of influences on syn
thesis,711,715 semisupervised models where only a fraction of
synthesis outcomes are labeled,574 as well as regression models where more chemically informed descriptors of materials
properties are known.714 Still, limitations in extending NLP extraction efforts to transition-metal complexes and metal−organic materials property predictions remain. This is largely due to data sparsity or lack of uniformity in the reporting of properties (e.g., in the supporting information versus main text) as well as publication and experimentation bias toward successful
results.716−719 Nevertheless, such data should significantly augment currently available experimental data sets in transition-metal chemistry that are either small or consist only of X-ray diffraction structures (see section 4.1).
6. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
In recent years, machine learning has emerged as an essential complement to traditional physics-based models and experiments. The advances in this area have presented unique opportunities and challenges in transition-metal chemistry due to the diversity of chemical bonding possible in a transitionmetal complex as well as the interplay between spin, oxidation state, and metal electron configuration. This review has covered how machine-learning-accelerated discovery in this space has benefitted from key advances in automation, ligand chemistry, experimental data sets, and physics-based modeling.

These advances have enabled improvement upon best-in-class experimental catalysts and materials. The development of uncertainty-aware search with surrogate ANN models of large spaces has led to identification of compounds with optimal properties and revealed new design principles. Further improvements have come with the automation and acceleration of computational modeling techniques. Despite this progress, several outstanding challenges in the field remain for fully autonomous machine-learning-accelerated transition-metal chemical discovery to be realized. We will briefly outline some of these now. A practical approach to systematically improve electronic structure method accuracy is not as well established for transition-metal chemistry as it is for organic chemistry. While automated or rule-based active space selection methods have demonstrated some promise, they often suggest active spaces that are beyond reach of high-throughput screening workflows. Furthermore, the cost−accuracy trade-off is not well established here. There is a need still for development of low-cost methods that can robustly predict properties of openshell transition-metal complexes, and when such a method (e.g., MM, SQM, or DFT) will perform well or fail needs to be more broadly understood in transition-metal chemistry for these choices to be easily incorporated into automated workflows. Similarly, robust benchmarks from experiment or those that eliminate uncertainty in the identity of the reacting species are an outstanding challenge in transition-metal chemistry. Extraction of larger, robust data sets will benefit benchmarking of both physics-based and data-driven models. Transferability remains an open challenge for machinelearned representations and models. This refers both to generalization to new regions of chemical space and to better prediction from smaller data sets. For transition-metal
chemistry, the balance between near- and far-sighted properties has been established to be distinct from organic chemistry. This distinction can be encoded in learned representations or in feature-selected representations. Just as force fields are often developed for a single or small range of metals, present machine learning models often only attempt to generalize to a small portion of the periodic table. Building models that truly generalize between rows of metals or across different ligand types is essential. Furthermore, interpreting the appropriate feature or latent space that accurately describes similarity of isovalent species will be essential for developing new approaches to design in transition-metal chemical space. A perhaps even greater question only starting to be addressed is the extent to which machine learning models should simultaneously capture multiple Born−Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces. Should such models learn not just the ground state but also when the ground state changes and in what manner, either for photoexcited species or multiple lowlying spin states? A combinatorial challenge for data generation and chemical space exploration also remains. While enumerative strategies have been exploited for early successes in machine learning for subsets of small-molecule organic chemistry, the path to enumeration in transition-metal chemical space is less clear. Furthermore, it is not obvious to what extent chemical space should be explored in neighborhoods around known hits versus through larger variations in chemistry to overcome the multiple constraints in most practical materials design. While not the focus of this review, the twin challenge of materials discovery is mechanism discovery, especially in catalysis. Often, one must be simplified to address the other in screening, but at present there are no systematic approaches to identifying when changing the material changes the mechanism or how to

design a catalyst or material with the intent of improving its stability. Despite some of these limitations, machine-learningaccelerated discovery of transition-metal complexes is showing rapid progress across a range of applications. The inherently challenging to describe quantum mechanical nature of openshell metal centers has particularly benefitted from nonlinear machine learning models in their accelerated discovery. It is expected the next few years will bring ever more changes to the way we think about carrying out materials and molecular discovery on a computer, especially in these challenging materials spaces.
