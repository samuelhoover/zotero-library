INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION)

THIS

REMARKABLE

BOOK was translated by me about

fifteen

years ago because I felt keenly that Oparin's

con-

tribution

had such great importance

for scientists

and

non-scientists alike that it should be available to all Eng-

lish-reading

people. It is a tribute to its true merits that

the book should be reprinted after a lapse of so many

years, and I gladly yield to the request of the publishers

to write a preface

for this edition.

If I were to change

the name of this book, I would

suggest

\"LIFE'S

instead

To be-

conceals

two significant

misconcep-

tions. One concerns

the duration of the process. \"Origin,\"

out with a profusion of plant and animal spe-

cies of almost endless variety,

has occupied

a period of

something like a billion years. The Earth has retained

an unmistakable record of this for nearly half a billion

years. It will aid the reader to orient himself with regard

to the evolution

of species, to be reminded that in this

inconceivably

long span of half.a-billion years, registered

in the Earth's crust by some historical remains, the foot-

marks left by man and his close predecessors

encompass

barely one million years, perhaps two-tenths

of one per-

cent.

the But

origination

of life, which is the subject matter

of Oparin's

book, precedes by about another billion

years

the story of the \"Origin of Species\"

in which Darwin

picks up the thread,

and of this earlier period there is

no existing record. While Darwin's is a well documented

story and his ideas, though highly controversial,

can be

bolstered with substantial factual material, Oparin's story

embracing

probably

another billion years lacks the sup-

port of ascertainable

facts. By its very nature,

a theory

of how life had come into being must be highly specu-

lative. Lacking

a solid factual basis, the soundness or

acceptability

of such a theory can only be judged

by

whether or not, or to what extent, it conforms to the cri-

terion

of reasonable

consistency with established knowl-

edge in various fields of scientific

inquiry.

The origin of

life was not an occurrence

to some definite

place and time; it was a gradual process

process

of unfolding

which consumed perhaps more mil-

lions of years than was required for the evolution

of all

the species of living things.

It is one of Oparin's great

contributions

to the theory of the origin of life that he

postulated a long chemical evolution

as a necessary pre-

amble to the emergence

of Life. One might think of the

evolutionary

process passing through three distinct

chem-

ical phases, from inorganic chemistry to organic

chem-

istry and from organic chemistry And it is true that, if the organic

to biological

chemistry.

chemist is familiar with

wonders

undreamed

of by the inorganic chemist, the won..

ders witnessed by the biochemist in his daily tasks stagger

the imagination

and sharpen the envy of the organic chem-

ist. These transitions

in the history of our Earth were

not isolated

events but a continuous flux

for their realization. In interpreting the word \"origin\" one must free

the oneself

requiring

eons

significance

of

of the cultural

tradition and conceive

it as something entirely outside the

ordinary human

framework

of time.

The second misconception stems from associations

clus-

tering about the word \"Life.\" To most people Life con-

notes

something

that crawls, creeps or at least wiggles

if not by means of well articulated appendages

at any rate

by temporary protoplasmic protrusions,

or cilia, or deli-

cate flagella. Life need not perhaps

But even the most

Vl11)

INTRODUCTION)

unicellular

organism has a complexity of structure

and

function that staggers the mind and is removed from the

beginnings of Life by a genealogy extending for millions

upon

millions

of years. Possibly, as Oparin so convinc-

ingly tells us, it all began some a venture in colloidal systems arating from the \"hot thin soup,\"

two billion years ago as

of microscopic

size sep-

to use Haldane's happy

description

of the primordial

ocean.

The biologist, unlike the layman,

knows no lines of

demarcation separating plant life from animal life, nor

for that matter

living from non-living material, because

such differentiations

are purely

conceptual

and do not

correspond

to reality.

It is interesting to consider the influence

which the

identification of life with cellular organisms

exerted

on

the theory of spontaneous generation.

and

now classical experiments of Pasteur

on such primitive

living matter can be transformed into living matter; in other words, whether biogenesis is possible. But Pasteur's

unequivocal

experiments

have given no answer to this

basic

problem.

They merely furnished irrefutable proof

that

living

organisms,

no matter how simple they might

be, cannot be generated from organic matter. Yet, some-

times in the course of evolution of our planet inorganic and organic matter must have beconle endowed with or-

ganization which

after hundreds

of millions of years en-

abled it to develop into organisms. These in turn, after

many more hundreds of millions of years,

have spread

over the surface of the planet populating

the soil, water

and air with an infinite variety of plant and animal forms.

It may never be possible to devise experiments

to prove

or disprove the possibility of biogenesis,

and even Pas-

teur's experiments do not disprove

seems to be a reasonably

consistent

this, but biogenesis logical necessity.

It is more

pertinent

to inquire, if such a transforma-

tion of lifeless

into living matter occurred once

upon

a

time, whether this is happening at all times.

\"There

is

no scientific basis,\" says Kavanau,

\"that life may not be

originating continuously

upon the earth. The fact that we

have no evidence of such de novo origin is of no particu-

lar significance, for if there is such origin we must an-

ticipate

that it would be in units far too small to be treated

in the manner in which

we are accustomed

to dealing

with orp;anisms.

The conditions

on the Earth during the past couple

of billion years have undergone

such radical

alterations

that biogenesis may no longer be possible. However, as

Oparin points

out, even if biogenesis were operating at

the

present

time, the innumerable predatory organisms

which

populate

the Earth would quickly destroy the prod-

ucts of biogenesis.

It will in no measure

detract from Oparin's credit for

this brilliant idea to point out that no less illustrious a

biologist

than Charles Darwin himself expressed a sim-

ilar thought

in a letter he wrote in 1871 (for the un-

covering of this letter we are indebted to G. Hardin) :)

\"It is often said that all the conditions

for the

first production of a living organism are now present,

which

could ever have been present. But if (and oh!

what a big if) we could

conceive

in some warm

little pond,

with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric

salts, light, heat, electricity, etc., present, that a

protein compound was chen1ically formed ready to

undergo

still more complex changes, at the present

day, such matter would be instantly devoured

or

absorbed,

which would not have been the case before

living creatures were formed.\)

The origination

of life was a transition from organic

to biological

chemistry, from lifeless to living

matter,

from the inanimate to the animate

realm of Nature. But

what is Life? Is it some new property

acquired in the course

of evolution

which resulted from the organization

of organic matter or is it something of organic matter?

Irritability, motility, aids to differentiate

growth,

reproduction

may be good

a live from a dead organism but it is

questionable

whether these represent the fundamental

properties

of primordial life. There is good reason

to

think that a certain period

of the Earth's history must

have been

marked

by complete sterility, i.e. absence of

organisms;

therefore,

the fundamental property or prop-

erties

of living systems must have appeared

in highly

complex protein macromolecules antedating the appear-

ance of cellular organisms. Proteins containing

nucleic

acid are the only constituents of organisms

which are

known to possess the capacity

to grow and to reproduce

directly by self-duplication

or by replication. But as or-

ganic

compounds

they can neither grow nor reproduce.

Neither

viruses nor genes, both of which represent

nucleo-

protein

systems, can duplicate or replicate

themselves

unless they are incorporated within a suitable

cell or

nucleus. Considered simply from the point of view of

capacity to reproduce,

are these nucleoproteins

living or

non-living systems?

and we are

(Time's Arrow and Evolu-

tion, 1951) for his masterly

analysis of this extremely

important

aspect

of this subject.

One should add, as a fundamental

property

of living

systems, a characteristic of their metabolism

to form only

one of the two optically active antipodes (i.e. either the

or

the

L form

but never both,

as is the case in organic synthesis). It is not clear how

this remarkable

characteristic of living systems had arisen

or whether

it contributed

to the transformation of non-

living to living n\037atter.

Almost

a hundred

years ago Engel propounded

the

thesis that life is a manifestation of the existence

of pro-

teins, but he did not know that in reality life is a man-

ifestation

of catalysis

by means of enzymes which

are

proteins.

Chemical reactions in plant and animal orga-

nisms

proceed

at very high velocities. Without

cataly-sis

there could be no life. In fact, the bulk of protoplasm is

have evolved from these inorganic catalysts and thereby

the tempo of biochemical reactions has been stepped

up

a thousand or even a million fold. The unfolding

of the

tremendous diversity of living organisms

within the last

half-a-billion years, as compared

to the relatively

very

slow evolution of the preceding

billion years may have

resulted

from the association of the primitive metal cata-

lysts with proteins.

But we know that the protein

cata-

lysts (enzymes) had already been operating

at the very

dawn of the appearance

of plant and animal life. Al-

though enzyme

systems

have been highly diversified in the

course

of evolution,

their basic pattern has persisted

through

the geologic ages. It might almost be asserted

that the earliest organisms had acquired the basic prin-

ciples of biochemical catalysis and no new principles

had been invented to replace them. Thus, the very lowly

Bryozoa are known

to have maintained

morphological

uni-

formity for hundreds

of millions of years. If we assume

that the Bryozoa have also maintained physiological

uni-

formity throughout

their inconceivably long life history,

it must be concluded that the enzymes

of heavy metal

electron transfer have been operating

in cellular respira-

tion ever since living

organisms

have inhabited the Earth.

Evolution has flowered

from the Bryozoa (and probably

long before

them) to the vertebrates, but the heavy

metal

electron

transfer

enzyme system has persisted

through

all these hundreds of millions of years as the basic de-

sign of cellular

respiration.)))

XIV)

INTRODUCTION)

Similarly,

if we consider the lowly

bread

mold (Neu-

rospora),

also of very

ancient

and venerable geologic

age, we witness

the persistence

over millions of years of

enzyme systems which, with some modifications,

are still

found operating in higher organisms,

including

man.

The coenzyme factors (the so-called

vitamin

B com-

plex) seem to be universally

distributed

and, what is

more significant, the chains of biochemical

reactions by

which each factor

is synthesized

appear to be the same

in most

divergent

organisms.

The biochemical unity sug-

gests that the coenzymes became part of a basic metabolic plan laid down even before evolution, acting through nat-

ural selection,

had created

a highly diversified flora and

fauna.

The only kG\037wn means

for storing, transforming

and

mobilizing energy

for the metabolism

in living organisms

is the

system

of high energy phosphate bond, namely

Adenylic

Acid;::=

Adenosinediphosphate

\037 Adenosine-

triphosphate. This system,

which

is chemically

related

to the nucleic acids, played

a paramount

role in the

transfer of free energy from the very beginning of life,

and undoubtedly

played a very critical role in the transi-

tion from the non-living

to the living state. The system

has thus

been

preserved

through the long geologic ages

apparently

unchanged.

Though this, too, is one of the

most essential endowments of life and, since non-living

became

living matter, it persisted in the organized

lar structure,

This line of reasoning

of what came first in the proces-

without

any

tangible gain in understanding because

this line of rea-

soning starts from a wrong premise. One becomes cap-

tive of a chain of arguments attempting to solve the para-

to the

existence of living systems, came into being before the

living systems existed, which

alone seem to possess the

As long as the cell is considered

as the unit of life,

the origin of life must remain a paradox. But like the

erstwhile

atom in chemistry, the cell has lost its prestige

as the ultimate unit in biology.

Both the atomic and the

cellular theories

have

become

obsolete. The cell, like

the \"indivisible\"

atom, is now recognized as a highly or-

ganized small
ticles

and integrated

system built up from

extremely

and distinct particles. Whether the ultimate

par-

of life have been found

and identified

is very

doubtful, some of the units themselves being highly or-

ganized

entities, but the concept of a cell as the unit of

life has been thrown out of the window together with the

atom.

has It

long

been

recognized

that a cell consists of two

main parts, the nucleus and cytoplasm.

The nucleus

is

further differentiated into a nucleolus and chromosomes,

the latter consisting

of tiny particles, the genes,

which)))

INTRODUCTION)

XVll)

are arranged

in fibrils

are and

propagated

by self-divi-

sion. These particles are composed

predominantly

of

nucleoproteins

extremely

rich in desoxyribonucleic

acid

(DNA).

This DNA is not only the unique

nuclear

con-

stituent but is most likely the genetic material.

The nucleus

is extremely poor in enzymes

and its only demonstrable

biochemical potentiality is the synthesis

of nucleic acids.

Removed from the cell, however,

the isolated nucleus rap-

idly loses its viability

and fails to function when it is

replaced

into an enucleated cell. Without the necessary

mechanisms

to furnish its energy requirements, it is com-

pletely

dependent

upon the cytoplasm, but it is not para-

sitic. In all probability it supplies the cytoplasm

with

ribonucleic

acid (RNA), and their interrelationship

should

be described as symbiotic. Speaking figuratively,

us isolated from the cytoplasm

has no future,

a nucle-
nor much

of a present

either.

Protoplasm is a highly complex

colloidal

system

of

such lability that it tends to break down spontaneously.

During life it is in a steady

dynamic

state, and energy

furnished by the metabolic

mechanism

is constantly re-

quired to maintain

its structure intact. But since metab-

olism is a regular sequence of chemical reactions

which

must occur at the right time and at the right place, the

protoplasm

must be a highly integrated system of en-

zymes whose activity is strictly controlled (by alternate

activation

and inactivation). Any disturbance in the en-

zyme pattern will tend to destroy

the orderly

structure

of)))

INTRODUCTION)

the protoplasm;

any alteration of the protoplasmic

ture will disturb the harmonious functioning

strucof the

enzymes.
The cytoplasm consists of several

types of particles

possessing varying degrees of complexity

such as mitochondria, microsomes,

Golgi

of organization, bodies, chloro-

plasts, etc. The mitochondria

are large liponucleoprotein

orga-

nelles occupying perhaps

a third of the cytoplasm. They

consist

of a complex of enzymes so completely inter-

digitated

as to constitute practically a single entity struc-

turally

and a regular power house functionally.

They

catalyze a great variety of reactions consisting

of aerobic

oxidations

(fatty acids, amino acids, tricarboxylic

cycle)

as well as oxidative phosphorylations and some syn-

theses.

However, separated from its nucleus,

the cytoplasm

has

no enduring future. It still displays

for a while various

functions (irritability, contractility,

respiration,

etc.) and

maintains itself with the energy

delivered

from its par-

ticulates, but deprived

of the companionship of its nucleus

beyond

a certain

time limit, its ability to grow,

repro-

duce, differentiate as well as synthesize specific

proteins

fails to materialize.

The life of the cell can thus be regarded as the resultant

the of

continuous

interaction

between nucleus and cyto-

plasm. But the interaction

is conditioned upon the fitness

between

them so that the interaction is in the nature of)))

a symbiosis.

It is significant that the nucleus

with its

inclusions (genes), which alone has no durable

present,

and the cytoplasm (with its various inclusions), which

alone has no enduring future, can by proper

juxtaposition

synthesize proteins for growth and reproduction

Furthermore,

the cell becomes a very efthe protein synthesis is

directed

toward highly specific proteins which imprint a

high

degree

of specificity upon the manifestations of life

in different organisms. And, it may be added

parentheti-

cally, provided it is not destroyed by some accident

or

extraneous influence, that the cell acquires

a future and

that future

is infinity.

A few random examples of biological

symbiosis

may

serve to emphasize the profound

significance

of this phe-

nomenon as the pattern

which might have been operative

not only at the cellular or particulate level but even at

the macromolecular

in level

the transformation

of non-

living to living matter.

Hemoglobin,

the red blood pigment, has been usually

regarded

as a strictly animal product.

In recent years

it was discovered that hemoglobin

is formed in the root

nodules of legumes

harboring

nitrogen fixing bacteria.

The far-reaching

significance

of this biological observa-

tion lies in the fact that neither the root nodules nor the

microorganisms,

by themselves,

are capable of effecting)))

xx)

INTRODUCTION)

this synthesis.

Only

the in

infected

nodule

is hemoglobin

being synthesized. Two entirely different

living

systems

enter a symbiotic partnership and out of this interrela-

tionship something new emerges, the synthesis

of a com-

plex substance, which

neither

system alone could fulfill.

It is true that in this instance the creative situation ter-

minates

in a biochemical blind alley (and the course of

evolution is full of blind alleys) but instead

of bringing

forth a \"freak\"

of nature this event could conceivably

have

opened

a new biological era.

Another pertinent

story can be told about chlorophyll,

a green

pigment

closely related chemically to hemoglobin.

This pigment

is found in plants in special organelles, the

chloroplasts.

Chlorophyll

absorbs light waves in the pur-

ple

and

red

range

the of

spectrum

and thus traps radiant

energy. This gives the plant cell containing chloroplasts

a source of free energy to perform anabolic processes

which

cells lacking

this mechanism are unable to accom-

plish. It is interesting to note that chlorophyll

itself is

unable to accomplish

the photosynthetic

reaction except

as a component of a chloroplast.

Chloroplasts

are small

green bodies

enclosed

in the cytoplasm of higher plants

and of green algae. The reaction sequence

of photosyn-

thesis begins and ends within

the chloroplast.

Isolated

from the surrounding cytoplasm

the chloroplast

can evolve

oxygen from water when exposed

to light but it cannot

use carbon

dioxide

as oxidant in this reaction. Nor can the

isolated

( intact) chloroplast carry out photosynthesis,)))

INTRODUCTION)

XXI)

which

indicates

that this depends upon cooperation

with

the cytoplasm.

In other words, photosynthesis

which

is

one of the most important

means

for accumulating

free

energy available in nature has emerged

from a symbiotic

arrangement.

Neither participant in the partnership

is

capable of accomplishing this synthesis. Existing

sep-

arately and independently chlorophyll, chloroplast and

cytoplasm

may have remained at the level of organic

mat-

ter. The concatenation of all three (by chance or accident)

within the plant cell opened up new vistas of evolutionary

potentialities

by tapping

the inexhaustible

source of the

sun's energy and making it available for biological

prog-

ress.

A concluding word should be added

about viruses.

Both the virus and the gene represent

the simplest sub-

stances known

to be autoreproducible.

Both are largely or

entirely nucleoprotein

macromolecules.

Plant viruses con-

only tain

ribonucleic

acid

(RNA)

and animal viruses

contain both RNA and DNA, whereas genes contain

desoxyribonucleic

acid (DNA).

Nevertheless,

viruses and

genes have some things in common. Thus, neither can

reproduce

itself except within a suitable type of cell.

However,

if the genes (nucleus) and cytoplasm

fit each

other (i.e., belong to the same or closely related species)

their symbiotic

relationship

culminates

in normal develop-

ment; if the virus and host cell fit each other, the virus

usually multiplies and in doing sitic relationship). The discarded

AUTHOR'S FOREWORD

TO

THE

ENGLISH

EDITION)

FOR A LONG TIME I have been greatly intrigued by the

question

as to how life on Earth began

and for more than

fifteen years have been actively engaged in searching for

a solution

of the problem which has stirred me so deeply.

The fruits of the meditations and researches along these

lines have been presented in a series of scientific

articles

and popular

essays.

1923 I In

published

a booklet devoted

to this problem in which my views according to which life

appeared

in the gradual evolution of primary organic sub-

stances were first expounded. Subsequently I attempted to

develop

this idea further and to substantiate

it with data

derived from various investigations

carried

out by astron-

omers, geologists, biochemists

and others working in re-

lated fields.

The information

garnered from these various

sources

has been incorporated

in 1936 in my book,

\"The

Origin of Life,\" a translation of which is now offered to

the reader.

The

problem

of the beginning of life still intrigues

my

curiosity

and stirs my imagination, and I am therefore

greatly

beholden

to The Macmillan Company for under-

taking the publication of a translation which

will bring

large this book before the

CHAPTER I)

THEORIES

OF SPONTANEOUS

GENERATION

OF LIFE)

THE

QUESTION

OF THE ORIGIN OF LIFE, of its first appear-

ance on Earth, still occupies the human

mind, as it has

done since the most remote antiquity.

It may be safely

said most that it is one of the

important

problems

of natu-

ral history. No religious or philosophical

system,

no out-

standing thinker ever failed to give this question serious

consideration. During different

epochs

and at different

stages of civilization the question

was answered differ-

ently, but this question

was always the focal point of a

sharp philosophical

struggle

which reflected the under-

lying struggle

of social classes. For a very long time the

question

of the origin of life was treated not as a subject

of scientific research but entirely

from the point of view

of religio-scholastic

concepts. The ancient religious teach-

ings of China, Egypt, Babylon traced the origin of life to

various traditions and legends, and invariably attributed

the appearance

of life to some creative

act of God. But

we will not concern ourselves with these theories and shall

consider which,

only though

very cursorily those philosophical systems no longer of any significance so far as our

modern

approach

3)

It is easy to understand the tremendous

significance

of

such daily experience in the formulation

of conceptions

among the ancient peoples,

who lacked the methods for an

exact study of natural phenomena. Such \"irrefutable evi-

dence\" formed the basis of theories of many philosophers

of the Ionian school (600 B.C.) according

to which living

organisms originated in sea slime by the action of heat,

sun and air. Thus,

for instance,

the oldest philosopher of

this Greek

school, Thales 2, taught that living things

devel-

oped from the amorphous slime under the influence

of

heat. Anaximander

(611-547 B.C.) claimed that every-

thing living arises in sea ooze and goes through

a succes-

sion of stages in its development

8. Xenophane

(560--480

B.C.)

taught

all that

organisms

originate

from earth and

water 4.

It is necessary to point out, however,

that the concep-

tion of spontaneous generation

of living things, enter-

tained by Creek philosophers on the basis of everyday

observation, was intimately interwoven

with their teach-

the ing of

perpetuity

of life. Although they considered

the origin of life from lifeless inorganic matter, this

strictly

speaking

did not. imply a primary phenomenon,

these since in the view of

philosophers

the entire universe

was conceived to be Jiving. Thus, according to Anaxagorus

(510--428 B.C.), neither

creation

nor destruction

of life

was possible and, although and man all came from

in his opinion plants, animals the earth's slime, nevertheless it

was essential that this should be fructified by unchanging

and infinitely

small

seeds (spermata),

the ethereal em-

bryos,

which were carried into the earth from the air with

rain water G.)))

4)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

Similarly, Empedocles (490-444 B.C.) maintained

that

plants and animals were formed from live inorganic

sub-

stance either by a process

of generation

from similar

sources or by a process of self-promulgation

from dis-

similar sources. In the latter case the fructifying and life-

giving principles were the warmth

of the sun, earth and

of the rainfall

from the sky. Democritus, like Anaximan-

der, thought that the organic world took its origin in water

and that animals passed

through

a long developmental

process before they became

such as we find them today.

But this philosopher

already

advanced

the theory of the

mechanical self-creation

of life resulting from an inherent

movement

of the atoms: the atoms of lifeless, moist earth

meet accidentally

and unite with atoms

of the live and

energizing fire 6.

The views of Epicurus (341-270 B.C.) are likewise

very interesting

in this

connection

are and

expressed

in

the materialistic

poem of Lucretius \"On the Nature of

Things\". According to this source,

Epicurus

taught that

under the influence of the moist heat of the sun and rain

worms and innumerable other animals

arose from the

earth or manure. This, however,

is no more remarkable

than the hatching

of the chick from a lifeless egg, since

the Earth, which is the mother

of plants, animals and man

is already endowed

with the power of propagation. And,

furthermore,

like a real mother, she very nearly loses all

her pristine powers of propagation with advancing

age 7.

(384-322

B.C.) have

an entirely different future history of

his views had undergone

some modi-

fication in the course of time, but ultimately

he laid the

foundation

of the theory of spontaneous generation of liv-

ing things.

According to this theory from other similar animals

things do arise and

always have arisen from lifeless

that living things,

as well as other concrete things, are pro-

duced

by the union of some passive

(by which Aristotle apparently refers to what we now des-

ignate as substance)

with an active principle \"form\", this

form being the \"entelechy\" or soul of living things. It im-

Thus,

ter by itself is devoid

of life but is vivified, purposefully

and organized

by the aid of the energy of the soul,

whose inner essence (entelechy) endows

matter

with life

and keeps it alive. But the soul is already present in the-

primary

elements

lesser

degree

property

of the earth, but to a greater

degree

of water, air and fire. Therefore, what form the

soul will endow depends first of all on the predominance

of one or the other element. Thus, the earth produces prin-

cipally plants; water produces aquatic animals; air, terres-)))

zens of celestial

bodies, such as the Moon. The form of

living things originating from their like depends

upon the

\"animal heat\", but of those generated

spontaneously

from

inorganic

matter upon the \"sun's

heat\".

Slime, manure,

and similar decaying matter

do not of themselves produce

living organisms but only under the fructifying influence

of rain saturated with air and of the Sun's heat.

Aristotle suggested

the possibility

of spontaneous gen-

eration of a great variety of living organisms. He main-

tained that not only plants but also a number

of animals

could be observed to originate

from the earth. According

to Aristotle ordinary worms,

larvae

of the bee or wasp,

ticks,

fireflies

and many other insects develop from the

morning

dew, or from decaying slime and manure,

from

dry wood, hair, sweat and meat, while tapeworms

are born

in the rotting

portions

of the body and excreta. Mosqui-

toes, flies, moths, manure beetles, cantharides, also fleas,

bed bugs and lice (either full grown

or as larvae) are gen-

erated in the slime of wells, rivers or sea, in the humus of

the fields, in manure, in decaying

trees or fruits, in animal

excreta and filth of every sort, in vinegar dregs as well as

in old wool.

However, not only insects

and worms but even more

highly organized

living

creatures

may originate spontane-

ously according to Aristotle.

Crabs and various molluscs

were thought to come from the moist soil and decaying

slime, eels and many kinds of fish to come froln the wet

certain conditions

salamanders

may come from slime.

and even man may have a similar origin,

though

in the

case of the latter his first appearance

is in the form of a

worm.

We have dwelt to such length on the views of Aristotle

because the entire history of the problem

of the origin of

living things has been dominated

by the teachings of this

philosopher.

By his overwhelming

authority Aristotle gave

credence

to data derived from naive direct observation

and

thus predetermined

for many centuries in advance

the fu-

ture fate of the theory

of spontaneous

generation.

An im-

portant part in this matter was played by the acceptance

of

Aristotle's teachings by the Roman

and more particularly

by the neoplatonic (Plotinus) philosophers

and through

them by the fathers of the Christian

Church,

by Basilius (315-379) and Saint Augustine

in particular
(354-430)8.

Basilius taught that just as the Earth once upon a time

produced

various

grasses,

trees and animals by the com-

mand of God so to this day this ability has been retained

in full force and living creatures such as grasshoppers,

mice, etc., may be produced from the earth. Saint Augus-

tine accepted

the spontaneous

generation of living crea-

tures as an irrefutable

truth

was con-

cerned only to reconcile this phenomenon

of nature with

of living things the

will of God, which interferes with the usual orderly se-

quence of events, and established

the theory of spontane-

sustained

by all the force of

authority of the Christian

Church.

It is, therefore, clear why further

development

of the

problem of the origin of life remained

for a long time

within

the framework

of the teaching of spontaneous gen-

eration.

The medieval scholars in their works

merely

cor-

roborated the \"facts\" described by Aristotle of the origin

of living creatures from decaying matter,

or even supple-

mented these with still more phantastic experiments of their own. As a fitting

observations

and

comment

upon the

typical methods of studying nature in the Middle

Ages

mention may be made of the widely accepted tales of the

goose

tree, of the vegetable lamb or of the homunculus.

On the authority

very of

prominent

scholars

and nu-

merous travellers of that period

geese and ducks came

from sea shells, which themselves

had come from the fruit

of trees. Birds could also be born directly from these

fruits. This legend

of the goose tree was already expounded

by Cardinal

Pietro

Damiani

the at

beginning

of the

eleventh century. The English encyclopedist

Alexander

Neckam

(1157-1217)

evolved the theory of the origin of

birds from fir trees which came in contact with the salt of

sea water. Subsequently this theory

of the vegetable source

of geese and ducks was so generally

accepted that the use

of their meat became

common on fast days, a practice

was which

later

prohibited

by a special edict of Pope Inno-

cent III 1.

It is interesting that this theory of the goose tree sur-)))

vived

until

the

end

the of

seventeenth

and even the begin-

ning of the eighteenth

century.

A number of authors gave

their own

observations

and produced

more or less phan-

tastic drawings

which portrayed the gradual development

of birds from the fruit of trees. Evidently

this legend orig-

inated

naive from a

interpretation

of superficial

observa-

tions of a peculiar species

of barnacle,

the so called sea

ducks (Lepas anatifera). The full-grown

specimens

of

these sea animals attach

themselves

to rocks, stones, bot-

toms of boats and occasionally to a tree which has fallen

into the water, and they form a calcareous membrane

re-

sembling

a shell. On the shores of northern

Scotland,

Ire-

land

the and of

neighboring

islands this occurs at the same

time of year when the young polar geese

arrive

from the

North. These two events were somehow

associated

,vith

each other and phantasy filled in the rest of the imaginary

picture

of the relation of these birds, which

came no one

knew whence, with the little \"sea ducks\" attached to the

trunks

of trees.

Possibly analogous superficial observations were the

basis of another legend, the vegetable lamb,

which

many

travellers to the Orient have reported

(Odorico

da Porde-

none (1331), Maundeville (1300-1372) and others). Ac-

cording to their reports these travellers

had heard tales of

or had even seen plants and whole trees whose melon-like

fruit contained

full formed lambs which the local popula-

tion used for meat 9.

The story of the homunculus takes its origin in certain

alchemical experiments

and apparently

started in the first

century

of our era. It is based

on the idea that by mixing

the passive

female with the active male principle

it is pos-)))

10)

THE ORIGIN

to sible

reproduce

artificially

the phenomenon

of genera-

tion and to obtain an embryo of the little man, homunculus.

This story prevailed throughout the Middle Ages and even

in the sixteenth century the famous physician

and alche-

mist Paracelsus (1493-1541) gave an exact recipe for the

preparation of homunculus. For this purpose

it is neces-

sary to place human sperm into a special vessel and to sub-

ject this to a series of complicated manipulations

for a

definite time, when finally the little man is produced. He

requires human blood for his nourishment.

Paracelsus was a confirmed protagonist of the theory

of spontaneous generation of living beings.

He believed

that some special law governed

the organism

of animals

and man, a vital force which he called the \"spirit of life\"

(spiritus

vitae), and which determined the formation

and

further

development

of the organism. Paracelsus elabo-

rated his theory of the origin of life in conformity

with

these philosophical conceptions

and even described a series

of observations on the spontaneous

frogs, eels, turtles,

taneous

generation

of living creatures as beyond

the per-

adventure of doubt. Furthermore, he actually supported

this theory with many observations and experiments.

It is

to Van Helmont that we owe the well known recipe for

obtaining mice from wheat kernels. Since he believed that

human

sweat can furnish the generating principle, it was

enough

to place a dirty shirt into a vessel containing

wheat

germ and after 21 days, when

fermentation

would cease,

the vapors from the shirt together with the vapors of the

seeds would

generate

live mice. Van Helmont was particu-

larly surprised

to find that these artificially produced

mice

were the exact replicas of natural mice originating from

the semen of their parents 11.

Harvey (1578-1657), the discoverer

of the circulation

of the blood,

did not reject spontaneous generation al-

though

he coined the famous phrase \"Omne vivum

ex

ovo\" (all living from the egg). But he interpreted

the

word \"egg\"

very broadly

and considered

the

\"generatio

worms, insects,

aequivoca\" etc., through

(spontaneous the action

entirely possible generation) of
of special forces

liberated

in decay and analogous processes 12.

Thus the dogma enunciated by Saint Augustine

of God's

will, which arbitrarily interrupts the usual inherent order

of things, continued to dominate

over the minds of leading

men even as late as the first half of the seventeenth cen-

tury, when in all other branches of knowledge the exact

and inflexible laws of nature had already been established.

Even such luminaries of the human intellect

as Descartes

(1596-1650) qualifiedly organisms

and Newton (1643-1727) accepted

un-

the theory of spontaneous generation

of living

from lifeless matter. It is true that Descartes)))

THE ORIGIN

considered spontaneous generation

as a natural process, oc-

curring under still imperfectly

understood

circumstances,

particularly

when moist earth is exposed

to sunlight

or

when there is decay. He believed

that various

plants and

animals such as worms,

flies and other insects can origi-

nate

in this manner.

Newton gave little attention

to bio-

logical problems but he was firmly

convinced

in the possi-

bility of spontaneous generation

and even pointed out that

plants were produced

from the attenuated emanation from

the tail of comets.

The experiments

of the Tuscan physician

who had the honor

of being the first

to demolish by experimental

proofs the faith in spontane-

centuries, constitute

justly

the turning point in the history

of the spontaneous

generation theory. In the treatise

\"Es-

perienze intorno alIa generazione degl' insetti\"

(1668)

he described a series of experiments

demonstrating

that

the little white worms in meat were nothing but fly larvae.

He placed meat or fish in a large vessel covered with Nea-

politan

muslin and for greater security placed

on top of

the vessel a frame over which muslin was stretched. Al-

though flies swarmed

over the muslin no worms appeared

in the meat. Redi reports that he had succeeded

in observ-

ing how flies deposited their eggs in the muslin but that

worms in the meat developed

only when the eggs got to

the meat. From these observations he concluded

that de-

caying matter merely offers

a place or nest for the devel-

oping insects but that the deposition of eggs is a necessary

preliminary without which the worms never appear.

However, Redi did not succeed

in shaking off completely)))

and naturalist

to the Val-

Nevertheless, the belief in spontaneous

animals and plants

was

so firmly

rooted

that,

in spite

of

numerous

experimental

refutations, it persisted through-

out the entire eighteenth and even until the beginning

of

the nineteenth century. Even Lamarck 13 (1 744-1829)

in

his \"Philosophie Zoologique\"

mentions

the possibility

of

spontaneous generation of mushrooms

and certain para-

sites, although this is contrary

to his general outlook on

nature. Only very gradually

in the technique of observation of natural phenomena

been formed from amorphous silt or decaying matter. In

this manner the belief In spontaneous

generation of all

highly

organized

living things was banished from the do-

main of science. But the idea of a primary

origin itself

had not died out and indeed received a further impetus in

the eighteenth

and nineteenth centuries so far as the sim-

plest and tiniest of living things,

the microorganisms,

were

concerned.

The curious discoveries of this Dutch

investigator

at-

tracted wide attention and inspired numerous

followers.

Wherever

decay or fermentation of organic substance

took place, observers found microorganisms present. They

were found in all sorts of vegetable infusions

and decoc-

tions, in rotting meat, in spoiled

bouillon,

in sour milk, in

fermenting wort, etc. It was only necessary to put easily

decomposing

substances for a short time into a warm place

when almost immediately live microscopic

creatures

devel-

oped where they were absent before.

With the belief in

spontaneous generation still widely

held, the idea that the

origin of living microorganisms

frDm lifeless matter was

actually taking

place

before

one's eyes in these infusions

and decoctions,

easily gained ground.

Leeuwenhoek himself did not entertain

this view and

maintained that the microorganisms

developed

from some-

thing which got into the infusions from the air, and this

was also corroborated

The experiments of Joblot, however,

had not convinced

his contemporaries and the theory of spontaneous

genera-

tion retained its wide sway among

scientists.

It even re-

ceived a particularly brilliant formulation

in the works of

the famous French biologist

Buffon

(1707-1788).

Buffon

perceived in the process

of spontaneous

generation a cor-

roboration of his general hypothesis of the existence of a

special vital principle. He regarded all living

matter

as

consisting of \"organic molecules\" or particles which did

not themselves change but united with each other into ka-

leidoscopic combinations. When the dead organism decom-

posed its individual existence

came to an end, but the ma-

terials of which it was composed again recombined

forming

new living organisms. He believed that microorganisms

were thus created 16.

The same idea was developed

by Buffon's contemporary,

the Scotch minister Needham

(1713-1781),

who thought

that there was inherent

in every microscopic

particle of

organic matter

a special \"vital force\" which vitalized the

organic

material

of the infusion. Needham thus elaborated

the vitalistic

conception of the essence and creation

of life

which was quite prevalent at the time. However,

as part

experimental

investigations,

of microorganisms.

Needham reports: \"I took a quantity of mutton gravy

As a

further precaution, he then heated the vessel on hot ashes

but, in spite of all this, after a few days the vessel was

found to teem with microorganisms.

He studied by a simi-

lar procedure

various

organic liquids and infusions but

always with the same result. From these observations he

quite naturally concluded

that the spontaneous

of microorganisms from decomposing

Needham

objected,

first, that on prolonged heating

of

the liquids the air in the vessels

became

vitiated and this

was responsible for the failure

of microorganisms

to de-

velop; second,

that prolonged

heating destroyed the \"vital

of the organic

for long such

did not deem that

he heated his liquids

too gently but rather that Spallanzani

heated

his liquids

too vigorously and thus destroyed

the

creative force of the infusions.

To meet

these

objections

Spallanzani

repeated his ex-

periments

and performed

with exceptional care a large

series of tests planned to answer all of Needham's criti-

cisms 18. Nevertheless,

he failed to convince

his contempo-

raries and the theory of spontaneous

generation

of micro-

organisms counted many defenders

among

scientists

until

the middle

the of

nineteenth

century.

Especially

much work and experimental skill was con-

sumed in the attempt to clarify the significance

of the air

the in

of living things in liquids subjected to

preliminary

heating. The prominent French chemist L.

Gay-Lussac

that

oxygen

was lacking in vessels which were sealed after

their contents were boiled; in other words, the component

of air which sustains oxidation and respiration was lack-

ing. This evidently

gave support to the views

developed

by Needham. To elucidate the role of oxygen still further)))

IS)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

Gay-Lussac filled with mercury

a glass tube sealed at one

end (eudiometer)

and inserted it into a dish containing

mercury.

A single grape was introduced under the mer-

cury and crushed with a wire inserted

through

the mercury.

The juice from the crushed

grape rose to the top of the

sealed tube and for a long time remained clear and appar-

ently thoroughly

sterile. However, on admitting

a bubble

of oxygen into the tube the juice quickly started to ferment

and became

filled with microorganisms

This experiment, which had been used later very exten-

sively by the adherents

of the spontaneous generation

significant

in that

the source

the of

contamina-

tion, as we know now, was the germs on the surface of the

mercury, which

neither

the experimenter

nor his commen-

tators

had taken into consideration.

In 1836 the well known German naturalist T. Schwann,

of the cellular

eircumstances
constantly

the bouillon did not spoil and that with a renewed stream of sterile air there was thus no

spontaneous generation. However, entirely different

re-

sults were obtained when these experiments

were made

with liquids containing sugar. Although

both kinds of ex-

periment were carried out practically

the same way, in the

latter case a mass of living microorganisms

frequently ap-

peared 20.

sults. However, when Schulze's experiment

was repeated

a

number

times of

contradictory

results were obtained and in

some instances

microorganisms

developed

in the liquid 21.

Somewhat later (1853) two Heidelberg

professors,

H.

Schroder and Th. von Dusch,

simplified

the experiment

and sterilized the air by filtering it through a layer of ster-

ile cotton, which retained the microorganisms.In this way

they were able to free the air from

every

infective

cause

without subjecting it either to chemical

influence or to heat.

These experimenters

actually

found that heated meat de-

coction or beer wort could remain unchanged for many

weeks. But under

similar

conditions

milk or meat with-

out water quickly spoiled and became filled

with micro-

organisms 22.

Thus, in spite of the fact that these experiments

all tended

to disprove

the possibility

of spontaneous generation, they

did not carry sufficient conviction because, for some inex-

plicable

reason, they did occasionally fail and micro-

organisms

did appear in the tested fluids. We know, today,

that these occasional failures were due to accidental

tech-

nical slips, but at that time each failure could easily fur-

nish and actually did furnish the pretext for the interpre-

tation, that spontaneous

generation

need not necessarily

occur always but only under certain favorable conditions.

Dumas, Naegeli and many other prominent

scientists

of

accepted

this inter-

pretation.

in 1859 F. Pouchet 23 published

the articles in which he)))

20)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

tried to prove

experimentally

the possibility of spontane-

ous generation,

since it seemed entirely improbable that

liquids would

regularly

become infected with air-borne

organisms. In his extensive

work,

embracing

nearly 700

pages, Pouchet developed

the vitalistic

theory of autogen-

eration, which was essentially similar

to those of Buffon

and of Needham. He maintained that each event of auto-

generation is preceded

by fermentation

or decomposition

of organic substances

and that only substances which are

found in living organisms can generate new life. Under the

influence

of fermentation

and decay organic particles

of

dead bodies split up. For a brief

period

they wander as

free particles but are ultimately

reunited by their inherent

tendency

for association,

thus giving rise to new living

things. Since Pouchet postulated the pre-existence

of some

\"vital force\" necessary for the generation

of organisms he

never assumed that living things arose simply de novo in

the solutions

of inorganic substances. Pouchet repeated on

a large scale the work of his predecessors in an effort to

test his theory and always obtained

positive

results: in the

organic liquids, which he investigated,

microorganisms

in-

variably developed.

Pouchet's work made a big impression

upon his contem-

poraries. The French Academy of Sciences

offered a prize

for exact and convincing

experiments

which would throw

light upon the question

of the autogeneration of living

things. This prize was awarded

to Louis Pasteur 24, who in

1862 published his investigations on spontaneous

executed

experiments,

ous infusions and solutions of organic

substances.

Pasteur

succeeded only because he did not follow blindly the pat11

of empiricism, because

he had a broad conception of the

entire problem,

because

he found a rational explanation

of all the earlier experimental

attempts and pointed

out

the sources of error of his predecessors. Pasteur first of

all clarified

the problem

the of

presence

of microorgan-

isms in the air which,

as was shown previously, was re-

garded as one of the chief sources of contamination. The

adherents

of the spontaneous

generation theory, and par-

ticularly

Pouchet, not infrequently expressed doubt as to

the presence

of germs in the air and demanded

a demon-

stration of those \"swarms

of microorganisms\"

which were

supposed to inhabit

the air.

Pasteur solved this problem by the aid of a very simple

method.

He sucked air through a tube plugged

with gun

cotton. As was already shown by Schroder

and Dusch, the

finest

suspended

particles

floating in the air are retained

in the cotton and should, therefore, remain in the tube.

After a lapse of 24 hours the suction was stopped, the cot-

ton plug with its dust deposit removed and dissolved in a

mixture

of ether and alcohol whereupon the solid particles

settled

out and, after being washed with the solvent,

were

examined under the microscope. It was demonstrated

that

thousands

of organisms were thus collected

THE ORIGIN

peated, by a somewhat

modified

and improved technique,

Schwann's experiments, boiling

organic

liquids in round-

bottomed flasks whose necks were drawn out and fused to a

platinum tube. The latter were heated

to a red glow over

a gas flame.

In this way air entering the flask,

after the

boiling had ceased, passed through

the red-hot platinum

tube and was freed from germs. The air was cooled by a

stream of water

before

actually

entering the flask.

When

the flask was thus filled with air, the drawn-out neck was

sealed off in a flame and the sealed flask could be kept in

this condition for any length

of time. When experiments

were made by this procedure,

the solutions without excep-

tion remained unspoiled

and no microorganisms

appeared

in them. But if the neck of the flask was broken off and a

cotton plug,

through

troduced

into the

sealed, the contents

which solution,
of the

air had been filtered, was in-
the neck being again quickly flask after a brief interval be-

came filled with molds, bacteria and even infusoria.

It fol-

lowed, therefore, that the boiled solution did not lose its

ability to sustain

microorganisms

and that the germs of

the air arrested by the cotton plug could actually

and very

easily develop in this fluid.

Later

Pasteur

sterilized the air, with which

the flasks

were filled, without the aid of heat, by passing it, as

Schroder and Dusch did, through

a cotton plug, or by an

original method

which he himself devised. Generally Pas-

teur half filled the round flask with the fluid to be studied,

softened the neck in a torch flame and pulled it out in the form of a letter S. The contents were then boiled without

further precautions. When steam was being

discharged

vigorously,

the flame was removed and the flask allowed)))

SPONTANEOUS

GENERATION)

23)

to cool off. Under these conditions

the contents remained un-

changed even though

there was direct contact with the out-

side atmosphere

through the bent tube, because

dust and

germs carried in with the air became

imprisoned

in the

bend of the tube. However,

as soon as the bent portion

of

the tubulature

was cut off, the contents

became quickly in-

habited by microorganisms.

In these experiments the air

was no longer

subjected

to any treatment and yet no con-

tamination of the liquid occurred so long as the entrance

was blocked to germs floating

in the air.

Further experiments of Pasteur have shown

that the

number of viable microorganisms in the air was far from

constant, varying according

to the season of the year or

locality. The largest number

of germs was found in the

atmosphere

of cities and thickly inhabited places. The air

from fields or forests has fewer microorganisms while in

mountainous

regions,

especially

at high altitudes, the num-

ber of tiny creatures floating in the air is negligible.

It is

possible, therefore,

to open flasks with sterile contents at

such

altitudes

without necessarily

inoculating them. In a

number

of instances such flasks were once more sealed off

and remained

sterile, although mountain air which was not

purified had entered those flasks.

At the same time Pasteur demonstrated that air was not

the only source of contamination

of organic fluids. He

showed that germs of microorganisms

are found on the

surfaces of all objects used in the experiments, and for

this reason all these surfaces

must be scrupulously disin-

fected. Pasteur showed

that the development

of micro-

organisms in the experiments

of previous investigators had

always been

to due to the failure, owing

methodological)))

24

THE ORIGIN

shortcomings,

to exclude completely every source

tamination.

Thus, for instance, Pasteur demonstrated

of conby

direct experiments

that the grape juice in Gay-Lussac's

tests was contaminated

with microorganisms adhering to

the surface

of the mercury. In other

cases the vessels were

not sufficiently

sterilized.

And, as Pasteur so brilliantly

proved it by numerous

experiments,

if every source of

error was removed,

the solutions could be made sterile in

one hundred

per cent of the trials. Furthermore, Pasteur

succeeded
as urine

in showing that such easily decomposing fluids and blood could be preserved for an indefinite

time without

heating or any other treatment,

provided

they

were removed contamination

from the organism with precautions

by germs from the outside.

Under

against
such con-

ditions the body fluids do not decompose and can be kept

indefinitely.

Pasteur, therefore, not only obtained

exact and uniform

results but also explained

satisfactorily

the contradictory

findings

other of

investigators.

He refuted the hypothesis

that decaying infusions generate

microorganisms

and dem-

onstrated that, on the contrary,

decay of these fluids was

the result of the activity of microorganisms,

which had

been

introduced

from the outside.

Obviously the adherents of the autogeneration

of mi-

crobes did not capitulate

at once and many experiments

were still performed

after

the publication

of Pasteur's

work, which seemed to indicate

the possibility of sponta-

neous generation

under some special conditions. The most

serious and interesting

were the experiments of Bastian 25,

who showed that microorganisms

fusions even when the flasks

are opened

or when the air with Pasteur's investigations so far as the factual

were

Bastian's

experiments

concerned, but he de-

nied that they had really anything to do with spontaneous

generation of organisms. Spores

of the hay bacillus are

present in infusions. These are very resistant

to heating

and retain the ability to multiply

even after prolonged

boiling.

infusions

are autoclaved

at 120 0 or if they

are boiled twice in succession,

other organic

liquids,

provided

they remain

sterile just as

they are not subjected to

air-borne

contamination.

The two successive boilings act

in the following manner: the first time only the vegetative
forms of bacteria are killed off, the spores remaining un-

affected;

upon cooling the boiled infusion these spores

de-

velop into bacteria, which are killed by the repeated

boil-

ing before they have formed

new spores.

After Bastian no one offered

any serious criticisms of

Pasteur, and every attempt

to disprove his theses or to dis-

cover instances of spontaneous generation of some microbe

proved entirely futile. From our present

point of view this

quite is

understandable,

since

microorganisms

are not

merely bits of organic

matter, as was thought before Pas-

teur. A close study of these simplest living things has re-

vealed

that they possess a delicate and complicated

or-

ganization.

In this respect the structure

of the unicellular

microorganisms differed but little from the structure of the

separate cells composing

the multicellular

organisms. It is

totally improbable

that such a complex and at the same

time strictly definite organization could appear in a very

short

time, before our eyes, so to speak, from

unorganized

solutions

of organic substances. Such a supposition

is no)))

26)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

less absurd than the idea of the origin of frogs from the

May dew or of lions from the desert sand.

Thus, it seemed that the theory of the spontaneous gen-

eration of living beings was interred forever, yet in a com-

paratively

short time it was once more resurrected in a

somewhat

refurbished

and modernized form. In a number

of diseases

of man, animals and plants, as for instance

in

typhus, smallpox, hoof and mouth

disease

of cattle, mo-

saic disease of tobacco

and potato no bacteria or any other

pathogenic

microorganisms

could be discovered. However,

the unquestionable

infectiveness

as well as the general

symptoms

of these diseases are so very similar to bacterial

infections

that the causative agents had to be recognized

as living things analogous to bacteria,

and have been desig-

as nated

viruses.

Viruses are of such infinitesimal size that

they

cannot

be detected even under the most powerful

mi-

croscopes and for the same reason pass easily through

bac-

terial filters. Ultrafiltration

experiments have established

that the magnitude of these various viruses is somewhat

of

the order of 50-70 millimicrons [a millimicron

is one mil-

lionth of a millimeter], and are thus considerably

smaller

than ordinary bacteria [the magnitude

of cocci is usually

500-2000 millimicrons]. There is no evidence

that viruses

occur anywhere except in the living or in recently deceased

animals. In recent years a number

of investigators

have

made reports of the successful

cultivation of filterable

viruses in artificial nutritive

media,

but these reports must

and Gardner 26, therefore,

is partly sub-

stantiated by the fact iliat there are a number of organ-

CHAPTER II)
THE 0 R I E S OF THE CON TIN U I T Y
OF LIFE)

By HIS EXPERIMENTS

Pasteur

demonstrated

beyond per-

adventure of doubt the impossibility

of autogeneration of

his life in the sense as it was imagined by

predecessors.

He showed that living organisms cannot be formed

sud-

denly before our eyes from

formless

solutions

and infu-

sions. A careful survey of the experimental

evidence re-

veals, however, that it tells nothing about the impossibility

of generation

of life at some other epoch

or under some

other conditions. Incidentally, Pasteur himself,

with his

usual reserve, placed such an interpretation

on his own ex-

periments. His contemporaries, interpretation on his data,

however, considering

put a broader them as absolute

the proof of

impossibility

of a transition from dead mat-

ter to living

organisms.

For instance, the famous English

physicist

Lord

Kelvin

(1871)

expressed himself very

clearly that, on the basis of Pasteur's experiments, the im-

possibility

of autogeneration of life at any time or any-

where must be regarded established as firmly

as the law of

universal gravitation. The same viewpoint

has been shared

by a number of investigators,

for whom life is radically

different

from the rest of inanimate nature. Therefore,

in

their opinion, it is wrong even to pose the question of the

origin of life, since life is as much an eternal category

as

matter itself. Life is eternal, it only changes

its form but

is never created

from dead substance.

29)))

3\302\260)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

At first sight the impression

is gained that Pasteur's ex-

periments

caused

a complete

reversal

the in

conceptions

of

naturalists

with regard to the origin of life. Previously

it

was believed that living organisms were easily generated

from dead matter, before our very eyes, so to speak; then

the attitude was taken that life can never originate but

must

exist eternally.

This contradiction in viewpoints is

only

apparent

and

a careful

examination

the of

question

shows that both the theory of spontaneous generation

and

the theory of the continuity of life are based on the same

dualistic outlook

on nature. Both theories start essentially

with the same assumption

that life is endowed

with abso-

lute autonomy determined by special principles

and forces,

applicable

only to organisms, the nature

of which is radi-

cally different

from the principles and forces operative in

the inanimate

kingdom.

But from
view of the
living nature,

the opposite point of view, from the point of unity of forces operative in living and non-
the spontaneous generation of organisms, as

described

in the preceding chapter, is altogether impossi-

ble and unthinkable.

As already emphasized before,

even

the simplest of living organisms possesses

a very complex

structure or organization. We are not familiar

with physi-

calor chemical forces which could cause under the de-

scribed experimental conditions

the appearance

of organ-

isms from structureless solutions

of organic

substances.

Therefore, the sudden generation

of organisms

can be

explained either with St. Augustine

as an act of divine

will (miracle)

or as the result of some special

vital force.

Actually, throughout the history of this problem,

the con-

ception of a spontaneous

generation

is intimately

a ated with the idea of \"vital

force\".

It is the Aristotelian

\"entelechy\"

embracing

all matter and forming it purpose-

fully

into living organisms.

is It

the spirit

of life, \"spiritus

vitae\" of Paracelsus, the \"archai\"

of Van Helmont which,

according to his views, reside in seeds and direct the processes of creation and of autogeneration. Finally, it is Leib-

niz' \"monads\" which represent the immutable

centers of

force of a spiritual character. Similarly,

the later adher-

the ents of

spontaneous

generation

of life, Buffon, Need-

ham, Pouchet,

are all among the most convinced vitalists

who believe

that a vital force, capable of vivifying

the or-

ganic substance of solutions and infusions,

is dormant

in

every microscopic particle of organic

matter. The action

of this force is not bound by any general physical laws, it

is entirely

\"sui generis\" and, therefore, can transform non-

living into living matter in the wink of an eye.

It is hardly necessary to prove that the same vitalistic

conception, the same dualism is at the bottom of the theory

of the continuity or eternity

of life. No matter what form

the theories

of continuity of life may assume, they always

leave an unabridgeable gap between the kingdom

of organ-

isms and of inorganic nature. But to say that life never

had an origin and existed

eternally,

is to imply that there

is an absolute

autonomy

of living organisms.

F. Engels 1 in his \"Dialectics of Nature\" subjected both

the theory of spontaneous generation and the theory

eternity of life to a withering

criticism.

Discussing

views according to which

new living organisms

can

vancing

step in this process, products

are formed

which

are nearer to the inorganic

world, products which are pro-

gressively less utilizable

in the organic world. But the

process

may be given a different

direction

and the decom-

position products may be made utilizable,

if they enter the

organism.\"

Furthermore,

with

regard to experiments

attempting

to prove the primary

generation,

he remarks

ironically:

\"It would be foolish to

try and force nature to accomplish in twenty

four hours,

with the aid of a bit of stinky water, that which it took her

many thousands

of years to do.\"

But Engels likewise rejects

the conception

of the eter-

nity of life. He quotes a very characteristic statement

by

Liebig: \"It is sufficient to admit that life is as old and as

eternal as matter

itself, and the entire argument about the

origin of life loses apparently all sense by this simple ad-

mission. And, really, why can we not imagine that organic

carbon

combinations,

matter and the forces which

are eternally

bound up with

that such a view can only be based upon the recognition

of some special life force

principle,

which is entirely incompatible

with the materialistic

conception. Engels notes further

about carbon compounds

instance,

But to this day no one has
even such simple carbon

ever asserted that, for compounds as C02 or

CH4 are eternal in the sense of having existed at all times,

instead of being constantly

formed from certain elements

and decomposed

again into the same elements. If living

protein

is eternal

in the same sense as other

carbon

pounds, it must not only break up constantly

into its ele-

ments, as actually happens,

but it must also be constantly

formed

anew from these elements without the cooperation

of preexisting

protein. This is diametrically opposed

to

Liebig's results.

The same holds true, even in a larger measure, with

regard to living organisms.

ways arise under definite conditions has nothing

to do with

the conception

the of

of life. On the contrary, it

emphasizes non-living

matter. But the adherents of the theory

of the

of life assume that at all times some principle ex-

isted eternally, which passed on from organism to organ-

ism, and without

which the origin of living things would

be impossible.

Following this path of reasoning we invari-

ably fall into the pit of vitalistic conceptions.

Engels shows that a consistent materialistic philosophy

can follow only a single path in the attempt

to solve the

problem of the origin of life. Life has neither arisen spon-

taneously

nor has it existed eternally. It must have, there-

resulted

related theory of panspermia,

outlooks and, besides,

it has now chiefly a historical inter-

Starting from the empirically verifiable all organisms are derived from similar

that Preyer

poses this question: \"Is not the problem of the origin of

life based on a wrong assumption that the living must have

come sometime from the non-living?

All organisms invari-

ably originate from other living organisms. On the other

hand, inorganic non-living

substance

does now

originate

not only from other lifeless matter

but

also from living organisms which either discard it as a

dead mass or leave it behind

after death.\"

But if substance

the living has never

originated

from non-living

and has always come from the living, then it

existed

even at the time when the Earth was still

a molten mass. Preyer actually

accepts

this conclusion and

regards as living not only the present-day

organisms but

also the molten

liquid mass which existed in the remote

antiquity.

\"If we rid ourselves of the idea wholly arbitrary

and unsupported by facts that protoplasm can exist only in

its present

composition,

and of the old convenient preju-

dice that at first there was only inorganic

substance,

we can

without fear take the next bold step, discard altogether all

belief

in a primary origin, and recognize the timelessness

of the current of life.\)

THE CONTINUITY

OF LIFE)

35)

On such foundations Preyer sketches approximately the

following

picture of the continuous life. Originally the en-

tire fiery liquid mass of the Earth was a single mighty or-

ganism whose life was manifested

in the motion of its sub-

stance.

But as the Earth began to cool the substances

which

could no longer remain in the liquid state separated as a

hard mass and formed the dead inorganic substance. This

process

continued

further, but at first the molten liquid

masses

alone represented

in life on Earth

contradistinction

to the inorganic

bodies. \"Only when these

combinations

had

i.e. died out, combinations

of elements appeared which till

then had remained in gaseous and liquid state, and which

have gradually taken on the semblance

foundation of everything living to-day.

. . . We, therefore,

assert that motion

is the beginning of life in the world,

and

that protoplasm is the residuum which must have been left

over after the substances

as inorganic had

THE ORIGIN

nity of life with the conception

of the origin of our planet.

All adherents

of this theory assumed that life existed eter-

nally, that it was never created,

never separated from dead

material. But how then did life originate on the Earth? The

Earth itself is not eternal, since it must have had a begin-

ning sometime, having separated

from the Sun, and cer-

tainly during the early period of its existence could not

have been populated

with organisms, simply because

of

unfavorable

temperature

conditions. To overcome this diffi-

culty, the idea was promoted that germs of life dropped to

the Earth from the interstellar

and interplanetary

spaces just

as they get into Pasteur's

flasks from the outside

air. This

conception

was first elaborated in 1865 by Richter

bodies,

that, owing to the very fast small fragments or hard par-

ticles could have become detached, and that viable

spores

of microorganisms

could also have been carried

away

from the cosmic bodies together

with these detached par-

ticles. The particles, floating

in the interstellar

space,

could be carried accidentally to other cosmic bodies and,

landing on a planet

where conditions

for life were already

favorable

(moderate

humidity

and temperature),

com-

mence to develop

and later become the ancestors of the en-

tire organic kingdom of that planetary body.

Richter

assumed that somewhere in the universe there were always

cosmic bodies present on which life exists in cellular form.

Later this idea was also developed

4
by Liebig who believed

that \"the atmosphere of celestial bodies

as well as of

whirling cosmic nebulae can be regarded

as the timeless

sanctuary of animate forms,

of or-)))

ganic germs.\" Therefore, the existence of living organisms

in the universe

is eternal, organic life is never

really

created but only transmitted from one planet to the next.

The problem, according

to Richter,

is not how life orig-

inates but how the germs of life can be carried

from one

celestial body to the other.

Richter paid special attention to the possibility

of trans-

fer of viable germs

through

the universal spaces separat-

ing celestial bodies.

He pointed out that organic germs in

a dormant

state can exist a long time without

water

or

nourishment

but become revivified as soon as the condi-

tions favor this, and therefore journeys. The only danger

germs can endure very long to the existence of these germs

comes from the rise in temperature resulting from the tre-

mendous friction as the body falls through the Earth's at-

mosphere. However,

some

meteorites

contain traces of

carbon and other

easily

inflammable

substances. If those

substances could reach the Earth without burning up, it is

quite

possible

for germs also to traverse the atmosphere

without losing their viability.

H. von Helmholtz

5 developed

a similar idea a number

of years after Richter. This well known

German

physiol-

ogist stated that organic life either had to begin sometimes

or else it must have existed

eternally,

but he inclined to the

second

alternative

and thought that live germs were

brought

to the Earth by meteorites. He based this possibil-

ity upon the fact that meteorites, on passing

through

the

Earth's atmosphere, are heated

only on the surface while

the interior remains cool. He comments as follows: \"Who

would deny that such bodies floating everywhere in the)))

3 8)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

universal space do not leave behind

wherever the planetary

conditions

them the germs of life, are already suitable to

promote

organic

creation!\"

However, in his introduction to Thomson's

\"Treatise

on

Theoretical Physics\" Helmholtz 6 has this to say about the

theory

of cosmozoa:

\"If anyone is inclined to regard this

hypothesis

as not very probable

or indeed highly question-

able, I have nothing

to say against this. But it seems to me

that if every attempt to create organisms from inanimate

is matter

has failed us, it

entirely

within

the domain of

scientific discussion to inquire whether life had ever been

created, whether

it is not just as old as matter

itself and,

finally, whether germs are not carried

from one celestial

to body

another,

taking root and developing wherever they

find favorable

soil.\"

Thus, even Helmholtz did not feel entirely convinced

in

the correctness

of his reasoning. The theory

itself,

too,

soon disappeared

the from

scientific

horizon,

since the

most painstaking search of meteorites

failed to reveal in

them not only organisms

or their remnants, but even traces

of sedimentary or biochemical formations. Only in the very

last few years Ch. Lipman

7 attempted

once more to re-

suscitate these ideas. He examined a number of rocky

meteorites

for possible traces of living organisms. Using

a very intricate technique

to preclude

the possibility of

contaminating the meteorites

with earth bacteria, he came

to the conclusion

that live bacteria and their spores

are

found

in the interior

the of

meteorites.

The organisms

which he succeeded in isolating were identical

with the

bacterial

forms existing on the Earth.

This makes it very

probable that, in spite of all his precautions, Lipman did)))

THE CONTINUITY

39)

not succeed in preventing earth bacteria from contaminat-

ing the meteorites while they were ground

to a powder.

Even in different

regions

of our planet there are different

forms strange

of microorganisms,

and it would be extremely

if exactly the same bacterial forms found on the

Earth were present also on some remote planets.

At the beginning of the twentieth century the idea of the

transfer of germs from one celestial body to another

was

again revived in the form of the so-called

theory of pan-

spermia, originated

by the great Swedish physical chemist

S. Arrhenius.

Being

a strong

adherent

the of

conception

that life is scattered throughout universal space, he showed

very convincingly,

by means of direct

calculations,

the

possibility of transfer of particles

from one celestial body

to another.

The principal

activating force is the pressure

by light rays, discovered by Clerk Maxwell and

due to a number of causes, there are always electrical

dis-

charges which are strong enough to shoot

particles from the Earth's atmosphere

into

these material the interplane-

tary space, where they are driven farther and farther by

the one-sided

pressure

of the Sun's light rays. Under

cer-

tain conditions, this results in the formation

THE ORIGIN

parably smaller dimensions. This tail is formed by the

finest particles of matter always leaving the Earth and re-

pelled

by the action of the Sun's rays.

According

to Arrhe-

nius, similar phenomena occur on the other planets also.

In this way tiny particles

of substance must be cast off

all the time from the Earth's surface as well as from the

surface of other celestial bodies.

If a planet is inhabited

by live organisms, particularly microorganisms,

their

spores would be thus carried off into the interstellar

space.

Arrhenius calculated that bacterial

spores with a diameter

of 0.0002-0.00015 mm. move with very great speed in the

empty

space under the influence of pressure of the Sun's

rays. Separated from the Earth, such spores will pass be-

yond the limits of our planetary

system in 14 months, and

in 9000 years will reach the nearest star, a.-Centauri.

The movement

of spores of microorganisms may be not

only away from

but also back towards the Sun. Living

germs carried off into the interstellar space may meet with

particles of cosmic dust of relatively

large size. If a spore

attaches

itself to a particle with a diameter of over 0.0015

mm. its movement is reversed and it then moves towards

the Sun, because the light pressure will no longer be able

to overcome the gravitation

of the heavy particles to the

Sun. Arrhenius thinks

that in this way the Earth could

from Arrhenius

and other adherents of this theory.

Arrhenius

discusses in detail all the dangers

to living

germs lurking along their path from planet to planet. Ac-

cording to Arrhenius

the absence of moisture or oxygen

the and the extreme cold of

interplanetary

space

present

no terrors for the microorganismal spores,

no\037 does

the

heating of the particles, as they fall rapidly through the

Earth's atmosphere, endanger their existence.

From his cal-

culations Arrhenius concludes that the heat does not ex-

ceed 100 0 and lasts only a short time. Since bacterial

spores

are known to remain viable after such treatment,

he thinks it is reasonable to regard the transport

of viable

germs from one planetary

system to another as the cause

of the origin of life on Earth. This theory

has many sup-

porters, being especially energetically upheld

by Kos-

tychev 9.
However, the farther research is carried

in this direc-

tion, and the better we become acquainted with the world

around us, the more new facts come to light, which

con-

tradict radically this theory and make it seem less and less

probable

that such a transfer of viable germs from one

celestial body to another

formed

it was necessary for some celestial body,

some

star of approximately the same mass as our Sun, to come

relatively close to it at a remote period of its existence. As

a result of attraction between the Sun and that passing

a colossal cloud of superheated

gases was thrown out from

the surface

of the Sun, out of which our planetary

system,

including the Earth, was subsequently formed.

But this sort of meeting or approach between

two stars

in the universal space could be only an extremely rare

event. The following

how little probability

there is that the apples

(celestial

bodies) would ever meet. The famous contemporary

lish astronomer

to calcula-

tions, the probability

therefore, that, from the point

life is cir-

cumscribed

existence

in an insignificantly

little nook

of the universe.

Thus

modern

astronomical

conceptions offer no support

to the ideas of a ubiquitous distribution of life germs

throughout the universe. Of course, this does not mean that life exists only on our Earth. We still have too little infor-

mation to deny completely

the possibility of existence of

organisms

on some other planets, whirling around stars

similar to our Sun. But there can be no doubt that these

Therefore, the transport

to another would require not thousands of

years, as Arrhenius thought, but at least many hundreds of

thousands

or even millions of years.

These long periods alone would make transport of viable

improbable.

But the investigations of the

last years

on short wave interstellar

radiations remove such

a possibility

completely.

microorganisms

us from

their destructive effect. Life germs carried beyond

the

limits of this atmosphere would be inevitably

killed off by

the ultraviolet radiation penetrating

The believers in the theory

of panspermia

attempted to

ward off this objection

by pointing out that since the photo-

reactions provoked by ultraviolet rays kill the

microorganisms

only in the presence of oxygen and water,

their lethal effect would not be exerted in the vacuum

Their effects

In this article many facts

iron and nickel

tected against cosmic radiation would not only be abso-

lutely doomed to perish,

but even their inner chemical

structure

would

must,

therefore,

once and for all give up the idea that life

CHAPTER III)

THEORIES OF THE ORIGIN OF LIFE

AT

SOME

DISTANT

PERIOD

OF THE

EARTH'S EXISTENCE)

FROM

THE PRECEDING TWO CHAPTERS we learned that

neither

the theory of the spontaneous generation

nor the

theory of the continuity of life solves rationally the prob-

lem of the origin of life on Earth. These theories invariably

come in conflict with the objectively established facts de-

rived from a careful and detailed study of the world

around us. This is not hard to understand

since these

theories are based

on the tacit assumption of an absolutely

impassable

hiatus between animate and inanimate nature.

Already

in the second half of the last century

attempts

were made to solve the problem

of the origin of life on the

basis of materialistic

conceptions and we find such tend-

encies in the work of Bastian 1. Although

he, like the vital-

ists, set out to prove the possibility of autogeneration of

microbes, he did so along principally

different lines. Thus,

unlike Pouchet,

Bastian

considered

it entirely possible that

living

things

originated

from inorganic substances without

the intervention

of any specific vital force (archebiosis).

Ch. Darwin 2 in one of his letters to Wallace criticized

Bas-

tian's experiments

and considered them altogether

improb-

able. While he admits the correctness

of the idea of arche-

biosis, he pointed

out that spontaneous

generation had not

been

proven.

According

to Darwin life must have originated

45)))

46)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

sometime, somehow, but how this happened was still un-

known.

A. Weisman 3 somewhat later developed the same idea.

Rejecting

decisively

that life must have

any vitalistic tendencies, he believed arisen sometime or other from inan-

imate

matter.

He thought that, at the very beginning

and

under conditions unknown to us now, the simplest, tiniest

organismal forms,

the \"biophores\"

were created. The more

highly organized

beings

developed

from these at a later

period.

Haeckel's theory

of archegony4

is based on similar

ideas. He refused

to believe that the hypothesis of cosmozoa

can explain the origin of life on Earth. Since at one time

the Earth must have been in a condition which precluded

any possibility

of organic life, animate substance must

have arisen from inanimate

substance at some moment in

the development

of the Earth. The fact that autogeneration

of microorganisms

is not observed at the present

time does

not contradict this assumption.

It would still have betn

possible for organisms to originate

from non-living matter

at some remote

period

of the existence of our planet,

be-

cause the external conditions at that time were entirely

different from those prevailing at the present

day. In

Haeckel's opinion the organisms, which originated

by spon-

taneous generation, must have been the lowest, simplest

things

satisfactory,

because of the lack of reliable data concerning

the extremely

peculiar conditions existing on the Earth's

surface at the time organisms made their first appearance.

Thus, Haeckel placed the center of gravity

of the whole

problem of the origin of life in the peculiar physical con-

ditions

prevailing

at one time on the Earth. He could see

no difference between the formation

of a crystal and of a

living cell. The simplest

living thing, the \"non-nucleated

monera\", crystallized out mechanically substance 5. But herein lies Haeckel's

from fundamental

inanimate error,

because it implies that simplest arise all at once from inorganic

organisms

can actually

matter, the whole thing

depending

merely on the presence of some peculiarly fa-

vorable

external physical forces which determine the trans-

formation

of inanimate substance into an animate being.

Furthermore,

according

to his theory, such forces existed

only during the dim past of the Earth's history

and have

been so completely lost, that spontaneous

generation

is no

longer possible at the present

time.

Another German biologist E. Pfliiger

6 approached

this

problem from a somewhat different

angle. He searched for

the causation of life not only in the peculiarity of external

conditions

but

also

the in

properties

selves, from which

organisms

must

of the substances them-
have been formed. He

built up his theory on the basis of the chemical

properties

of proteins, with which

he identified

indissociably

the es-

sence of the vital process.

Pfliiger

supposed

that in the or-

ganism there

are two principally

different categories of

protein: dead, or storage

protein,

and live protoplasmic

protein. In the first category

belong such proteins as egg

white,

proteins

stored in seeds, etc., which

are chemically)))

THE ORIGIN

very stable, inert substances.

In the absence of microorgan-

isms these

proteins

can be preserved an indefinitely long

time without

undergoing

tions. On the contrary,

any substantial chemical alterathe live protein of protoplasm is

an extremely

unstable substance. This instability or lability

is, according to Pfliiger,

the basis of all chemical transfor-

mations

of metabolism

within the living cell. Every

living

thing undergoes

less more or

degradation,

which

depends

upon the presence of special chemical groupings

in the live

protein. The live protein

must possess

the ability to be..

come autoxidized

by the oxygen of air, because

carbon

dioxide

is always formed in the degradation

of living sub-

stance. But carbon

dioxide

can not be formed by the direct

oxidation

of carbon atoms and the splitting

off of mole-

cules of C02. The products

of degradation

obtained from

decomposing dead protein

or the dead protein itself are en-

tirely

incapable

of such oxidation. Therefore, live protein

must contain some atomic groups or special radicles which

are capable of autolysis and of autoxidation. A number

of

considerations

led Pfliiger

the to

hypothesis

that the mole-

cule of live protein

is characterized

by the presence of a

cyanogen (CN) radicle. Pfliiger

derived

the fundamental

proof of this from

his comparative

study of nitrogenous

products of protein olism of the living

decomposition organism

obtained in the metab-

the and of

corresponding

decomposition

products

of dead protein resulting from

artificial

cleavage.

These products differ radically from

each other, the characteristic products resulting from the

metabolism

of live protein in the organism,

such as urea,

uric acid, etc., never being duplicated

in the artificial split-

ting of dead protein. These characteristic substances, how-)))

But the formation of cyanogen is associated

with the ab-

sorption of much heat, and the calorimetric

study of cyan-

ogen shows that this radicle contains a large amount

of

energy. Pfliiger supposed that in the formation

of cellular

substance, i.e. of live protein,

from

latter underwent

a change, probably

the food protein, the associated with con-

siderable heat absorption,

resulting

from the chemical

union between the carbon

and nitrogen

atoms to form

cyanogen (CN). Thus, the introduction

of cyanogen into liv-

ing matter

imparts

to it lability, which explains the tendency

of the protein to undergo decomposition

and autoxidation.

The atoms in cyanogen, according

to Pfliiger, have a strong

oscillatory movement.

all the properties of live

protoplasm to the presence in its protein component of a

definite

chemical

grouping

cyanogen

radicle,

and on

this basis developed his whole theory of the origin of life.

the Earth was either entirely or partly

that life

was formed at a

time when the Earth was a red hot mass. . . . If one thinks

of the immeasurably long period

of time during which the

Earth's surface was cooling

at an exceedingly

slow rate,

cyanogen and its compounds

had plenty of time and oppor-

tunity

to follow their great tendency to transformation

and

polymerization,

and by the addition of oxygen

and, later,

also of water and salts to change to a labile protein, which

constitutes

living

matter.\"

Modem biochemistry has completely discarded the

fundamental

conceptions

of a labile autoxidizable live

protein,

such as Pfliiger postulated. Not only protein

but

other organic substances as well, for instance

the hydro-

carbons,

which are very stable,

chemically

inert com-

pounds, undergo quite rapid changes

and transformations

within the living cells of the organism.

This depends upon

the presence

in living cells of a whole system

of catalyzers,

the enzymes, which increase to an extraordinary

degree the

speed of definite

chemical

reactions, thus making the metab-

olism of matter possible. Of course, the nitrogenous metab-

olism also depends upon enzymatic action, but it proceeds

along lines altogether different

from

those which Pfliiger)))

imagined. Neither storage

protein

nor protoplasmic

protein

can be oxidized directly by oxygen of the air. The protein

degradation

in the living cell generally commences as a

hydrolytic

cleavage resulting in peptones and amino acids.

These

cleavage

products undergo oxidation through a fairly

complex

enzymatic

system, and not directly by oxygen

of

the air but by the bound oxygen

of water. The nitrogen is

always split off at first as ammonia. Urea, uric acid, etc.,

are formed by secondary syntheses and certainly have

nothing

to do with a cyanogen radicle in the protein mole-

cule. It becomes, therefore,

more and more doubtful

whether the presence

of a cyanogen radicle in protoplasmic

protein

is really essential. In any event, it can be said with

certainty

that

no radicles

or separate

molecular groups

of

any of the known compounds can account

for the totality of

the vital properties committed a grievous

of the organism. Pfliiger undoubtedly

error in oversimplifying

the complex

phenomena which

constitute

the cellular metabolism of

matter 7.

Nevertheless,

Pfluger's

theory deserves an exceptional

place

in the development

of our ideas on the origin of life.

Pfliiger was the first to realize the possibility of a primary

origin

of organic substances which, because of their enor-

mous content of chemical energy are also extensively

en-

dowed with capacity for further change

and transformation.

He was the first to point out that \"carbon dioxide is not the

beginning

but the end of life.\"

Later this statement

was completely

forgotten and a

number of subsequent

authors, discussing the conditions

under which

life originated

on Earth, considered it indu-

bitable

that all the carbon in the atmosphere

of our planet)))

52)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

was in the form of carbon dioxide gas. A certain interest

attaches

to Allen's

8 theory

from this point

of view. Like

Pfliiger, he also focused

attention

chiefly on the nitrogen,

which he regarded as different

from all other elements be-

cause its compounds

are characterized

by considerable

chemical instability (in other words, by chemical activity).

This accounts for the ability of this element to form mobile

atomic

complexes,

which are characteristic of living sub-

stance.

Allen did not refer to cyanogen

or some other rad-

icle but assumed, nevertheless,

that some active nitrogenous

molecules were responsible

for metabolism.

\"Every vital

phenomenon represents the combination

of oxygen with or

the separation

of oxygen from nitrogen.\" Allen accordingly

developed

a view which, though similar to that of Pfliiger,

was less definite and indeed rather nebulous.

But when

these views regarding the origin of life are compared, they

are found to differ radically,

since Allen assumed that car-

bon dioxide was the primary carbon compound.

The carbon

dioxide reacts with nitrogen compounds

liberating

oxygen.

Thus pri.mary living substance from the very start mani-

fests all the properties

found in living organisms. To fur-

nish a source of energy for these reactions,

Allen resorted

to powerful electrical discharges and to solar light absorbed

either by dissolved or by suspended

iron compounds

in

water. In general he produced

a highly complicated picture

the of

formation

of living substance from non-living inor-

ganic compounds,

a picture neither definite nor convincing.

Much later, indeed in the twentieth

century,

H. Osborn 9

developed

somewhat

similar ideas in his book \"The Origin

and Evolution of Life\". In the beginning

he pictures

the)))

LIFE AT SOME

53

Earth still uninhabited

by living creatures,

thickly blan-

keted with an atmosphere

containing

much water vapor and

carbon dioxide. This carbon

dioxide

served as the source

of carbon for the formation

of organic substances from

which organisms developed

by a long process of evolution.

\"We may accept the hypothesis that in the earliest

periods

of organization of living matter

there was a combination of

the ten elements

essential

for life. Of these the four most

important elements were derived from their primary

com-

binations of water, bound

nitrogen

(volcanic

eruptions)

and carbon dioxide of the atmosphere.\"

But Osborn fails

to explain

how such a transformation could occur, limiting

himself entirely to the rather ambiguous statement about

the \"attractive

force\" between oxygen and hydrogen.

As will be shown later, these assertions of a primary

origin of carbon

dioxide

in the atmosphere of our planet

are entirely

arbitrary

not and do

correspond

to reality.

In

the history of our ideas on the origin of life they played

an important

though entirely negative role, because of the

very significant

deductions

to which they led and which

only helped to confuse the whole problem.

Because,

if at

the time living things

first appeared

on the Earth's surface

there

were no organic substances, only carbon dioxide,

water,

oxygen,

nitrogen and a number of mineral

salts be-

ing present, then obviously

the primary

organisms must

have been endowed with an ability

to assimilate

s1}.ch sub-

stances and to be nourished

as by them just

contemporary

plants

are nourished.

V. Omeljanski in his \"Principles

of

Microbiology\"

10 says:

\"The pioneers of life undoubtedly

were some

very primitive

organisms

which

but were able to synthesize

organic substance

bon dioxide,

oxygen

from and

inorganic nitrogen

compounds,

from car-

of the air as well as the

different mineral salts. In this group

of microbes

with a

primitive metabolism belong

the nitrifying

organisms, the

nitrogen assimilating bacteria

and perhaps

also the blue-

green algae.\"

But all these

living

organisms

possess a complex struc-

ture, and to accomplish

the synthesis of organic compounds

from dead matter they must also be endowed with a spe-

cialized

physico-chemical

structure or apparatus. How

could such combinations

arise

directly

from carbon di-

oxide, water and mineral salts? V. Omeljanski,

reflecting

the viewpoint of his time, offers this very simple answer:

\"When the Earth cooled off and the existence of organic

life became possible, it appeared as the result of an un-

known combination of matter and energy.\"

By the end of the nineteenth

and the beginning of the

twentieth

century,

parallel

to these attempts to picture

the

origin of life at some remote

geological

epoch, a different

movement was started

to solve the problem of the origin

of life experimentally.

The movement

an was

outgrowth

of

investigations

on the so-called models of living cells, like

the artificial cell of Traube.

Traube

11 placed

a small crys-

tal of copper sulfate in an aqueous solution

of potassium

ferrocyanide.

At the. surface of contact a membrane of cop-

per ferrocyanide is formed,

which is insoluble in water.

goes into solution

the osmotic

tears. The copper sulfate

solution

escapes

through

the

crack and, as it comes in contact with the potassium ferro-

cyanide solution, new copper ferrocyanide is immediately

formed

which repairs the break, but now the bag has some-

what increased. As this repeats

itself,

the little bag con-

tinually grows,

assuming

a definite shape and size. Traube

thought

that his artificial cell imitated the growth

of real

living cells and that the study of this model would lead to

very much as amebae take up algae, many other investigators constructed

the phenomena

substance dissolved. For instance, a solution containing 342 grams of ordi-

nary sugar in one liter (molar concentration), if it is separated

by a semi-

permeable

membrane from pure water, draws the water to itself with a force

equal to 22.4 atmospheres.

An atmosphere is equal to the pressure of a col-

umn of mercury 76 cm. long or 15 pounds per square inch. The concentra-

tion of dissolved substances in blood serum is such that its osmotic pressure

is about 7 atmospheres.)))

SO LONG AS THERE WAS NO DELIMITATION

between the or-

ganic substance and its aqueous environment;

in other

words, so long as it was still dissolved

in the waters of the

original hydrosphere

of the Earth, the evolution of organic

substance

could be considered

only

its in

entirety.

But as

soon as organic substance became

concentrated

into coazervate droplets or bits of semi-liquid

as gels; as soon these droplets

became separated

colloidal
from the

surrounding medium

by a more or less definite border,

they at once acquired

a certain degree of individuality.

The future history of coazervate droplets

could now follow

different courses. Their fate was now dependent not only

on external

conditions

of the medium but also on their own

specific physico-chemical

structure or organization.

To be

able to trace the further

course of this evolution of organic

substances,

we Dlust first of all get a clear conception

of

the nature of this organization and of how this may affect

the velocity and direction

which he designated

as \"syn-

It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the complete

hope-

lessness of this oversimplified approach

to the solution of

the problem of the origin of life. is Just as it impossible

to

explain vital phenomena on the basis of the existence

of

some special chemical radicle so it is impossible to construct

a living organism

with the aid of osmotic forces alone. The

resemblance
is not greater

between Leduc's forms and living organisms than the external resemblance between a live

person

and his marble image, but no one seriously

believes

in Galatea's coming to life or in the visit of Pushkin's

\"Stone Guest\".

While Leduc

merely

indicated

the paths for synthesizing

organisms,

a number

of authors

of this

and claimed that

they had succeeded

in making living things by artificial

of the problem of the origin of life is concerned.

Their interest lies chiefly

in a simplified mechanical ap-

consisting of living cells which grow, divide and manifest other signs of life. This was obviously the work of a dilet-

tante who was not sufficiently familiar with colloidal sys-

tems *, and is, of course, devoid

of any real significance.

Still it can not be dismissed

as something casual or merely

as a curiosity.

To a certain extent it reflects

the crude

mechanistic views developed by Haeckel and his followers,

though perhaps in a highly exaggerated

form,

and could

only have originated from such conceptions

and theories.

Even Haeckel himself believed

that simple living things

could at one time have originated from inorganic matter

very much

in the manner of a crystal which

crystallizes

from

a solution.

All

was that

necessary

was some specific

but unknown force to bring

about this change from inanthing. Kuckuck searched for of radioactivity which at that

time were still very poorly understood.

Actually Haeckel had not advanced

beyond the naive

conceptions of primary

autogeneration,

except that he rele-

gated the event to the dim past, and for the \"vital force\" of

the vitalists he substituted

specific,

unusual

and unknown

external conditions. But just how these conditions and)

ious live or dead membranes

(fish bladder, capillary

wall, parchment,

collodion, cellophane,

etc.). They can be, therefore, separated from true

solutions by the use of such membranes. Starches, proteins, and many other

substances form colloidal sols. Substances in the colloidal

rather striking and peculiar

behavior, which constitutes the subject of a

forces have formed such extremely

complex

systems as are

represented even by the simplest living organisms remained

a dark mystery as much for Haeckel as for all subsequent

biologists.

The numerous

objections which the adherents of the

theory of the continuity of life raised against theories

which

assumed

that living organisms have been generated

at some

remote

period in the existence of our planet,

be-

come thus quite understandable, and can all be reduced

to

two points. The first was expressed

16

by Preyer

who re-

ferred with biting sarcasm to those mysterious

conditions

which were necessary for the appearance

of life in geolog-

ical epochs

of long ago and pointed out that no one seems

to understand what those conditions

really were. If the con-

ditions

were the same as prevail now, the origin

of life

would be plainly impossible

because,

as Pasteur's investi-

gations have shown,

this does not occur at the present

time.

On the other hand, if those conditions

were different,

the

generated organisms must have perished at once, because

the viability is confined to a very narrow range of varia-

tion in external conditions.

The other

objection

chev 17 in his popular

has been formulated

book: \"The

Appearance

S. by

Kosty-

of Life on

Earth\" (Russian, 1921). He argues

that even the most

simply organized living things possess a very complex, deli-

cate and perfect

protoplasmic

structure.

The various vital

processes are made possible

by this protoplasmic structure

and perfect

functional

differentiation.

The metabolism of

matter and energy

characteristic

for living things would be

entirely impossible and it is highly

without improbable

a specially adapted apparatus, that such a complex apparatus)))

60)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

could

arisen have

fortuitously.

If the reader were asked to

consider the probability

that in the midst of inorganic mat-

ter a large factory with smoke stacks,

pipes,

boilers,

ma-

chines, ventilators, etc. suddenly sprang

into existence

by

some natural process, let us say a volcanic

eruption,

this

would be taken at best for a silly joke. Yet, even the sim-

plest microorganism

has a more complex

structure

than any

factory, and therefore its fortuitous

creation

is very much

less probable.

These arguments

are of substantial

significance only if

we accept Haeckel's standpoint

and assume that at some

definite period in the Earth's

existence,

under the influence

of some physical forces and of some unknown conditions,

the living organism has originated

all at once from non-

living matter,

just as a crystal is formed in the mother

liquor. Even if this organism is the simplest

monera, never-

theless it must have been endowed with every attribute of

living matter,

i.e., its inner structure must have been

adapted

to carryon definite vital functions. But it is in the

highest degree improbable

that this adaptation,

this pur-

posefulness of inner structure

could result from the action

of some blind external physical force.

All these

difficulties,

however,

disappear

if we discard

once and for all the above mechanistic

conception and take

the standpoint

that the simplest living organisms originated

gradually by a long evolutionary

process of organic sub-

stance and that they represent merely definite

mileposts

along the general historic road of evolution

of matter. Then

the arguments of both Preyer and Kostychev lose their

force. Kostychev

commits

tion as the anti-Darwinists

to prove)))

LIFE AT SOME

61)

the impossibility

of natural development of higher organ-

isms possessing

many organs beautifully adapted to per-

form definite functions. Unquestionably, a factory could

never originate

through some natural phenomenon and in-

dependently

of man, simply because every factory

is con-

structed in accordance with some set, previously

worked

out plan. Everything in the factory,

beginning

with the erec-

tion of the building

and machinery down to the arrange-

ment of different sections, has been calculated

by the engi-

neer with a view to fulfill definite and foreseen aims. The

natural elements

could not accomplish such human objec-

tives or fulfill

a previously

laid-down plan.

It is inconceivable

that such a preconceived plan of proto-

plasmic structure

could exist unless one assumes a creative

divine

will and a plan of creation. But a definite protoplas-

mic organization and fitness of its inner structure to carry

out definite

functions

could easily be formed in the course

of evolution of organic matter just as highly organized ani-

mals and plants

have come from the simplest living things

by a process of evolution. Later we shall attempt

to trace

this evolution

to and

picture

the gradual formation of living

things from

non-living

matter. In this evolution more and

more

complex

phenomena

of a higher order became

super-

imposed upon the simplest physical and chemical proc-

esses; new properties developed ultimately resulting in the

emergence

of systems which are already subject

to biologi-

callaws.

From this standpoint it is easy to answer Preyer's ques-

tion: under what conditions

could life have appeared in

the past, and why does not this happen

now? We do not need

to invent

some special, unknown forces for this. The condi-)))

61)

THE ORIGIN

OF LIFE)

tions for the origin of living things are the same as the con-

ditions under which organic substance has been gradually

evolving. The first prerequisite condition was the primary

mass formation

of such organic substances.

It is absolutely

unthinkable that such complex

structures

like organisms

could have been ever generated

spontaneously,

directly

from carbon dioxide, water, oxygen,

nitrogen

and mineral

salts. The generation of living things must have been in-

evitably

preceded

by a primary development on the Earth's

surface of those organic substances of which the organisms

are constructed. Now, under natural conditions,

we do not

observe the formation of those substances which are formed

only secondarily by organisms

as a result of their 'Vital ac-

tivity. At one time the primary formation

of such organic

substances was deemed entirely impossible

but this view

has long since been discarded

under the impact of the bril-

liant successes

of organic chemistry. The chemist

succeeded

in synthesizing

in vitro, in his flasks and test tubes under

artificial conditions, practically all the known organic sub-

stances and, therefore, no one is any longer justified in

questioning
substances.

of a primary origin of these

We know well the nature of the conditions

under which these syntheses can be carried

out and we

need, therefore, only to prove or to disprove the possibility

of such primary

syntheses during remote periods of our

planet's

existence.

Another condition essential for the origin

of life is the

possibility of prolonged

transformations,

of prolonged evo-

lution of the primary organic substances. Organic substance

sequently, to accomplish

this transformation

from substance

to organism requires a very long time. At the present time

such a transformation

is entirely out of the question

be-

cause, if organic substance originated anywhere on the

Earth's

surface, it would be extremely rapidly devoured

and destroyed

by the countless microorganisms inhabiting

the soil, air and water. But before

life had yet appeared,

the Earth, of course, was entirely sterile and the organic

substances

which were formed could evolve in many differ-

ent directions

for a very long period

of time. However

strange this may seem at first sight, a sterile, life-less pe-

riod in the existence

of our planet was a necessary condi-

tion for the primary origin of life. This condition

prevailed

only in the remote past but does not exist now, since the

surface of the Earth is already thickly populated by innu-

merable highly organized living things.

To establish

the possibility for generation of life in the

dim past of the Earth's history, it is necessary

first of all to

the prove

possibility

of a primary formation of organic

substance

on our planet and, secondly, to trace the further

evolution of this substance. Contemporary science enables

us to furnish

a more or less definite

answer to both of these

problems.)))

CHAPTER IV)

PRIMARY

FORMS

NITROGEN

OF CARBON
COMPOUNDS)

AND

IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER it was shown

that the first

essential condition for the appearance

of life was the mass

formation

of organic substances on the Earth's surface.

Only in the presence

of such matter rich in internal chem-

ical energy and, therefore, capable of various transforma-

tions and changes could complex substances arise, out of

which the bodies of living organisms are made.

Neverthe-

less, most of the students of the problem of the origin of

life based their theories upon the assumption

that carbon

dioxide was the primary

carbon compound. They thought

that carbon

made its first appearance on the surface of the

Earth in its most completely oxidized

form,

incapable

of

further

chemical

transformation.

This proposition

was tac-

itly accepted as axiomatic but actually

it was entirely un.

founded. Many astronomical and geological

facts throw

serious

the doubt on

correctness

of this assumption.

To form some conception

of the primary forms of car-

hon compounds,

which originated on our planet, is it neces-

sary first of all to learn something pounds which are found on other

of those carbon com-
sidereal bodies. This will

allow us to approaoh

the the question of

transformations

of

carbon at the time the Earth was formed

of our planet.

hottest

stars, whose temperature

understood. Plaskett discovered

cipally, in the ionized state.

The next type, B, includes the bluish-white stars, in

whose

classes of this type, which have cooled off most. The pres-

metals and are very complex.

The spectrum

of the Sun, as

can be easily

understood,

has been studied in greatest

de-

tail, and we shall return to this subsequently.

The stars on the right side of the scheme have even lower

temperatures.

The types K and M, which belong

here, have

a surface temperature in the neighborhood

of 4,000\302\260 C.

The former is characterized by a very complex

spectrum

of

many metals. The hydrocarbon band G is very clearly

marked but the violet portion of the spectrum is somewhat

faded

out. The spectrum of type M abounds

in bands indi-

cating the appearance of a series of chemical compounds.

tion and emission spectra,

bands, occupy

a somewhat

distinct position.

Finally, the last two types Rand N are the dull red stars

with the lowest surface temperature,

which may apparently

drop as low as 1,800\302\260 C. This makes the study of these

sidereal bodies

rather difficult. Their spectra also abound

in absorption

bands, which indicate the presence of a num-

ber of chemical compounds, especially interesting among which are the carbon compounds, to which we shall refer

later.

This scheme of the spectra, which at first was established

empirically, has a very profound

physical

significance,

as

our investigations have shown,

because

it corresponds

ap-

proximately to the natural

sequence of thermal ionization,

is which

the physical

cause determining

the presence of

different

spectral

phenomena.

The stellar spectra are deter-

mined not only by the presence of this or that element in

the surface layer of these astral bodies but also by the

state of these elements and, especially, by the degree of

their ionization. Thus, the difference

in chemical composi-

tion of stars which

previously

seemed so abrupt, is now

explained

by the thermodynamic

environment of their sur-

face layers. For us the thing of real importance is the fact

that the spectral scheme reflects

the gradual

decrease in

the temperature of these astral bodies. On the left side of

the scheme

we find stars with the highest surface tempera-

tures, and these decrease gradually as we pass from the left

to the right side of the scheme. At the same time, this

sequence also reflects

to a certain extent the gradual evo-

lution of the star during the second

period of its existence,)))

For our purpose it is of interest to survey the appearance

of carbon in the different

spectral types of stars. It is im-

portant

to note first of all that this element has been noted

in almost all the enumerated

spectral types, save only the

S-stars. In the O-stars,

having the highest temperatures,

Plaskett discovered

that the carbon was chiefly in the mono-

and di-ionized

condition. The surface temperatures

here

are so high that any chemical combinations

of carbon are

out

the of

question,

and even the atom suffers material

alteration by losing its surface electrons (ionization).

In type B the next and much cooler

(20,000-15,000\302\260

C.)

Henroteau

and Henderson

4 have

already

found carbon in

the neutral state also, but even in this case no chemical

combinations

can yet exist. The first signs of such combi-

nation

appear

in the type A spectrum. In the latest (also

the coldest) subclasses of this type were first discovered

traces of the G band (\037 4314 Frauenhoffer's

spectrum), in-

dicating the possibility

of the appearance in such stars of

the primitive

carbon compounds, the hydrocarbons 5. In

the subsequent,

still colder subclasses of stars the hydro-

carbon bands appear more and more distinctly,

as the tem-

perature of the star's surface

falls, and reach the maximum

distinctness in the M and R classes. At the same time the

spectra of the F, G, K, M, Rand N stars reveal the cyano-

gen bands.

Of great interest also is the appearance

in the

same type of spectra of the so-called

Swan bands. They

can be seen in the spectrum of the Sun and especially of

the stars of the Nand R types 6. In former times these bands

were erroneously attributed

to carbon monoxide

(CO) but)))

more recently Patti, on the basis of a spectroscopic inves-

conclusion on the basis of the quantum theory, and thinks

mospheres, lays special emphasis on the absence from the

surface of the Sun, as well as of other stars, of any combi-

nations of carbon and oxygen,

and of CO in particular,

despite the fact that other oxides of metals (BO, AIO, TiO,

ZrO) and even HO are already easily

distinguishable.

He

says \"CO though often quoted

in the literature, has not yet

been

demonstrated

and its presence does not seem probable

even in the later types of stars. The supposition that it does

exist really resulted

from the erroneous interpretation of

the Swan spectrum,

which

actually

results from the mole-

cule C2.\"

We may now survey the different

forms of carbon com-

binations which are found on our own solar system. On the

Sun, which belongs to the G spectral type, carbon

is present

either as the molecule C2 or as the hydrocarbons (C + H) 8,

or finally as cyanogen (CN) 9. We shall discuss the analysis

of the solar spectrum

in greater detail later.

We must consider the comets as sidereal bodies which

emit light. A series of investigations

has been devoted to

the study
composition

of their spectra, but their nature and chemical has been clarified only in recent years. It is

becoming

more clearly established that comets belong

to

our solar system and that they apparently

have something

to do with the streams

of \"falling stars\" and meteorites.

Comets

seem to consist of cosmic dust, of hard particles

partly surrounded by a gaseous layer. Their luminosity

is

caused, principally, by electrical discharges in a very at-

tenuated

medium, but also, at least in part, by the heat gen-

erated upon the approach

of the Comet to the Sun. The gas

and dust particles,

which are thereby emitted, are thrown

back

by the pressure

exerted by the Sun's light,

the tail of the comet. Spectroscopic studies of the nucleus

and tail of comets reveal the sharp distinction

in the chem-

ical composition

to of both. This is easy

understand,

since

the nuclear spectrum to a certain extent

gives us a concep-

tion of those compounds

which first originated in the mate-

rial composing

the comet. On the contrary, the compounds

found

in the tail of the comet

result

secondarily

from

changes and chemical transformations

induced

by the ap-

proach of the comet to the Sun. These changes, of course,

must be fundamentally

different from those which the sub-

stances of the comet must have undergone

at the time of its

formation. In the nucleus

of the comet, as in the other sid-

ereal bodies, are found dicarbon

C2, cyanogen

and hydro-

carbons 10,but in the tail, beside

the dicarbon,

is it

possible

to demonstrate

definitely the presence of ionized carbon

monoxide

(CO+) also (Baldet) 11. Here we find, for the

first time, the combination of carbon with oxygen, but the

secondary character of this formation

in the tail of the

comet

is quite evident.

The study of the chemical composition

of the planets of

our solar system

is much more difficult. As is well known,

these celestial

bodies only reflect the Sun's light and this

alone complicates considerably their spectroscopic

analy-

sis. Be\037ides, it is necessary to bear in mind that many sub-

stances,

whose

presence

in the planetary atmosphere may

be assumed,

show no selective absorption in those regions

of the spectrum which are accessible

to our analysis as, for

instance, hydrogen,

nitrogen,

helium, neon and argon. Fur-

thermore,

the gases of the Earth's atmosphere absorb

a con-

siderable

part
