ABSTRACT: The swelling of dextran gels (Sephadex) in salt solutions with a water activity of 0.937, compared with the swelling in pure water, exhibited anion specificity as evidenced by an increased swelling ratio in the following order: Na2SO4 , H2O , NaCl , NaSCN. The swelling ratio showed a good linear correlation with the osmotic pressure of dextran (500 kD) in these solutions. The salt-concentration difference (imbalance) between the polymer-solution side of the membrane and the polymer-free permeate side during the osmotic-pressure measurements positively correlated with the effect of the salt on the polymer osmotic pressure. These phenomena conform to Hofmeister-type (or lyotropic) behavior. The diminishing augmentation of dextran osmotic pressure and the change in the salt-concentration imbalance with rising NaSCN concentration imply a positive preferential interaction and adsorption of the salt onto the polymer. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
The swelling and contraction of gels have important applications in many fields, such as controlled drug release, separation processes, and food processing. Yet, the reasons certain solutes cause the expansion of gels, whereas others cause shrinking, are still not fully understood, especially with regard to nonionic, hydrophilic polymers (NIHPs). Because of its growing importance, the topic of salt effects on gel swelling has been given considerable attention. This has mainly been with respect to polyelectrolyte gels,1–5 but also with respect to nonionic hydrogels. In the latter group,
studied gels range from hydrophobic polymers such as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPA),6–9 poly(vinylmethylether),10 and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA),11–13 to slightly hydrophobic ones such poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)14,15 and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP),16 to more hydrophilic, nonionic polymers such as poly(acrylamide) (PAAm)6,17,18 and dextran.2,19 The study of salt effects on such hydrophilic homopolymers sheds light on the role of the interactions between the various ions and hydrophilic groups (e.g., amide or hydroxyl) as part of the general effect of salts on polymers in aqueous solutions. Ion-specific effects, known as lyotropic or Hofmeister effects, of salts on macromolecules influence both charged and uncharged polymers.20 The classical Hofmeister series ranks salt ions according to their relative ability to precipitate and stabilize the native state of proteins or to

solubilize and denature them (salting-out and salting-in, respectively).21 These effects of salts on proteins22–28 and other polymers11,29 –31 have been investigated and reviewed extensively. It seems that all salts cause salting-out of hydrophobic groups on polymers, whereas hydrophilic groups may either be salted out or salted in to various degrees by different ions. An investigation of lyotropic salt effects on NIHPs may, therefore, substantiate this conception. Lyotropic salt effects are dominated by anion effects.21 They become significant at moderate concentrations and are approximately additive over all species in solution.21,32 A representative lyotropic series of anions is obtained, for example, by the time in which the following species elute from a column of G-10 Sephadex gel (epichlorohydrin-crosslinked dextran):21,33
SO422 , F2 , Cl2 , Br2 , I2 , SCN2
Because the driving force for gel swelling is the osmotic pressure of the polymer in the gel’s internal solution,6 a study of the effects of various salts on the osmotic pressure of polymers should be instructive. However, the effect of salts on the osmotic pressure of soluble NIHP has been scarcely studied. Some work has been done on the effect of salts on the osmotic pressure of PEO, a polymer of a slightly hydrophobic character.34,35 Further studies on the osmotic pressure of NIHPs in the presence of various salts may shed light on the mechanism by which salts affect the swelling of these polymer gels. This research had two main objectives. The first was to examine the hypothesis that salts affect the swelling of NIHP gels by changing the osmotic pressure of the polymer. The second objective was to explore the conjecture that anions are either preferentially bound to or rejected from NIHPs according to their lyotropic ranking and to study the relation between these preferential interactions and the effects of the salts on the polymer’s osmotic pressure and on the swelling of its gel. Dextran solutions and crosslinked dextran gels were used as model systems for NIHPs. The choice of salts for this study was aimed at an investigation of lyotropic effects. Because the dominant effects are those of the anions,21 we chose three salts whose anions form a distinct lyotropic series: SO4
22, a strong salting-out ion; Cl2, a mild salting-in ion; and SCN2, a strong salting-in ion. Na1, being a mild salting-out ion, was chosen as a common cation.
A better understanding of the behavior of NIHPs in aqueous salt solutions will be important for various applications of polymer solutions and gels.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
Model Polymer
Dextran Gel. Sephadex (G-75, 40 –120-mm beads, Pharmacia, Peapack, NJ) is an epichlorohydrincrosslinked dextran. It exists as different types with various levels of crosslinking. Their designations, G-10 to G-200, describe the amount of water absorbed by 10 g of dry gel beads.36 Sephadex is mainly used in size exclusion chromatography; however, single Sephadex beads have been used as osmometers for polymer solutions.37
Soluble Polymer. Dextran 509 kDa (D-5251 Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was used without further treatment. Dextran is a branched glucose polymer with a-136 glucosidic links in the backbone chain
and a-133 branching.36
Salts
The following salts were used: NaCl, Na2SO4 (Frutarom Ltd.), and NaSCN (Carlo Erba Reagenti, Italy). NaN3 at 0.02% was used as a preservative. All salts were analytically pure.
Methods
To compare lyotropic salt effects on gel swelling and on the osmotic pressure of the polymer, we chose an equal initial chemical potential of the water as a basis for comparison. For that purpose, we conducted the experiments with the different salts under initial conditions of equal water activity. Assuming that the polymer contribution to the lowering of the water activity is negligible compared to that of the salt, we made preliminary experiments to determine the dependence of the water activity on the concentration of the three salts (see the appendix).
Water-Activity Determination
The dependence of the water activity on the concentration of Na2SO4 and NaSCN was determined by the equilibration of small volumes of their solutions against NaCl solutions of known

water activities.38 This was done under isopiestic conditions in proximity equilibration cells39 at 25 6 1 °C for 4 weeks. Concentrations at equilibrium were determined by refractometry (Carl Zeiss model 73940 refractometer) based on pre-established calibration curves.
Determination of the Swelling Ratio of Microscopic Gel Beads
The projected areas of gel beads, both dry (Adry) and at equilibrium in water or salt solutions (Aeq), were measured with a light microscope (Olympus BH2) equipped with an Optronics 1-CCD digital video camera system followed by image analysis (NIH Image 1.60). If the beads are spherical, the swelling ratio can be evaluated as follows:
Veq/Vdry 5 (Aeq/Adry)3/2 (1)
where Veq and Vdry are the bead volumes in the swollen and dry states, respectively. Because individual beads were observed swelling, statistically significant results were obtainable with relatively small numbers of beads, typically 9 –12 beads per solution. Swelling equilibrium was reached within less than 8 min (using a modification of the method of ref. 40).
Solution Preparation
Doubly distilled water and dry materials (polymer, salts, etc.) were analytically weighed after the moisture content of the dry compounds was determined [dextran: by drying at 105 °C for 3 h, followed by cooling overnight in a desiccator with P2O5; salts: by drying at 110 °C under a vacuum (28.5 in. Hg) overnight, followed by cooling in a
P2O5 desiccator]. Solutions were stirred overnight at room temperature in sealed bottles for complete dissolution.
Osmotic-Pressure Determination
The experimental system for osmotic-pressure measurement (modified from Cohen et al.41 and Wachtel and Maroudas35) is shown in Figure 1. Dextran solutions of known polymer and salt concentrations were accurately weighed (60.01 g) in 50-mL Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells (model 8050) with Amicon-Millipore YM-10 regenerated cellulose membranes (molecular weight cut-off 10-kDa). The system was kept in a temperaturecontrolled room (25 6 1 °C). A manometrically measured constant nitrogen pressure was applied in increasing steps. The equilibration time for each step was about 48 h. The permeate was collected into vials containing a small amount of oil to prevent evaporation, and their weight was monitored continuously. When no change was recorded for at least 4 h, equilibrium was assumed to prevail. The equilibrium pressure and the weight of the accumulated permeate were then recorded. The partial specific volumes (mL/g) of the polymer (vp) and salts (vs) were measured at 25 °C by pycnometry. The polymer concentration (Cp; g/mL of solution) was calculated from the mass concentrations (g/g of solution) of the polymer (Gp) and salt (Gs) under the assumption of volume additivity, with the partial specific volume of water taken to be 1.00 mL/g:
Cp 5 Gp/[(1 2 Gs 2 Gp) 1 vsGs 1 vpGp] (2)
Determination of Salt Partition (Imbalance)
The concentration of the salt in the external solution was determined, for every equilibrium

step, by refractometry. The concentration of the salt inside the cell was calculated by mass balance. The equilibrium partitioning of the salt between the two sides of the membrane (impermeable to the polymer only) during the osmotic-pressure measurements was expressed in terms of the salt-concentration imbalance (I [ Cin 2 Cout) in molal units (mol of salt/kg of H2O) Cin and Cout represent the salt concentrations in the ploymer and permeate sides of the membrane, respectively.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The swelling ratio of Sephadex G-75 beads in water and several salt solutions is shown in Figure 2. It increased in the following order: Na2SO4 , H2O , NaCl , NaSCN. The effect of salts on the swelling ratio generally increased with salt concentration (decreasing water activity). These results agree with studies of solute effects on swelling of other NIHP gels, such as PAAm6,17,18 and PVP.16 Some work has also been done on the swelling of Sephadex in NaCl solutions.2,19 These results are also in general agreement with our data. Figure 3 describes the results of equilibrium osmotic-pressure measurements as a function of the concentration of dextran in solutions of NaCl, Na2SO4, and NaSCN and in pure water. The osmotic pressure of a polymer in a ternary solution
with two other diffusable species refers here to the pressure difference that needs to be applied to the ternary solution to equilibrate it with the polymer-free binary solution across a membrane impermeable to the polymer only. The initial concentrations of the salts were 1.93, 1.88, and 1.97 molal, respectively, all having a water activity of 0.937. The scaling exponents for the dextran osmotic pressure in these three salt solutions were 2.40 6 0.02, compared with 2.50 6 0.03 in pure water. These are somewhat higher than the theoretical value of 2.25 predicted for a semidilute polymer solution in a good solvent.42 Our results for dextran in pure water are in good agreement with the measurements reported by Vink,43 which can also be fit with a scaling exponent of 2.5. As shown in Figure 3, Na2SO4 reduced the osmotic pressure of dextran compared with that in pure water, whereas NaCl and NaSCN increased it (however, the increment obtained by NaCl is not statistically significant). In Figure 4, the swelling ratio of Sephadex beads in water and in salt solutions is plotted as a function of the osmotic pressure of the soluble polymer at a constant concentration (0.15 g of dextran/mL). A good linear correlation is observed, supporting the hypothesis that salts affect the swelling of an NIHP gel by changing the osmotic pressure of the polymer. The differences in the behavior of different ions in aqueous solutions can be related to their sur

face charge density.32 Small ions of high surface charge density bind water molecules strongly relative to the strength of water–water interactions in the bulk. Large monovalent ions of low surface charge density bind water molecules weakly relative to water–water interactions.32 This notion may help to explain the differences between the effects of the various salts on the osmotic pressure of dextran and the swelling of its gel. The mechanism for the reduced osmotic pressure of dextran in the Na2SO4 solution may be described in terms of the mixing free energy of the polymer in a Na2SO4 solution compared with that in pure water. This may be partly explained by entropic considerations: SO4
22, which has a high surface charge density,28 forms a complex of tightly bound water molecules around it. If we consider this complex as a solvent for the polymer, the entropy of mixing will be lower than with pure water. This is because the larger molecular size of the solvent decreases the number of degrees of freedom of the system. The mixing free energy of the Na2SO4 solution with the polymer is expected to be higher compared with that for pure water because of enthalpic considerations as well. As suggested by Takano et al.,16 the stability of the hydrogen bonds, between the lone-pair electrons of the hydroxyl oxygen and the water hy
drogens, may be modified by ions. High-chargedensity anions reduce the electron-pair acceptance44 ability of their adjacent water molecules, thus destabilizing their hydrogen bonds. The combination of these two considerations implies an increased mixing free energy and thus a lower osmotic pressure of the polymer. Contrary to the Na2SO4 solution, the NaSCN solution increased the osmotic pressure of dextran, which implies a lower mixing free energy compared with that for pure water. A clue for the mechanism of this effect of NaSCN may be drawn from the observation of Collins21,33 that the elution time of SCN2 on a Sephadex column was much longer than that of water. This suggested an apparent attraction between the SCN2 ion and the polymer, which was related to the low charge density of SCN2. Attraction and repulsion between salts and polymers may be described in terms of preferential interactions23,24 between the polymer and the two low molecular weight components of such a ternary system. Such preferential interactions form local gradients of salt concentration as a function of the distance from the polymer chains. To further investigate the interactions between the salts and the polymer, we measured the differences in the salt concentrations inside the cell, near the polymer, and

outside in the permeate. This difference, designated the salt-concentration imbalance, was determined at every equilibrium step during the osmotic-pressure measurements. The salt-concentration imbalance may serve as an effective tool in studying preferential interactions of a polymer with salts, but only when the chemical structure of the polymer is uniform enough. In the following discussion, we interpret a positive imbalance as an increased salt concentration in the vicinity of the polymer chains due to an adsorption process. In Figure 5, the concentration imbalance I (Cin 2 Cout), in molal units, of the salts NaCl, NaSCN, and Na2SO4 is plotted against the equilibrium concentration of dextran (g/mL). The concentration imbalance values are also ordered according to the lyotropic series. Because ions of high charge density, such as SO4
22, bind their first hydration shell very strongly, they are unable to approach the hydration layer of uncharged macromolecules.21 Na2SO4, which lowered the osmotic pressure of dextran, was preferentially rejected from the vicinity of the polymer. Garvey
and Rob45 suggested that SO4
5 caused salting-out of PVP due to entropic effects, that is, exclusion of ions from the vicinity of the polymer. In contrast to the sulfate, NaCl and especially NaSCN showed a higher concentration inside the cell, near the polymer. It is important to realize that even in a hypothetical situation where no interactions between the low molecular weight solute and the polymer exist, a negative imbalance is still expected for any solute whose partial molar volume is larger than that of water. This is because at equilibrium, the pressure on the polymer side is higher, and because (≠mi/≠P)T 5 Vi, where mi is the chemical potential and Vi is the molar volume of the diffusable species. The fact that the SCN2 ion, which is larger than a water molecule, tends to concentrate in the higher pressure compartment, near the polymer, suggests a positive preferential interaction between them. The effect of the NaSCN concentration on the dextran osmotic-pressure increment (DP) with respect to its osmotic pressure in pure water is depicted in Figure 6 at several dextran concentrations. DP increases with both salt and polymer

studied the imbalance of NaSCN at increasing concentrations. Figure 7 shows a rising imbalance with increasing NaSCN concentration.

Several authors have suggested that interaction of ions with an amide dipole46 or hydroxyl groups45 should lead to salting-in of the polymer. Karlstrom et al.29 suggested that large monovalent ions such as SCN2 bind to more hydrophobic polymers such as ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose or PEO and increase their polarity. The bound ions cause effective segment–segment repulsion, thus raising the solution’s cloud point. The adsorption of SCN2 and ClO4
2 to PHEMA was shown to be related to salting-in and gel swelling by Dusek et al.11 and Roorda et al.13 Song et al.47 measured anion binding constants to PVP by NMR and found a nearly lyotropic series order for the binding constants. According to Collins,32,33 ions of low charge density adsorb onto hydrophilic polymers, such as Sephadex, because in this way they free weakly bound hydration shell water molecules, both their own and those of the polymer, allowing them to form more favorable bulk water–water interactions. This may explain the adsorption of SCN2 onto dextran’s loosely hydrated surface of hydroxyl dipoles. It seems plausible that the most favorable binding site for such anions would be the hydroxyl hydrogen. We now propose an analysis of the measured imbalance of the NaSCN concentration with the
notion of ion adsorption mentioned previously. If we roughly assume that the concentration of free (unadsorbed) NaSCN inside the cell is approximately equal to the NaSCN concentration in the permeate, then the imbalance (I) is equal to the concentration of adsorbed NaSCN. Denoting the number of moles of NaSCN adsorbed per mole of glucose units in dextran as a and the maximal adsorption possible as A, we suggest a Langmuirtype sorption isotherm (see Fig. 8):
a 5 I/C9p 5 A 3 Cfs/(K 1 Cfs) (3)
where I (mol of adsorbed NaSCN/1000 g of H2O) and C9p (mol of glucose unit/1000 g of H2O) are the NaSCN molal imbalance and the dextranmonomer concentration, respectively; Cfs is the estimated free salt concentration, that is, the equilibrium salt concentration in the permeate (molal); and K is a constant. The binding constant (K21 in eq 3) was evaluated to be 1.33 molal21. From the asymptote value (A), it was estimated that at most only about one SCN2 ion is adsorbed per three glucose monomers of dextran (A 5 0.32 6 0.01). Thus, the number of hydroxyl groups is apparently not the limiting factor. This factor has yet to be revealed.

The idea that SCN2 ions preferentially adsorb to dextran can explain the increased osmotic pressure of dextran in solutions of this salt. This is due to a reduced free energy of mixing, which, in addition to the attractive interaction of the anions and hydroxyl groups, entails an increased combinatorial entropy of the counterions and their hydration water.
CONCLUSIONS
The swelling of dextran gel beads (Sephadex) in the studied salt solutions increased in the order of the lyotropic series: Na2SO4 , H2O , NaCl , NaSCN. Swelling increased with increasing NaCl and NaSCN concentrations but decreased with increasing Na2SO4 concentration. A similar pattern was found for the effect of these salts on the osmotic pressure of 500-kD dextran, supporting the hypothesis that the salts affect swelling by modifying the osmotic pressure of the polymer. The salt-concentration imbalance during osmotic-pressure measurements also followed the same trend: Na2SO4, which decreased the osmotic pressure of dextran with respect to water, exhibited an increasingly negative imbalance as the polymer became concentrated. NaCl showed a small positive imbalance, and NaSCN, on the other extreme, showed a rising positive imbalance with increasing dextran concentration. The NaSCN imbalance as a function of the total salt and polymer concentra
tions seemed to follow a Langmuir-type adsorption pattern, with an apparent binding constant of 1.33 molal21, and saturation at about one SCN2 ion per three glucose units. Our results suggest that salts, which tend to adsorb to an NIHP, will cause swelling of its gel by increasing its osmotic pressure, whereas repulsed salts will cause the opposite trend. The origin of the differences between effects of various anions can be related to their surface charge density, which affects their interactions with water molecules and the hydrophilic polymer groups. The increased osmotic pressure of dextran in solutions of NaSCN is explained by a reduced free energy of mixing due to both the attractive interaction of the anions with the polymer and the combinatorial entropy of their hydrated counterions. The polymer osmotic pressure and solute concentration imbalance may serve as important criteria for investigating interactions of salts with NIHP.

tions are plotted in Figure A1. They are in good agreement with literature values48 (average percentage deviations of 0.36 and 0.82, respectively). We calculated and used polynomial curve fits to determine the concentrations of equal water activity of the different salt solutions for the osmotic-pressure determinations.
