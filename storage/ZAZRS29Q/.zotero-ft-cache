Poly(styrene) microcapsules, prepared by depositing the polymer around emulsified aqueous droplets, were coated with a synthesized polyelectrolyte; i.e., copolymer of maleic acid (MA) with methyl vinyl ether (MVE), co
poly(MA, MVE), or with styrene (St), copoly(Ma, st).The permeability of the capsule membrane was investigated under various pHs of the outer medium using n-propyl alcohol as a permeant. It became apparent that either copoly(MA, St)- or copoly(MA, MVE)-coated microcapsules function as a pH-sensitive capsule. In particular, the former showed a dramatic change of the permeability in response to small differences in pH (5-6).By refer
ence to the viscometric and electrophoretic studies of both copolymers, these were interpreted as being due to a pH-induced alteration of the configuration of the copolymer coating on the surface of the capsule membrane. When sucrose was hydrolyzed in an aqueous suspension of the copoly(MA, St)-coated capsules into which invertase was loaded, the hydrolytic reaction was initiated at pH 5.5 and stopped at pH 4.5. Such initiationcessation control was repeated reversibly without damaging the capsules.
INTRODUCTION
Since microcapsules, including enzyme, were first prepared by Chang,’ many attempts have been made to microencapsulate aqueous solutions of enzyme within polymer membranes. Previously we tried microencapsulation of /3-amylase using pH-sensitive poly(styrene) (PSt) capsules with a surface coating of poly(iminoethylene).’ When maltotriose was hydrolyzed in an aqueous suspension of the enzyme-loaded capsules, the initiation and cessation of the enzyme reaction were reversibly regulated by pH changes in the outer medium (pH 5.5 +6.5 or vice versa). Thus, the use of pHsensitive capsules seemed to enable the preparation of a novel microencapsulated enzyme in which capsules function as a “bioreactor” having the ability to control enzymatic processes by an external stimulation such as pH changes. However, no further conclusion could be drawn because of the limited scope of the previous
work. A more extensive study of the permeation characteristics of polyelectrolyte-coated pH-sensitive capsules and their application to enzymatic reaction control is needed. Two copolymers of maleic acid (MA) with methyl vinyl ether (MVE), copoly(MA, MVE), and with styrene (St), copoly(MA, St), were synthesized in this study to use as a surface-coating in the preparations of pH-sensitive PSt microcapsules. The effect of pH on the permeability of the copolymer-coated capsules was investigated in detail, and discussed by considering the results obtained from the viscometric and electrophoretic studies of both copolymers. In an aqueous suspension of the invertase-loaded copolymercoated capsules at different pHs, the hydrolysis of sucrose was studied to evaluate the functional abilities of the obtained pH-sensitive capsules to control an enzymaticreaction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
PSt (weight-average molecular weight of 1.76 x lo5) was commercially obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Maleic anhydride (MAn) and St were also of commercial origin (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co.,
Japan). Invertase (grade V; activity was 40 * 10 units/mg when units were defined as pmoles sucrose hydrolyzed per minute at pH 4.5 and at 55°C) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from commercial sources.

Copoly(MA, St)
Copolymer of MAn with MVE, copoly(MAn, MVE), was the same sample as used in the previous study.3 The hydrolysis of copoly(MAn, MVE) was carried out in 1M NaOH at 40°C for 2 h under nitrogen. The hydrolysate was then dialyzed against distilled water for three days, passed through a column of Amberlite IR-l20B, lyophilized, and dried at 40°C for two days under reduced pressure. Copolymer of MAn with St, copoly(MAn,St), was synthesized by the radical copolymerization of an equimolar (0.5 mol) mixture of MAn and St in thiophene-free benzene (400 mL) with a , a'-azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator at 50°C for 4 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. A precipitate of the copolymer was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration, washed with benzene, purified by reprecipitation three times from a benzene/acetone system, and dried in V ~ C U Oat 40°C for three days. To obtain copoly(MA, St), the purified copoly(MAn, st) was hydrolyzed in the same manner as described above. The number-average molecular weight was 4.16 X lo5 for copoly(MA, MVE) and 2.60 x lo5for copoly(MA, St), as estimated by the usual osmometric method. The infrared spectra (KBr method) for both copolymers showed an absorption band (1720 cm-') which can be assigned to COOH. In addition, absorption bands due to ether groups (1200 and 1100 cm-') and to phenyl groups (1600 and 1490 cm-I) were observed in the spectra for copoly(MA, MVE) and copoly(MA, St), respectively. The results of the elemental analysis were: H, 5.83% and C, 47.19% for copoly(MA, MVE) and H, 5.58% and C, 64.82% for copoly(MA,St). These observed values were consistent with the values calculated from the following formulas: (C,H,,O,), (H, 5.80%; C, 48.30%) for copoly(MA, MVE) and (C12H,204)(mH, 5.49%; C, 65.45%) for copoly(MA, St).
Preparation of Microcapsules
Stable PSt microcapsules (mean diameter of 8.31 pm) with a semipermeable membrane were prepared by depositing the polymer around emulsified aqueous droplets via the following three procedures: 1) primary emulsification of an aqueous 20-mL solution of 4% (w/v) Triton X- 100 as an emulsifier in 40 mL of dichloromethane containing 8 g PSt with a homoblender for 5 min, 2) secondary emulsification of the obtained water/organic-type emulsion in an aqueous 600 mL solution containing 4% Tween 20 as an emulsifier under vigorous agitation for 10 min, and 3) complete removal of dichloromethane from the resulting (water/organic)/water-type complex emulsion according to the l i t e r a t ~ r eI.n~order to encapsulate the enzyme, the primary emulsification was carried out on 20 mL of 0.1M acetate buffer (pH 4) containing both 600 mg invertase and 800 mg Triton X-100. The obtained microcapsules were
collected by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with distilled water, and then subjected to the polymer coating procedure. The coating was made by stirring the obtained capsules (20 mL) in O.1M tartarate buffer (pH 3, 120 mL) containing the copolymer [0.005% (w/v) copoly(MA, MVE) or 0.05% (w/v) copoly(MA, St)] at room temperature for 10 h. It should be noted that variations in these coating conditions markedly affect the permeability of the capsules. The copolymer-coated capsules were then recovered by centrifugation, and purified by repeated washings with 0.1 M tartarate buffer (pH 3) until no copolymer was detected in the washing extracts as determined by colloid titration.' The amount of the copolymer coating was 0.16 pg/cm2 for copoly(MA, MVE) and 1.7 pg/cm2 for copoly(MA, St), as estimated from the amount of the copolymer remaining in the supernatant liquid.
Estimation of Permeability
The permeability was estimated by following the concentration changes of n-propyl alcohol (PA) as a permeant, after quick mixing of aqueous PA solution [50% (v/v), 3 mL] and capsule suspension [62 ? 5% (v/v), 30 mL], which were previously kept at the same temperature (25°C) and adjusted to the same pH (3-10) with O.1M acetate, phosphate, or carbonate buffer. The samples (0.1 mL) were separated from the suspension through a 0.1-pm filter at suitable time intervals, and analyzed with a Hitachi model 635A liquid chromatograph. The permeability constant, P, was calculated by the following equation:
c v, c,- cr
P = -2.303- log
CiAt C j - C,
which can be derived from Fick's first law of diffusion.6 Here, C, , C,, and C, are the initial, intermediary (at time t ) , and final concentrations of PA, respectively; V,,, is the total volume of microcapsules (16.47 cm3); and A is the total surface area of microcapsules (1.61 X lo4 cm2). The plot of log[(C, - C,)/(C, - C,)] vs. t showed a straight line throughout all the measurements. Typical examples of the obtained linear plot are represented in Figure 1.
Electrophoretic and Viscometric Measurements
The copolymer (1.5 g) was dissolved in 300 mL buffer solutions (acetate, pH < 6; phosphate, pH 6-8; carbonate, pH > 8) adjusted to ionic strength 0.1, and then dialyzed against the same buffer solution in a cellophane tube until the Donnan equilibrium was reached. The sample solutions, at different concentrations, were prepared by diluting the dialyzate with the buffer against which the polymer solution had been dialyzed. The electrophoretic mobility was measured at 25 ? 0.01"C with Hitachi Tiselius Electrophoresis Apparatus (model HTD-1). A microtype cell with a cross-sectional area of 0.1900 cm2 was used. The viscosity was measured at 25 t 0.005"C by using an Ubbelohde viscometer having a follow time of 304.5 s for water at 25°C. Both measurements were done at the poly

mer concentration range of 0.005 to 0.2 g/dL, and the obtained linear plots of the mobility or viscosity against the concentration were extrapolated to zero concentration as described previou~ly.~
Activity Determination and Enzymatic Reaction Control
The enzymatic activity of the copolymer-coated or uncoated capsules containing invertase was assayed by measuring the formation rate of reducing sugars (glucose plus
fructose) from sucrose. An aqueous suspension [27 * 3% (v/v), 25 mL] of the capsules including a total 200 mg of the enzyme was mixed with 20 mL of the substrate solution (0.1M acetate or phosphate buffer containing 200mM sucrose), then incubated at 25°C with continuous shaking. To determine the concentration of the reducing sugars formed, 0.5 mL of the sample, which was separated through a 0. I-pm filter at suitable time intervals, was analyzed according to the usual colorimetric method.’ The ability of the capsules to control the initiation and cessation of the enzyme reaction was tested by investigating batch reaction kinetics at pH 5.5 (where the reaction proceeds) and at pH 4.5 (where the reaction stops). The adjustment of pH (4.5 +5.5 or vice versa) was made by quick additions of a small amount of 2M HC1 or NaOH. The reproducibility of the initiation-cessation control was tested as follows: 1) incubation at pH 5.5 for 2 h; 2) further incubation at pH 4.5 for 2 h after quick adjustment of pH with HCl; 3) standing overnight (2°C) of the capsules which were taken out of the reaction system by centrifugation; and 4) repetition of the procedures 1-3.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of pH on Permeability of Copoly(MA, MVEI-coated Microcapsules

uncoated original capsules. In the case of the original capsule membrane, the P value was independent of pH and remained constant (1.59 x cm/s). In contrast, the P value of the coated capsules varied depending on pH; the curve displayed a gradual increase at pH 3-5, an inflection point at ca. pH 6, and a slight decrease at pH 7-10. It is thus found that the copolymer coating has the ability to control the permeation process by changing the ambient pH. This can be discussed by considering a pH-induced change in the configuration of the copolymer chain on the surface of the capsule membrane. It is very difficult to observe directly the configuration of polyelectrolyte ion which have been adsorbed onto the solid surface. However, a study on the conformation of polyion in an aqueous solution by means of viscometric measurement was useful for treating this subject, as demonstrated in our previous works.*,*In addition, an electrophoretic study was also available, because the conformation of polyion was remarkably influenced by its electric charge. The electrophoretic and viscometric measurements were thus carried out as a function of pH (see Fig. 3). To obtain

accurate information about the polyion charge from the mobility curve, one should first learn about the dissociational property of the polyion. We have reported that the potentiometric titration curve of copoly(MA, MVE) exhibited an inflection point around pH 6, when one-half of the copolymer-bound COOH groups was n e u t r a l i ~ e d .T~his means that two COOH groups in a MA unit dissociate independently in two stages, namely in the first dissociation stage (pH < 6) and in the second dissociation stage (pH > 6). Therefore, the variations in the mobility curve appeared in the pH regions below and above a plateau (near pH 6) can be assigned to the first and second dissociation stages of the COOH groups, respectively. The magnitude of increase in the mobility at pH < 6 is found to be larger than that at pH > 6. From this fact, it can be seen that in the first dissociation stage the copolymer ion carries a large portion of the negative charge. A slight decrease in the charge, observed in the second dissociation stage, seems to be attributable to a possible trapping’ of a counterion between two COO- ions in a MA unit. These alterations in the charge of the copolymer ion directly affect its conformation, since the mobility curve shows a striking resemblance to the viscosity curve. An increase in the charge via the dissociation of COOH thus leads to the expansion of the polyion chain which is indicated by a rise in the viscosity curve. Strong mutual repulsion between the copolymer-bound COO- ions seems to be the major cause. The similarity of the permeation curve in Figure 2 to the viscosity curve in Figure 3 suggests that the configuration change of the copolymer ion on the capsule surface can be understood by referring to the conformation change mentioned above. Therefore, the role of the copolymer coating in the permeation process is explicable as follows [see Fig. (4)]: 1) in the acidic pH range where the charge of the copolymer ion is fully eliminated, the capsule surface would be covered with a flat layer of the contracted and entangled copolymer chains to reduce the permeability; but 2) in the neutral or alkaline pH range where the copolymer ion carries a large amount of the charge, a possible expansion of the copolymer chains on the capsule surface would form a looped layer to enhance the permeability.

Effect of pH on Permeability of Copoly(MA, St)-coated Microcapsules
Figure 5 shows the curve of P vs. pH for copoly(MA, St)coated PSt microcapsules. The results obtained were found to have some similar features to that of the copoly(MA, MVE)coated capsules: a marked increase of P in the acidic pH region, the appearance of a plateau (or an inflection point) in the neutral pH region, and a slight decrease of P in the alkaline pH region. Thus, the permeability change of the copoly(MA, St)-coated capsules, as well as that of the copoly(MA, MVE)-coated capsules, can be explained as being due to a pH-induced alteration of the configuration of the copolymer coating on the capsule surface. However, the copoly(MA, St)-coated capsules showed a dramatic change in the permeability in the very narrow pH range (5.5 ? 0.5). This is distinctly different from the permeation characteristics of the copoly(MA, MVE)coated capsules and other polyelectrolyte-grafted capsules. lo Some authors'^".'* have reported that in an aqueous solution the conformation of copoly(MA, St) is affected not only by an electrical repulsion force between the COO- ions, but also by a hydrophobic force between the phenyl groups. When the hydrophobic force is overcome by the electrical force, a conformational transition from a tightly coiled chain to an extended one would occur as illustrated in Figure 6. This was supported by the fact that the viscosity curve reveals a rapid increase due to the drastic expansion of the copolymer chain in the pH 4-5 range where a slight increase in the polyion charge can be indicated by the mobility curve (see Fig. 7). Taking these results into account, the observed dramatic change in the permeability can be related to a pH-induced rapid alteration in the configuration of the copolymer coating; in other words, a quick transition from a flat layer consisting of tightly coiled chains [which reduces the permeability as shown in Fig. 4(a)] to a looped layer of expanded chains [which enhances the permeability as in Fig. 4(b)], in response to small differences in pH

Another important characteristic of the copoly(MA, St)coated capsules is that the ratio of the maximum (Pmatxo) minimum (F',,,,n)value in the permeation curve is larger than that of the copoly(MA, MVE)-coated capsules: 41(Pma,= 2.55 x cm/s at pH 8; Pmi,= 6.20 X cm/s at pH < 5 ) for copoly(MA, St)-coated capsules, and 8 (P,,,,, = 2.80 X cm/s at pH 7; Pmin= 3.50 X lo-' cm/s at pH 3) for copoly(MA, MVE)-coated capsules. This may be interpreted as such: There is a difference between both copolymers with regards to the level of surface covering. It appears likely that in the acidic pH range the surface of the capsules is covered more densely with copoly(MA, St) than with copoly(MA, MVE), because of a hydrophobic interaction between the phenyl groups attached to the copolymer chain and to the capsule surface.
Effect of pH on the Activity of Invertase-Loaded
Copolymer-Coated Microcapsules
In order to evaluate the abilities of both the copolymercoated microcapsules to regulate enzymatic processes, the
hydrolysis of sucrose was investigated as a function of pH in an aqueous suspension of the capsules into which invertase was loaded. Figure 8 depicts the pH-activity profiles of the enzyme-loaded, copolymer-coated capsules. Included in Figure 8 for comparison is the result of the ancoated original capsules containing the enzyme. The relative activity was then calculated on the basis of the formation rate of reducing sugars (glucose plus fructose) which was determined at pH 3.9 using the uncoated capsules. Utilizing the copoly(MA, St)-coated capsules, the activity was close to zero at pH < 4.5. However, a rapid increase in the activity was observed in the pH 5-6 range where the permeability of the capsules increased drastically (see Fig. 5). These results clearly indicate that in the range of pH < 6 the catalytic action of the encapsulated enzyme is governed by the permeability of the capsules. The essential pH effect on the activity of the native enzyme becomes a dominant factor at pH > 6, because of the agreement between the pH-activity curves of the enzymeloaded coated and uncoated capsules. In the acidic region, the copoly(MA, MVE)-coated capsules containing the enzyme exhibited lower activity than the uncoated ones, but a complete depression of the catalytic action was not achieved. This can be explained by considering the following permeation characteristics of the copoly(MA, MVE)-coated capsule membrane: 1) the permeability varies slowly in the pH 3-7 range (see Fig. 2 ) , and 2) the magnitude of variation in the permeability is considerably small, as characterized by the P,,,/P,,, ratio = 8 (see the previous section). From the results described above, it became apparent that, in order to use pH-sensitive microcapsules for regulating enzyme reactions, the first prerequisite is that they show a pronounced change in the permeability in response to small differences in pH. The copoly(MA, St)-coated capsules, as well as poly(imino-ethylene)-coated capsules reported already,' was found to satisfy such a requirement.

Initiation-Cessation Control of Invertase-catalyzed Hydrolysis of Sucrose Using Copoly(MA, St)Coated Microcapsules
In order to confirm the conclusion in the previous section, the initiation-cessation control of the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of sucrose was carried out by the use of the copoly(MA, St)-coated capsules including invertase. The results obtained are shown in Figure 9, together with those of the enzyme-loaded uncoated capsules which were employed as a control sample. Using the uncoated capsules, the encapsulated enzyme catalyzed the hydrolytic reaction not only at pH 5.5 but also at pH 4.5, to form both glucose and fructose. In contrast, when the copoly(MA, St)coated capsules were employed at pH 4.5, the catalytic action of the loaded enzyme was almost or entirely depressed (the concentration of the reducing sugars was less than 0.1 ,ug/mL), but the reaction was initiated by adjusting the pH of the outer medium to 5.5. Such initiation-cessation control could be repeated reversibly throughout a single run of the measurement. In addition, repeated measurements over 8 days gave excellent reproducibility without damaging the capsules (see Fig. 10).

As reported in this article, the microencapsulation of enzyme using pH-sensitive capsules, which is surface-coated with an appropriate polyelectrolyte, enables the control of enzymatic processes by small pH changes in the outer medium. This idea would be useful for raising the functional ability of microencapsulated enzyme.
