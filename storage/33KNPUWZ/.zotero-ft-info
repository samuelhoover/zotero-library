Title:          Protein­Ligand Docking in the Machine-Learning Era
Subject:        Molecular docking plays a significant role in early-stage drug discovery, from structure-based virtual screening (VS) to hit-to-lead optimization, and its capability and predictive power is critically dependent on the protein­ligand scoring function. In this review, we give a broad overview of recent scoring function development, as well as the docking-based applications in drug discovery. We outline the strategies and resources available for structure-based VS and discuss the assessment and development of classical and machine learning protein­ligand scoring functions. In particular, we highlight the recent progress of machine learning scoring function ranging from descriptor-based models to deep learning approaches. We also discuss the general workflow and docking protocols of structure-based VS, such as structure preparation, binding site detection, docking strategies, and post-docking filter/re-scoring, as well as a case study on the large-scale docking-based VS test on the LIT-PCBA data set.
