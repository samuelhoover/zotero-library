Materials design is a subtle balance between simplicity and complexity. Ideally, materials should be abundant, practical and processable. Stone, wood, metals, ceramics and plastics have been widely used in human techno logies through history, because they fulfil all of these criteria with their mechanical properties being impor tant selling points. However, with the recent emergence of nano , bio and global information technologies, the face of materials science has drastically evolved over the past decades. Modern materials need to exhibit increas ingly more sophisticated properties that cannot always be attained through rational design — at least up to now. Hence, other methods have to be developed to achieve complex functional matter. An efficient strategy used by nature to build complex living — or even thinking — matter is selforganization 1,2 (FIG. 1). Even the smallest examples of life, such as bacteria or archaea, are com plex systems, in which a large number of discrete mole cules interact in a crowded, confined environment. The behaviour of these collective systems is not predictable by simple mathematical laws and cannot be deduced from the properties of their individual components. Thus, understanding and mastering the principles that rule complex matter is crucial for the future development of materials science3. In this context, the objective of this Review is to discuss some of the steps needed for the elaboration of manmade complex soft matter. There is a particular emphasis on the primary and secondary structures of polymers, which are key components of a wide range of soft materials4, such as thermoplastic elastomers,
thermosets, blends, vitrimers, membranes, hydrogels and emulsions. It is noteworthy that the selforganization of complex chemical systems operates at different scales5. In biological organisms, the first level of control takes place at the molecular scale, in which macromolecules with precise tacticity, monomer sequences and topology, such as nucleic acids, proteins and polysaccharides, are synthesized by biocatalysts. At the nanoscale, polymer chains form defined functional aggregates through intramolecular folding and intermolecular non covalent association. The dynamic interactions of these individ ual components regulate genetic replication and lead to complex adaptive and evolutionary behaviours1,2. Manmade polymer materials are certainly not as complex as living matter because the chain of events leading from the molecular scale to the macroscale is much less controlled than in nature. Synthetic poly mers are more chemically diverse than biopolymers, thus increasing the possibilities of selforganization and making multiscale hierarchical behaviours difficult to predict. Perhaps more importantly, synthetic polymer chemistry does not offer the same level of molecular pre cision as biocatalysts such as enzymes and ribozymes. However, the field of polymer chemistry has developed dramatically during the past few decades, allowing for the synthesis of well defined macromolecules with con trolled composition, chain ends, chain lengths, molec ularweight distribution and topology 6 (FIG. 1). Beyond wellestablished commodity plastics and specialty poly mers used in advanced applications, a new class of ‘pre cision polymers’ with very sophisticated structures and

From precision polymers to complex materials and systems
Jean‐François Lutz1, Jean‐Marie Lehn2, E. W. Meijer3 and Krzysztof Matyjaszewski4
Abstract | Complex chemical systems, such as living biological matter, are highly organized structures based on discrete molecules in constant dynamic interactions. These natural materials can evolve and adapt to their environment. By contrast, man-made materials exhibit simpler properties. In this Review, we highlight that most of the necessary elements for the development of more complex synthetic matter are available today. Using modern strategies, such as controlled radical polymerizations, supramolecular polymerizations or stepwise synthesis, polymers with precisely controlled molecular structures can be synthesized. Moreover, such tailored polymers can be folded or self-assembled into defined nanoscale morphologies. These self-organized macromolecular objects can be at thermal equilibrium or can be driven out of equilibrium. Recently, in the latter case, interesting dynamic materials have been developed. However, this is just a start, and more complex adaptive materials are anticipated.

properties has recently emerged7,8. The advances that led to precision polymers probably began with the discovery of living polymers during the 1950s9. The subsequent development of other techniques, such as controlled radical polymerization methods7,10–13, dendrimer syn thesis14,15, iterative solid phase chemistry8,16 and supra molecular polymerizations17,18, has greatly broadened the scope of polymer synthesis. These modern tools and their advantages for controlling the microstructure and topology of synthetic macromolecules are described in the first three sections of this Review. The recent progress in polymer chemistry has not only facilitated the conception of organized soft matter, but has also opened up interesting new possibilities for the design of hybrid materials including organic–inor ganic hybrids and biohybrids. Nature uses a wide range of organic–inorganic composites for the construction of advanced biomaterials. Comparable bioinspired con structs are now attainable by working at the interface between inorganic, polymer and supramolecular chem istry19,20. In addition, various routes for linking covalently synthetic polymers to biopolymers, such as nucleic acids, small peptides and large functional proteins, have been reported21,22. In these strategies, precision is achieved by the contribution of both the synthetic and natural seg ments. Indeed, the structural and functional perfection of biological macromolecules can be exploited to build sophisticated biohybrid materials23,24. These aspects are discussed in the fourth section of this Review. In addition, important progress has been made during the past two
decades regarding the self assembly of synthetic macro molecules (FIG. 1). For example, the folding of synthetic single polymer chains is a topic of growing importance in the recent literature25–27. The self organization of macro molecular building blocks, such as block copolymers, in the solid state or in solution has also been widely studied in recent years28–30. These developments are analysed in the fifth section of the Review. As depicted in FIG. 1, polymer self organization may lead to materials that are at thermal equilibrium (that is, passive or static matter) or out of equilibrium (that is, active or dynamic matter)1. In the former situation, the complexity of self organization is only dependent on space, whereas in the latter case, spatial complexity may change through time. Dynamic polymer materials are probably the first important step towards man made complex systems. In recent years, the development of dynamic polymers (dynamers), assemblies and networks (FIG. 1) has opened promising new avenues for materials design31,32. These recent advances are described in the last section of this Review. Beyond reversible dynamic chemistry, the next step in materials science is likely to be the elaboration of adaptive synthetic matter (that is, materials that will adapt their physicochemical properties in response to external stimuli)2. Although these mate rials have not been fully achieved yet, recent progress in chemistry, physicochemistry and physics makes them foreseeable. All the pieces of the puzzle probably already exist but need to be assembled in an organized manner. In this context, we hope that the literature examples

emphasized in this Review will stimulate the creativity of researchers in the field and inspire the development of new strategies for the preparation of complex chemical systems. The polymer chemistry concepts presented here are also frequently used to arrive at more sophisticated polymer materials for electronic, energy and biomedical applications; however, these fields are not discussed and readers are referred to excellent recent reviews33–36.
Tools for precision polymer chemistry
The first prerequisite to achieve complex materials is that the molecular structure of the building blocks should be precisely controlled. Synthetic polymers are usually synthesized using two main mechanisms: step growth and chain growth polymerizations (FIG. 2). These approaches are straightforward and have been used since the early days of polymer science to pre pare commodity materials37. However, conventional step growth and chain growth mechanisms generally lead to polydisperse samples that are much less struc turally defined than biopolymers. To fill this gap, vari ous refined and optimized polymerization approaches have been introduced, starting with living anionic chain growth polymerizations9. In living polymeriza tions, all polymer chains grow in a uniform manner because propagation is slower than initiation, and side reactions, such as chain transfer and terminations, are suppressed. Living polymerizations allow the synthesis of well defined macromolecules with controlled chain lengths and a narrow molecular weight distribution,
and also provide fine control of molecular parameters, such as chain composition, end groups, topology and, in some cases, tacticity. In particular, this technique is very convenient for the synthesis of block copolymers38. However, anionic polymerizations require high purity reagents and demanding experimental conditions. More practical living polymerizations have been subsequently reported. The most significant milestone was probably the development of controlled radical polymerization (CRP) techniques, such as nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP)11, atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)7,10 and reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT)13. These polymerization procedures are easy to implement, tolerant to a wide range of chemical groups and allow the synthesis of tailor made macromolecules with con trolled molecular architectures39. As described in the two following sections, they permit the control of important molecular parameters, such as comonomer sequences40, and enable the preparation of polymers with highly com plex architectures39. Moreover, they can be used in the presence of inorganic19 and biological matter21,41 because of their tolerance to a range of functional groups. CRP techniques have been significantly optimized over the past few years. For example, the most recent ATRP procedures, such as activators regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET)42, initiators for continuous activator regeneration (ICAR)43, and supplemental acti vator and reducing agent (SARA)44, as well as externally controlled systems by light45 or electrical current46, can be

performed using very small amounts (ppm) of catalyst. It is also possible to carry out ATRP without transition metals47. In addition to anionic polymerizations and CRP, other convenient living chain growth methods have been developed. These include living cationic poly merization48,49, group transfer polymerization (GTP)50, ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP)51 and ring opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic esters and N carboxy anhydrides52,53. It has also been recently shown that supramolecular polymerizations may proceed via a controlled chain growth mechanism (BOX 1). It should be noted that some ROPs start with a chain growth mech anism but involve equilibrium adjustments of the chain during polymerization. Step growth approaches are convenient for the synthesis of some particular types of precision poly mers, such as periodic copolymers8. In addition to polymers prepared by a classical step growth mecha nism, such as polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates and polyurethanes, new step growth chemistries have been introduced in recent years (FIG. 2). These new approaches rely on reactions such as acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET)54, copper catalysed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition (CuAAC)55,56, radical addition57 and multi component Passerini or Ugi reactions58. It has also been shown that some particular bifunctional monomers may lead to a chain growth mechanism instead of the anticipated step growth polymerization59. This type of living polycondensation reaction creates interesting possibilities for the design of precision macromolecules, including electronically conducting polymers such as polythiophenes60. In addition to chain growth and step growth mech anisms, monodisperse polymers with precisely controlled microstructures can also be synthesized by multi step growth synthesis (FIG. 2). For example, convergent or divergent dendrimer synthesis allows the preparation of uniform globular macromolecules that are useful for a wide range of applications14,61. Although their synthesis involves stepwise chemical steps, such chemistries have been used to synthesize monodisperse dendrimers with molecular masses in the megadalton range62. A multi step synthesis approach can also be used for the synthe sis of monodisperse linear macromolecules8, in which protected monomers are usually attached one by one on a solid or soluble polymer support that facilitates
Box 1 | Supramolecular polymerizations
The development of supramolecular polymers has greatly broadened the possibilities of synthetic polymer chemistry18. In such polymers, the linkages between monomer units are non-covalent bonds of various types and strengths178. As a consequence, supramolecular polymers have dynamic backbones and could potentially exhibit adaptable and evolvable properties205. The first example of a supramolecular polymer was reported in 1990 using complementary uracil and 2,6-diacyl-amino-pyridine hydrogen-bond motifs206. Most of the described supramolecular polymers are based on hydrogen bonding178. For example, the self-complementary 2-ureidopyrimidinone motif is useful for preparing supramolecular polymers with material properties that were thought to only be possible with covalent macromolecules207,208. However, other non-covalent linkages can be used to this end, such as main-chain metal–ligand interactions209 and ion pairs210. In most cases, supramolecular polymerizations employ AB-complementary or AA-selfcomplementary monomers and therefore proceed via a step-growth mechanism (FIG. 2), which can be isodesmic or can involve ring–chain equilibrium17. However, some particular monomers polymerize via a chain-growth mechanism211, although their molecular structure would at first suggest a step-growth mechanism59. The figure above shows a recent example212, in which metastable corannulene monomers (M) are used. In low-polarity solvents, these monomers adopt a cage-like shape stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds and do not polymerize. However, in the presence of an initiator molecule (I) that contains only hydrogen-bond acceptor sites, M undergoes intermolecular associations and thus polymerizes via a chain-growth mechanism.

purification16,63. Although this process was initially developed for the synthesis of biopolymers (for example, peptides16), it has also been used for preparing synthetic sequence defined macromolecules64 and bioconjugates65. In particular, promising orthogonal approaches that do not require main chain protecting groups have been developed in recent years66–72.
Primary structure control
Microstructure (or primary structure in biochemistry) is a generic term that designates the molecular structure of a linear polymer chain and includes tacticity, regio chemistry, comonomer composition and monomer sequences. Controlling these parameters is crucial for the design of complex polymer materials. In nature, the pri mary structure determines protein folding and influences higher order self assembly behaviour73. Some precision polymerization tools described in the previous section permit the control of microstructure for synthetic poly mers7,8,74. Tacticity can be controlled in chain growth approaches, such as carbanionic or insertion poly merizations, as well as ROPs that use enantiopure mono mers52,75. For mechanistic reasons, radical polymerizations generally lead to the formation of atactic polymers; how ever, tacticity can be controlled in some CRPs using bulky monomers or coordinating additives76,77.
Comonomer composition and sequences are also very important parameters that influence the structure and properties of polymers8. Until very recently, there was still an important gap between simple man made copolymers, such as block, gradient, statistical, alternating and peri odic copolymers, and sequence defined biopolymers, such as proteins and nucleic acids, in which each mono mer is placed at a specific location78. However, efficient methods for controlling monomer sequences in synthetic polymers are now available8. As described in the previ ous section, step growth approaches are convenient for preparing polymers with periodic monomer sequences, but more diverse sequences can be obtained via chain growth polymerizations. For example, the ROP of large rings with the controlled positioning of functional groups can be used to control the sequence in linear polymers, as seen for chiral polyethylene oxides79. It is also possible to synthesize complex aperiodic sequences by the time controlled addition of reactive monomers in CRP80–82. Similarly, sequence controlled polymers with periodic or aperiodic microstructures have been recently synthesized by ROMP83–85. These developments have created inter esting new opportunities for the design of single chain folded objects86–88; however, polymers prepared by living chain growth polymerizations still exhibit chain length dispersity and chain to chain composition deviations89.

Monodisperse polymers with perfectly defined monomer sequences can be synthesized using other approaches, which can be bioinspired, such as DNA templated polymerizations90,91 and molecular catalytic machines92, or fully synthetic. In the latter case, some attempts have been made to decompose radical poly merizations to stepwise mono insertion approaches but with limited success93,94. However, sequence defined oligomers can be obtained by combining controlled radical oligomerization and purification by recycling size exclusion chromatography95. Other iterative chemistries seem promising for preparing uniform sequence defined polymers; for example, monodisperse periodic copolymers can be synthesized using divergent or convergent strategies96,97. Moreover, periodic monomer sequences can be prepared using solution98, liquid phase69 or solid phase iterative chem istry99,100. It was recently reported that monodisperse sequence defined poly(alkoxyamine amide)s can be synthesized using orthogonal coupling steps71. As shown in FIG. 3, these polymers can be used to store monomer coded digital information at the mole cular level. Information containing macromolecules constitute a new class of materials with promising applications in the fields of data storage and anti counterfeiting technologies101. Indeed, monomer coded sequences can be read using sequencing techniques102 and even erased under particular conditions71. In addi tion to these exciting new developments in information technologies, recent advances in monomer sequence control will generate interesting avenues for the elaboration of complex matter.
Control of macromolecular architecture
Beyond linear primary structures, architecture can be defined as the 3D structural shape of macromolecules. Nonlinear polymer architectures have an important role in the complex chain of events that takes place in bio logy. For example, cyclic DNA plasmids and branched proteoglycans are important materials with crucial biological functions. Following nature’s example, a wide range of complex nonlinear topologies, such as graft, star, dendritic, hyperbranched, brush and cyclic (co)polymers have been synthesized in recent years using precision polymerization tools. This topic is very broad and cannot be entirely covered in this Review. For comprehensive information, readers are guided to excellent recent reviews7,13,38,39. In brief, living chain growth polymerizations are probably the most studied and efficient approaches for controlling macromolecular architectures. For example, advanced topologies, such as multiblock copolymers38, miktoarm stars103 and cyclic or knotted macromolecules104, can be synthesized by anionic polymerization. Highly complex multicyclic topologies have also been prepared by living cationic polymerization105. However, CRP methods are the most convenient tools for controlling polymer architecture, albeit with slightly compromised precision39,106. As pre viously discussed, these techniques allow the synthesis of complex polymers using straightforward experimen tal conditions. In particular, CRP methods have greatly
facilitated the synthesis of block copolymers107 and, in particular, of complex multiblock copolymers108. As discussed in the fifth section, such novel archi tectures are promising building blocks for nanoscale self assembly109,110. In addition to block copolymers, a wide range of poly mer architectures can be obtained by CRP. For example, star polymers can be easily synthesized using arm first or core first methodologies111. Nonlinear architectures such as graft112, cyclic113 and hyperbranched polymers114 have also been prepared. CRP greatly facilitates the syn thesis of macromolecular brushes, a new class of high molecular weight polymers that can be easily imaged by atomic force microscopy115,116. These brushes can exhibit relatively complex structures and properties; for example, in FIG. 4, a dense macromolecular brush connected to a linear tail that contains protected 2 ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) hydrogen bonding moieties117 is shown. When the protecting groups are removed by light irradiation, the tail folds into a compact globule owing to UPy–UPy supramolecular associations — so called single chain polymer nanoparticles.
Preparation of hybrid materials
Modern polymer chemistry has led to the conception of hybrid materials that covalently associate synthetic macromolecules with inorganic or biological matter. Synthetic polymers can be combined with external ‘precision’ components: for example, with sequence defined functional biopolymers, such as nucleic acids and proteins, that have been optimized over billions of years of evolution24. The combination of organic and inorganic materials is also particularly important and is, for example, used by nature to integrate hard and soft tissues. The field of organic–inorganic composites is broad118,119 and the following discussion is limited to polymer based organic–inorganic materials. Inorganic matter can be associated with organic polymers at dif ferent scales. At the molecular scale, a wide range of inorganic polymers has been developed, which includes silicones, polysilazanes and polyphosphazenes. By using macromolecular engineering tools described in the first sections of this Review, these polymers can be connected to organic segments to form various hybrid segmented architectures. For example, polydimethylsiloxane based block copolymers are particularly relevant for cre ating self assembled bulk mesophases with very small patterns120 (see the following section). Metallopolymers, which contain main chain (BOX 1) or side chain metalligand linkages, are also a very useful class of materials121; for example, block architectures containing crystallizable polyferrocene segments are versatile building blocks for polymer self assembly122. At the nanoscale, a broad palette of organic–inorganic materials can be achieved19,123. Indeed, small and large inorganic nanoparticles (1D)19, planar surfaces (2D)124, concave and convex cylindrical structures, and inorganic networks (3D) have been functionalized by organic polymer chains20. Strategies for modifying silica, gold, metallic cobalt, titanium oxide and iron oxide surfaces have been widely studied125–128. Nanoparticles can also

be generated in unimolecular micelles such as star poly mers or molecular brushes129,130. Polymer chains can be non covalently adsorbed on inorganic surfaces131 and also covalently attached using grafting to, grafting through or grafting from strategies. In the last case, CRP techniques and, in particular, surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI ATRP)132 prove to be very versatile tools. Indeed, CRPs are tolerant to a wide range of functional groups and can therefore be performed in the presence of various inorganic mate rials. Among all CRP methods, SI ATRP is especially convenient because ATRP alkyl bromide initiators can
be easily anchored on inorganic surfaces. In fact, a wide range of functional ATRP initiators has been described in the literature133 and, therefore, SI ATRP can be per formed on most inorganic materials20. Consequently, tai lored surface coatings, including dense polymer brushes, can be easily prepared. The field of biohybrid polymers has also grown con siderably during the past ten years. Initially restricted to PEGylation technology, which is the modification of biological compounds with biocompatible poly ethylene glycol (PEG), this domain has now become much broader in scope21,134. A wide range of synthetic

This bottlebrush is covalently connected to a linear tail, which is a random copolymer of methyl methacrylate and a methacrylate derivative containing a protected 2-ureidopyrimidinone supramolecular motif. On removal of the protecting groups by light, the 2-ureidopyrimidinone motifs form associative hydrogen bonds and the linear tail compacts itself into a globular non-covalent aggregate. The two atomic force microscope images show a visualization of that phenomenon. Figure is adapted with permission from REF. 117, American Chemical Society.

polymers has been conjugated to biological matter; this includes neutral water soluble polymers, such as PEG or polyvinyl alcohol, polyelectrolytes, zwitter ionic polymers, hydrophobic bioinert polymers and stimuli responsive polymers, such as thermo or pH sensitive polymers135. The vast majority of polymer bioconjugation studies have been devoted to peptides and proteins24. In particular, numerous examples of the surface modification of transport proteins and enzymes have been reported in the literature22. These modifica tions can be achieved by connecting an initiator or a premade polymer to all amino acids of the same type (for example, lysine or cysteine), but they can also be site specific136. In all cases, it has been demonstrated that CRP methods are particularly suitable, because RAFT and ATRP techniques can be applied in physio logical conditions and used for the direct modification of proteins41,137. In addition to proteins, several exam ples of polysaccharide and nucleic acid conjugation have been reported138,139. In the latter case, the com bination of synthetic polymers with self sorting DNA strands enables the preparation of materials with pre cisely controlled morphologies140. Examples of poly mer modification of larger objects, such as viruses and blood cells, have also been reported, although such studies remain relatively rare21,141.
Self-organization of precision polymers
Macromolecular building blocks can spontaneously self organize into nanostructured materials. Self assembly processes can be regulated by different kinds of supramolecular driving forces — such as solvophobicity, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions or metal coordination — and can occur in the bulk, on flat sub strates, in confined environments or in dilute solutions. The basic principles of polymer self assembly are well known and are discussed in numerous reviews109,131,142–144. In contrast to molecular self assembly, polymer self organization generally relies on building blocks that do not have uniform molecular structures (that is, they exhibit chain length and composition dispersity). It has already been shown that dispersity has a significant effect on the morphologies of block copolymer mesophases and, in fact, may enrich the possibilities of polymer self assembly145. However, uniform macromolecular build ing blocks with precisely controlled microstructures and architectures are vital to achieving more complex self organized nanomaterials. The bulk self assembly of block copolymers is a topic that has been extensively studied for decades. For example, the phase diagram of diblock copolymers is well known, including nanosized spheres, cylinders, bicontinuous gyroid and lamellar morphologies142,146. However, even more complex morphologies can be obtained by self assembly of triblock147, tetrablock or higher multiblock copolymers110,148, but many of these possibilities have not yet been realised. Although the phase diagram of triblock copolymers is relatively well known147, the bulk self organization of tetrablocks is almost unexplored149. In addition, the use of nonlinear segmented building blocks increases the number of
attainable morphologies110. It was reported, for exam ple, that quasi crystal patterns can be obtained by self assembly of miktoarm stars150. Moreover, the chemi cal nature of the segments is a crucial parameter that influences the thermodynamic incompatibility between the blocks. For example, block copolymers containing segments that can crystallize151 or participate in supra molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding152 or metal–ligand interactions, exhibit very interesting self assembly behaviour. More recently, it was shown that the use of polydimethylsiloxane120 or polysac charide153 segments may lead to high χ (in which χ is the Flory–Huggins parameter) block copolymers that form organized mesophases with patterns below 10 nm (REF. 154). However, these materials require precisely controlled block sizes and would not be possible with out recent advances in polymer chemistry. In addition to block copolymer self assembly, precision polymer chem istry is also crucial for controlling solid state crystalline polymer morphologies155. The possibilities of polymer self assembly in solu tion have greatly advanced over recent years. Self organization may occur at the single chain level (that is, by intramolecular folding) or involve multiple chains with similar or different molecular structures (that is, intermolecular aggregation). Similar to biopolymers, synthetic polymer chains may fold into organized nanoobjects27: for example, oligomeric and polymeric foldamers25,26. Foldable macromolecules usually have stereoregular backbones with precisely controlled micro structures. However, atactic polymers synthesized by CRP or other methods can also be compacted into struc tured globules27,156,157. Chain compaction can be obtained by covalent crosslinking of randomly158 or precisely86 placed reactive units, or by using supramolecular ‘sticky’ motifs that promote intramolecular self assembly159–162. In the latter case, directional self organization can take place in a random polymer coil using helix forming supramolecular moieties163. These principles can be used to achieve functional nanoobjects such as artificial enzymes87. Moreover, by using stepwise orthogonal fold ing concepts, complex compartmentalized single chain nanoparticles can be formed88,164. Beyond single chain folding, intermolecular self assembly can also occur in dilute solutions using associat ing macromolecular building blocks, such as amphiphilic block copolymers, polysoaps and polyelectrolytes109,131,165. Amphiphilic diblock copolymers usually self assemble in water into classical morphologies, such as spherical micelles, vesicles166 and worm like micelles167. These morphologies can be obtained using preformed block copolymers but also via polymerization induced self assembly168. The concept of precision polymerization in controlling the solution morphology of block copolymers has already been demonstrated in 1995 with superamphi philes, in which the hydrophilic block comprised den drimers of different generations169. Generally, the solution morphology of block copolymers depends on the hydro philic and hydrophobic balance of the building blocks but is also influenced by the preparation process170,171. Moreover, unprecedented morphologies have been

attained using building blocks with more complex molec ular structures than diblocks; for example, multicompart ment micelles28,172, toroids173 and Janus particles174 can be obtained by solution self assembly of triblock copoly mers or miktoarm stars. Such self organized objects can also be used to build up higher hierarchical super structures that can include organic–inorganic hybrids and bioconjugates175,176. In FIG. 5a, examples of complex morphologies that are obtained by the stepwise assem bly of triblock copolymers are shown29. In this example, poly(styrene) b poly(butadiene) b poly(methyl meth acrylate) and poly(styrene) b poly(3 butenyl(dodecyl) sulfane) b poly(methyl methacrylate) block copolymers
were first individually self assembled into patchy parti cles containing monovalent or divalent sticky polystyrene patches. In a second step, these preformed particles were coassembled in a non solvent for polystyrene, thus result ing in the formation of complex compartmented worm like morphologies. Advanced polymer morphologies can also be obtained using crystallization as a main driving force instead of solvophobicity30,177. For example, the formation of triblock amphiphilic co micelles by crys tallization induced self assembly is shown in FIG. 5b. Overall, the two examples highlighted in FIG. 5 indicate that a high degree of complexity can now be reached in polymer self assembly.

Self-sorting, dynamic and adaptive materials
As shown in FIG. 1, self organized polymer materials can exist at thermal equilibrium or can be brought out of equilibrium1. In the latter case, the dynamic behav iour to restore thermal equilibrium can be the conse quence of either reversible supramolecular interactions or dynamic covalent bonds32. These dynamic properties can be exploited at different scales. At the molecular scale, dynamic interactions can be used to rearrange the molecular structure of synthetic macromolecules; for example, main chain supramolecular polymers exhibit dynamic backbone rearrangements178. Some details about this particular class of polymers can be found in BOX 1. Dynamic polymers — dynamers179 — involve monomer units that are linked together by dynamic covalent bonds. The formation of these revers ible bonds can result from exchange reactions, such as self contained reversible reactions in which the prod ucts contain all the atoms of the reactants, and non self contained reversible reactions that involve by product formation31. For example, Diels–Alder, hydrazone, imine, oxime, disulfide, trithiocarbonate, thiuram and alkoxyamine bonds have been widely studied for the synthesis of dynamers180–183. Although most of the reported examples of dynamers involve main chain equilibrium, some examples of side chain dynamers have also been reported184. Interestingly, the molecular structure of dynamers can adapt in response to environ mental changes such as variations in chemistry, pH or temperature180,185–187. Macromolecular components can also undergo dynamic interactions and exchanges at the nanoscale. For example, block copolymer aggregates in solution, such as micellar or vesicular assemblies (see previous section), are often dynamic. Similar to conventional surfactant assemblies, a dynamic equilibrium is established between unimers and aggregates. However, it should be noted that the critical micellar concentration, which is the poly mer concentration at which aggregation starts to occur, is usually much lower in block copolymer assemblies

This system is based on crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogels containing either β-cyclodextrin host moieties (β-CD host gel) or adamantane guest moieties (Ad guest gel). The mixing and shaking of equal amounts of cubes of β-CD host gel and Ad guest gel in water lead to programmed macroscopic self-assembly driven by CD–Ad reversible inclusion. The formed alternating hydrogel aggregate can be manipulated with tweezers and removed from water. b | Vitrimers are crosslinked polymer networks that contain dynamic covalent bonds.

As a consequence, the network can be shaped by heating, similar to silica glass, as shown in the photographs. Panel a is from REF. 196, Nature Publishing Group.

compared with low molecular weight surfactants. Furthermore, many block copolymer self assemblies are kinetically frozen because they involve glassy polymers170. Nevertheless, dynamic behaviour can be observed with macrosurfactants that have appropriate block lengths and composition188. In addition to solution phase self assembly, interesting dynamic and adaptive behaviours can also be obtained in self organized bulk mesophases189: for example, using block copolymers connected by non covalent linkages190,191. By using libraries of segments, bulk polymer properties can be adjusted to specific conditions and applications192. A wide range of macroscopic polymer materials with dynamic behaviours has also been introduced during the past decade. Many of them are based on crosslinked polymer networks involving supramo lecular interactions or dynamic covalent bonds193,194. Dynamic polymer chemistry has enabled the design of a broad palette of self healing materials. For exam ple, the preparation of interesting self healing rub bery materials using mixtures of oligomers containing hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites has been reported195. In FIG. 6a, an example of the self sorting behaviour of macroscopic hydrogel cubes196 is shown. In this work, covalently crosslinked acrylamide networks containing either β cyclodextrin or adamantyl moie ties were synthesized. The reversible β cyclodextrin –adamantyl host–guest interactions lead to macro scopic self organization. A large number of respon sive gels involving dynamic covalent bonds have been reported187,197–199, among which vitrimers constitute an intriguing new class of polymer materials200 (FIG. 6b). Vitrimers are covalently crosslinked polymer net works, in which exchange dynamic reactions, such as transesterification200 or transamination of vinylogous urethanes201, take place. As a consequence, these poly mer materials can be processed by heating like a silica glass, as shown in FIG. 6b. Apart from homogeneous networks, dynamic interactions allow the properties of bulk materials made of different components to be tuned, and interesting results have already been reported with polymer blends189 and composites202,203.
Outlook
In the past two decades, the face of polymer science has changed dramatically. Polymers are no longer envisioned as large scale commodity plastics but have become pre cision building blocks that undergo programmed self organization and enable the preparation of complex soft matter. This evolution is largely due to recent advances in synthetic polymer chemistry. As highlighted in this Review, precision tools that allow a fine degree of control over polymer microstructure and architecture are now available and have greatly broadened the scope of possi bilities in polymer synthesis. In addition, the field of pol ymer self assembly has significantly progressed over the past few years. The supramolecular behaviour of macro molecular building blocks is now relatively well under stood, and it is possible to predict simple self organized morphologies from macromolecular design. The next challenge in the field is to generate polymer based self organized objects that are of higher com plexity204. These morphologies may be attained by the coassembly of discrete building blocks27 or pre assembled particulates. Some examples in that direction have been described in this Review. However, these examples con stitute the forefront of the field and significant research has to be developed to transform these proof of principle studies into a mature science. Much can be learned from the field of molecular self assembly but also from mole cular biology3. Furthermore, recent progress in the field of dynamers indicates that out of equilibrium materials have a great potential in future materials science. For example, it is foreseeable that adaptive materials, which can modify their properties in response to specific appli cation conditions, will soon have an influence in human technologies. In particular, synthetic soft materials that can interact and ‘communicate’ with inorganic or bio logical matter are of great relevance for a wide range of applications. The twentieth century has delivered a broad palette of large scale commodity materials with simple structure–property relationships. The twenty first cen tury will be the age of responsive and adaptable complex matter, with a growing interest in man made materials that are out of equilibrium.
