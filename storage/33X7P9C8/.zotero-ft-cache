We develop a theory for the experimentally observed formation of multiple quantum dots (QDs) in strained-layer heteroepitaxy based on surface morphological stability analysis of a coherently strained epitaxial thin film on a crystalline substrate. Using a fully nonlinear model of surface morphological evolution that accounts for a wetting potential contribution to the epitaxial film‚Äôs free energy as well as surface diffusional anisotropy, we demonstrate the formation of multiple QD patterns in self-consistent dynamical simulations of the evolution of the epitaxial film surface perturbed from its planar state. The simulation predictions are supported by weakly nonlinear analysis of the epitaxial film surface morphological stability. We find that, in addition to the StranskiKrastanow instability, long-wavelength perturbations from the planar film surface morphology can trigger a nonlinear instability, resulting in the splitting of a single QD into multiple QDs of smaller sizes, and predict the critical wavelength of the film surface perturbation for the onset of the nonlinear tip-splitting instability. The theory provides a fundamental interpretation for the observations of ‚ÄúQD pairs‚Äù or ‚Äúdouble QDs‚Äù and other multiple QDs reported in experimental studies of epitaxial growth of semiconductor strained layers and sets the stage for precise engineering of tunable-size nanoscale surface features in strained-layer heteroepitaxy by exploiting film surface nonlinear, pattern forming phenomena.

Quantum dots (QDs) are three-dimensional (3D) crystalline structures of nanoscale size that exhibit quantum confinement and have a broad range of applications in the fabrication of electronic, optoelectronic, and photovoltaic devices.1 Controlling the size of QDs is used to tailor their electronic structure and has a direct impact on their optoelectronic properties.2 A common approach to QD growth is through the Stranski-Krastanow (SK) instability of the epitaxial film surface morphology in strained-layer heteroepitaxy, resulting in a growth transition, from layer-by-layer epitaxy to formation of 3D islands.3 Experimental studies have reported the formation of intriguing, complex QD morphologies, such as the ‚Äúdumbbellshaped QDs‚Äù observed in the growth of InSb layers on GaSb substrates,4 the ‚Äúmultiple QDs‚Äù grown in the InSb/GaAs and InSb:N/InAs systems,5 and the ‚ÄúQD pairs‚Äù formed in the epitaxy of InAs on GaAs substrates for both patterned and unpatterned GaAs substrate surfaces.6 In all of these cases, the formed QDs are characterized by split tips of variable height. This interesting pattern forming phenomenon can be exploited to control the size of QDs grown by strained-layer heteroepitaxy; however, a fundamental understanding of the phenomenon is required to enable the precise control of QD size. Similar surface tip splitting phenomena have been reported in recent theoretical studies of the surface morphological evolution of uniaxially stressed elastic solids and have been attributed to nonlinear instabilities undergone by the solid surface morphology accompanying the well-known Asaro-Tiller or Grinfeld instability.7,8 The purpose of this Letter is to develop a theory that describes and explains the multiple quantum dot pattern forming phenomenon in strained-layer epitaxy. Using a fully
nonlinear model for the surface morphological evolution of a coherently strained epitaxial film, we explain the formation of multiple QD patterns on the film surface as a result of a nonlinear long-wavelength tip-splitting instability predicted by a weakly nonlinear stability analysis of the epitaxial film surface morphology that accompanies the SK instability. The predictions of the stability theory are validated by self-consistent dynamical simulations of the surface morphological evolution, which demonstrate the formation of multiple quantum dot patterns and explain their experimental observation in epitaxial growth on both patterned and unpatterned substrates. We consider a coherently strained epitaxial thin film on a thick substrate, with a nominal film thickness of h0, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The film is subject to an equibiaxial stress, with components rxx 1‚ÅÑ4 ryy 1‚ÅÑ4 r0 in the x- and y-direction,

To calculate the onset of multiple QD formation, we adopt the ansatz of Ref. 8: All the sub-harmonics (with wave numbers nk) of the initial plane-wave perturbation (with wave number k) are excited and evolve independently with the growth rate of Eq.

We validate the conclusions of the weakly nonlinear stability theory using self-consistent dynamical simulations. We use a spectral collocation method where the film surface is discretized into 128 128 grid points. Discrete Fast Fourier Transform is used to calculate the stress and strain tensors at every point on the film surface12 and an additive semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method14 is employed with adaptive time step size for the integration of Eq. (1). In the simulations, we apply either a specified initial perturbation, consisting of a superposition of two plane waves resembling a regular square pattern of surface mounds, as shown in Fig. 2(a1), or a completely random initial perturbation, as shown in Fig. 2(b1). In the initial perturbation of Fig. 2(a1), kx 1‚ÅÑ4 ky 1‚ÅÑ4 0:70 < ks;c 1‚ÅÑ4 0:905. According to the weakly nonlinear theory, a tip-splitting instability will occur in both the x- and y-directions, and a multiple QD consisting of four smaller-size QDs is expected to form for each low-amplitude ‚Äúmound‚Äù of the original perturbation. At t 1‚ÅÑ4 0.58, Fig. 2(a2), the shape of the mound is not symmetric anymore with respect to the z-axis. This asymmetry is caused by the surface diffusional anisotropy. The height profile in the inset in Fig. 2(a2) shows that the amplitude of the perturbation has grown and each mound in the pattern is taller. At t 1‚ÅÑ4 0.84, Fig. 2(a3), it is evident that the mounds keep growing and the valleys in the film surface morphology become deeper. Most importantly, mound tip splitting has been initiated, and four new tips have now formed per each original mound. The tip splitting is particularly clear in the profile in the inset in Fig. 2(a3). Due to surface diffusional anisotropy, the newly formed tips are asymmetrically arranged within each mound. However, in simulations where the surface diffusional anisotropy is not accounted for, the observed tip splitting is symmetric resulting in a multiple QD that is a cluster of four symmetrically arranged QDs of equal height. The profile in the inset in Fig. 2(a3) resembles strongly the experimentally observed ‚Äúdouble QDs.‚Äù5,13 At t 1‚ÅÑ4 1.00,
Fig. 2(a4), the valleys between the smaller-size QDs in each multiple QD become deeper and the smaller-size QDs become more distinct having grown taller while retaining different heights. Eventually, the shorter small-size QDs gradually catch up with the taller ones within each original mound, and QD coarsening processes also become operative and determine the final, steady-state surface morphology shown in Ref. 13. The evolution of the thin film morphology in our simulation with the specified initial perturbation, Figs. 2(a1)‚Äì2(a4), is very similar to the experimental observations made in the growth of an InAs film on the surface of a GaAs substrate patterned with embedded InAs QDs, where ‚ÄúQD pairs‚Äù form at sites arranged exactly like the pattern of the embedded InAs QDs, facilitating the lateral replication of single QDs into QD pairs.6 The strain field developed by the embedded InAs QDs induces a long-wavelength perturbation on the grown InAs film surface with the wave number k determined by the lattice parameter of the embedded QD pattern. As a result, large-size QDs are allowed to form, which, according to our theory, undergo tip splitting for k < ks,c resulting in the formation of the pattern of ‚ÄúQD pairs‚Äù observed in Ref. 6. Representative results from simulations starting with a random initial perturbation, Fig. 2(b1), from the planar surface morphology are shown in Figs. 2(b1)‚Äì2(b4). The formation of QDs in the film surface is evident, Fig. 2(b2), leading to a pattern of multiple QDs as shown in Figs. 2(b3) and 2(b4); the connectivity of these multiple QDs in the form of a QD cluster is clear both in the 2D contour maps of Figs. 2(b3) and 2(b4) and the surface height profiles in the respective insets. However, in contrast to the multiple QD patterns of Figs. 2(a3) and 2(a4), these QD clusters are not identical to each other and they are not arranged in a regular pattern but a random one. Moreover, the total number of QDs formed in Figs. 2(b3) and 2(b4) is lower than that

formed in Figs. 2(a3) and 2(a4), respectively, for the same film surface area. These computed film surface patterns are consistent with the experimental observations6 that multiple QDs of InAs are formed on both patterned and unpatterned GaAs surfaces, but the multiple QDs formed on unpatterned GaAs surfaces are randomly arranged and fewer per unit area than those formed on patterned GaAs surfaces. After a sufficiently long evolution period, the epitaxial film surfaces in both simulation types reach the same stable steady state, characterized by a regular pattern of equal-size QDs arranged in a hexagonal lattice.13 Nevertheless, as the film surface morphology evolves toward its steady state, various multiple QD patterns develop, such as those shown in Fig. 2. These patterns can be frozen, i.e., trapped kinetically, in the film surface by lowering the substrate temperature and diminishing the rate of diffusional transport. ‚ÄúDouble QDs,‚Äù ‚Äútriple QDs,‚Äù5 ‚Äúquadruple QDs,‚Äù5 and even ‚Äú6-fold QDs‚Äù6 have been observed in experiments. Our theory can predict the number of smaller-size QDs in a multiple QD that forms. For specified initial perturbations such as that shown in Fig. 2(a1), the predictions of Eq. (7) for the number, n, of smaller-size QDs in a multiple QD is plotted in Fig. 3(a) for the parameter set that gave the results of Fig. 2 as a function of the wavelengths of the perturbation scaled by the corresponding maximally unstable wavelength kmax. To validate these predictions, we conduct a systematic protocol of hundreds of surface morphological evolution simulations, with initial perturbation wavelengths kx and ky sampled evenly over the entire domain of Fig. 3(a). The simulation results in Fig. 3(b) are in good qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with the theoretical results of Fig. 3(a). The critical wave number predicted by the simulations is ks,c 1‚ÅÑ4 0.80, in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction of ks,c  0.91. According to our theory, the formation of a multiple QD with a large number n of distinct smaller-size QDs requires longer-wavelength perturbations that will result in larger-size initial QDs. Such QDs are difficult to grow on unpatterned substrate surfaces, since tip splitting will be triggered when the QD size is sufficiently large, and double QDs will form preventing the continuous growth of the original QD size. This explains why, in the experiments, multiple QDs, i.e., large QD clusters with n > 2 are
much less commonly observed than double QDs (n 1‚ÅÑ4 2), but they are easier to form on patterned substrates. In summary, we studied the morphological stability of a coherently strained epitaxial thin film using weakly nonlinear analysis and self-consistent dynamical simulations based on a fully nonlinear model of surface morphological evolution that accounts for the stress state of the film, the wetting potential, and surface diffusional anisotropy. We found that long-wavelength perturbations from the planar film surface morphology can trigger a nonlinear instability that leads to the tip splitting of a single epitaxial QD, which grows as a result of the Stranski-Krastanow instability, and the formation of multiple QDs in the form of a QD cluster consisting of several closely located smaller-sized QDs with individual tips of variable height. The nonlinear instability occurs independent of the film surface diffusional anisotropy, which affects only the resulting QD morphology through an asymmetric splitting of the originally formed QD. Our theory provides a fundamental interpretation to numerous experimental observations of multiple quantum dot formation in strainedlayer heteroepitaxy on both patterned and unpatterned substrates. Our findings also suggest that nonlinear surface phenomena in strained-layer heteroepitaxy can be exploited for precise engineering of tunable-size nanoscale surface features, resulting in tailored material properties toward optimal optoelectronic function.
