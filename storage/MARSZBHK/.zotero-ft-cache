ABSTRACT: Equilibrium phase diagrams are calculated for a selection of two-component block copolymer architectures using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). The topology of the phase diagrams is relatively unaffected by differences in architecture, but the phase boundaries shift significantly in composition. The shifts are consistent with the decomposition of architectures into constituent units as proposed by Gido and co-workers, but there are significant quantitative deviations from this principle in the intermediatesegregation regime. Although the complex phase windows continue to be dominated by the gyroid (G) phase, the regions of the newly discovered Fddd (O70) phase become appreciable for certain architectures and the perforated-lamellar (PL) phase becomes stable when the complex phase windows shift toward high compositional asymmetry.

INTRODUCTION
The phase behavior of AB diblock copolymer melts has been
well studied experimentally,1 and self-consistent field theory
(SCFT)2 has been remarkably successful in explaining the
equilibrium phase behavior.3−5 Vavasour and Whitmore6 produced the first SCFT phase diagram, but it was limited to the classical lamellar (L), cylindrical (C), and bcc spherical (S)
phases. Matsen and Schick7 then extended it to include complex phases, predicting the gyroid (G) phase to be more stable than the perforated-lamellar (PL) phase as confirmed
later by experiment.8 In a subsequent calculation by Matsen
and Bates,9 a narrow closed-packed spherical (Scp) phase was
predicted along the order−disorder transition (ODT), which has since been associated with a region of densely packed
spherical micelles.10,11 Most recently, the Fddd (O70) phase was
predicted by Tyler and Morse12 and later observed in
experiment.13−15 Figure 1 shows the current up-to-date SCFT phase diagram for AB diblock copolymer melts. The AB diblock is just the simplest block copolymer among an unlimited variety of different architectures. It is natural to ask how the phase behavior changes for other architectures, but this has proven to be a daunting task as soon as a third chemically distinct component is involved; in fact, even the simple linear ABC triblock exhibits so many morphologies that
we might never catalogue them all.16 Nevertheless, the phase behavior appears manageable for those architectures comprised of just two segment types. Among this class of architectures, the
ABA triblock is the next most studied block copolymer,17 mainly because of its commercial use as a thermoplastic elastomer. There were also a considerable number of early experiments on star block copolymers, formed by joining three
or more diblocks together by their ends.18−20 More recently,
though, experiments have focused on miktoarm stars21−26 and
various graft architectures.27−30 The theoretical work on ABtype architectures is starting to catchup with experiment; SCFT
phase diagrams now exist for ABA triblocks,31,32 linear ABAB...
multiblocks,33 diblock-arm stars,34 triblock-arm stars,35 various miktoarm stars,35,36 branched diblocks,37,38 and multigraft combs.39 The general conclusion from these studies is that all AB-type architectures have similar phase diagrams, but with significantly shifted phase boundaries. The reason for the similarity is fairly well understood. Although mechanical properties are completely altered by snipping the middle B blocks of an ABA triblock melt in half, the free energy is relatively unaffected, and thus its equilibrium phase diagram remains much the same as that of an AB diblock copolymer melt.31 The same rational applies to linear ABAB.. multiblocks, and likewise the phase

behavior of diblock-arm stars should be reasonably unaffected
by uncoupling their arms. Gido and co-workers27−29 have taken this idea one step further, decomposing multigraft block copolymers into constituent AmBn miktoarm stars and mapping
them on to a phase diagram calculated by Milner40 using the
strong-stretching theory (SST) of Semenov,41 which is the
infinite-segregation limit of SCFT.42 This has been successful in explaining the compositional shift in the phase boundaries. The effect of architecture on complex phase behavior is less well understood. Experiments are far too time-consuming to thoroughly address this issue, while theoretical calculations have been computationally costly. Consequently, SCFT calculations for the complex phases have been restricted to relatively weak segregations, often with some of the potential phases omitted from consideration. The Fddd morphology has never been considered largely because it was not even discovered at the time of most calculations, and similarly many previous studies where not aware of alternatives to the bcc packing of spheres. We now know of other potential arrangements such as close-packed spheres (fcc or hcp) as well
as an A15 packing predicted by Grason and Kamien36 for ABn
miktoarm stars and later confirmed in experiment.43 Fortunately, there have been a number of recent numerical
advances44−46 that allow the complex phases to be readily examined up to high segregations. Therefore, we now revisit the ABA triblock, linear ABAB... multiblock, diblock-arm star, and AB2 miktoarm star architectures, updating their phase diagrams from all the known morphologies and mapping the complex phase windows to higher segregation. We also evaluate a new phase diagram for combs with a B-type backbone and Atype teeth, formed by stringing AB2 stars together, so as to further test if the phase behavior of multigraft block copolymers
is equivalent into that of their constituent units.
■
RESULTS
There are ample descriptions of the SCFT for complex
architectures in the existing literature,31−34,38,39 and so we forego any further repetition of the theory. It suffices to say that we perform standard calculations for incompressible melts using the standard Gaussian chain model with conformational
symmetry between the A and B segments.3 Our study considers five different architectures, where the constituent units are either the AB diblock or the AB2 miktoarm star. The relevant parameters are the number of segments per constituent unit, N, the standard Flory−Huggins interaction parameter, χ, and the volume fraction of the A component, f. After the AB diblock architecture, the symmetric ABA triblock, formed by joining two identical AB diblocks together by their B ends, is the most common block copolymer. Its phase diagram is shown in Figure 2, which extends the previous
calculation31 to show the gyroid (G) channel to much higher segregation and to include the Fddd (O70) morphology. Since the triblock is formed by joining two diblocks together, the phase diagram is expected to be similar to Figure 1 when N is defined as the half of the total polymerization, and indeed it is. Nevertheless, the phase boundaries are shifted somewhat and the symmetry about f = 0.5 is now broken. Interestingly, the stability regions of the O70 phase are about half again as large as those of the diblock copolymer melt, but the regions of the close-packed spherical (Scp) phase are somewhat narrower. Naturally, we can create ever larger linear multiblocks by joining more diblocks together by their equivalent ends. As the number of blocks increases, the system reaches an asymptotic
limit,47 previously investigated by Matsen and Schick.34 Figure 3 extends that calculation by plotting the complex phase
channel to far higher segregation and testing for the O70, Scp, and SA15 phases. As expected, the topology of the phase diagram remains equivalent to that of the diblock copolymer melt, since the multiblock architecture is just a string of diblocks joined together. In the limit of an infinite number of blocks, the phase diagram again becomes symmetric about f = 0.5. Continuing the trend from the diblock to the triblock, the multiblock architecture has slightly larger O70 regions and narrower Scp regions. Another way of joining diblocks together is by connecting, for example, the B-ends to form a diblock-arm star. This is
evidently the first system for which experiments18−20 observed a gyroid morphology, although it was mistakenly identified as a double-diamond morphology. This misassignment was corrected48 shortly after SCFT calculations34 predicted gyroid to be more stable than double-diamond. The SCFT calculations, however, only explored the complex phase channel at weak segregations and furthermore did not test for the O70, Scp, and SA15 phases. Figure 4 now provides a more complete phase diagram for 9-arm stars. Although the topology of the diagram remains equivalent to that of the diblock, there are particularly large shifts in the phase boundaries. Equally significant is the fact that the O70 regions are far bigger than those of the

previous architectures, while the Scp regions are particularly narrow. In general, the constituent units of AB-type architectures are AmBn miktoarm stars, where m arms are entirely composed of A
segments and n arms are made up of entirely B segments.27−29
Grason and Kamien36 have calculated phase diagrams for m = 1 with n = 2, 3, 4, and 5, but they did not consider the perforatedlamellar (PL) and Fddd (O70) phases. Therefore, we redo the calculation for the AB2 star, which is the simplest version beyond the trivial diblock where m = n = 1. The new phase diagram in Figure 5 exhibits a sizable O70 region on the large-f
side of the diagram, where the B-component forms the network and the A-component forms the matrix. More interestingly, however, is the emergence of a stable PL region on the same side of the phase diagram but at higher segregation. To the best of our knowledge, PL has only been previously predicted to be
stable for diblock/homopolymer blends49,50 and never for a neat block copolymer melt. It is also worth noting that the closed-packed spherical (Scp) regions are substantially larger than for the other architectures. By joining the AB2 miktoarm stars together in a series by their B ends, one obtains a comb block copolymer with a Btype backbone and A-type teeth. As our last example, Figure 6
plots the phase diagram of the comb architecture in the limit where it has an infinite number of teeth. The phase diagram for a finite number of teeth will naturally be intermediate to Figures 5 and 6. For the most part, stringing the stars together to form a comb has little effect on the phase diagram, but it does cause a substantial increase in the size of the complex O70 and PL regions. There is also a significant narrowing of the Scp regions, so much so that the one on the right vanishes for our range of segregations (i.e., χN ≤ 50).
■
DISCUSSION
According to SST, the free energy of a strongly segregated block copolymer melt should be relatively unaffected by snipping in half those blocks that have both ends constrained to the internal A/B interfaces. This leads to the hypothesis that complex architectures can be decomposed into constituent
units,27−29 implying that Figures 2−4 should closely resemble the AB diblock phase diagram in Figure 1, while Figure 6 should approximately match the AB2 star block phase diagram in Figure 5. This principle is vaguely accurate near χN ≈ 50 and must become exact in the infinite-segregation limit (i.e., χN →
∞).42 Nevertheless, there are significant deviations in the intermediate-segregation regime, and there are also considerable shifts in the order−disorder transition (ODT). The latter occurs simply because architectures composed of fewer units result in more free ends per unit volume, and end segments are able to escape their domains more easily than middle segments which promotes the disordered state. One might suspect that architecture could have a big effect on the complex phase behavior, since the free energy differences between the competing phases are relatively small. However, there is no dramatic change. The gyroid (G) phase continues to dominate the complex phase channel, and the newly discovered Fddd (O70) phase remains stable extending down to the mean-field critical point just as it does for diblock
copolymer melts.51 In the diblock copolymer system, the predicted O70 regions are rather small and thus prone to the
effect of fluctuations.52 However, O70 does evidently survive fluctuations given the fact that it has been identified by
experiments in diblock copolymer melts,13−15 although this
may have been aided by conformational asymmetry.46 Nevertheless, we can expect the O70 phase to be a common feature of AB-type block copolymer melts, given that its predicted stability regions are significantly larger for all the other

architectures we examined, particularly so for the star and comb block copolymers. As expected from the decomposition principle, the A15 spherical (SA15) phase occurs for combs (Figure 6) in the same
place that Grason and Kemien36 predicted it for AB2 miktoarm stars (Figure 5). Likewise, the perforated-lamellar (PL) phase occurs in the same region of both phase diagrams. Not surprisingly, its occurrence between the L and G morphologies is precisely where it is most metastable in the diblock phase diagram. Even the preferred version of the PL phase, where perforated layers pack in an abcabc... sequence, is the same as in
the diblock system.46 We suspect that PL becomes stable for the star and comb architectures because the complex phase window has been shifted toward high asymmetries, where the majority-component layers are particularly thick. It has been shown that the PL phase is only metastable in diblock copolymers because of packing frustration in its majority
component layers.53 This conclusion stems from the fact that PL can be stabilized with the addition of majority-component
homopolymer.49,50 Likewise, we attribute the stability of PL in Figures 5 and 6 to a reduction in packing frustration that results from the extra thickness of the majority-component layers. Just as in the diblock system, all the phase diagrams have triple points (denoted by diamond symbols) along the ODT beyond which there are narrow regions of the close-pack spherical (Scp) phase. Although it is missing from the right side of Figure 6 for the comb architecture, we expect that it does become stable at some point beyond the range of the plot. In all cases, the hcp symmetry was slightly more stable than the fcc packing of spheres as found earlier for the diblock
architecture.46 Although Grason et al.37,38 predict fcc regions along the ODT for number of different architectures, this is evidently because they did not consider the hcp arrangement. Interestingly, we observe a narrowing of the Scp regions for architectures with more units, which is relatively easy to explain. The Scp phase occurs when the minority-component blocks start pulling out of the spherical domains and swelling the matrix, which relieves the packing frustration responsible for the usual bcc arrangement of spheres. This happens more readily when the minority-component blocks have free ends, and thus the smaller AB diblock and AB2 star architectures have the larger Scp regions. Of course, there is still the possibility that a stable morphology is missing from our new phase diagrams. There
are screening methods54,55 that could be used to search for new phases, but it is unclear how effective they are at capturing all the stable phases. So far, the known phases for AB-type block copolymer melts have been found by experimental observation. Even the discovery of the Fddd phase in the diblock copolymer
system, which was predicted by SCFT12 two years before it was
experimentally identified,13 is ultimately accredited to experiment. It was only realized as a potential candidate structure after an analogous phase was experimentally identified in ABC
triblock copolymer melts.56 Similarly, the A15 spherical phase
was observed in lyotropic liquid crystals,57 before being considered as a candidate structure for block copolymers. Our current calculations were made possible by recent numerical developments, whereby the spectral algorithm for evaluating the concentration profiles for given fields was combined with Anderson mixing for solving the self-consistent
field equations.46 We have previously7,9,31−34 used a quasiNewton−Raphson algorithm (specifically the Broyden algorithm) to solve the field equations, which requires the
calculation of a Jacobian. This works exceptionally well when the morphology requires ≲100 generalized Fourier functions to accurately represent the composition profiles, and thus we still use it in these instances. However, far more Fourier terms are required for triply periodic phases at high segregation, and then the calculation of the Jacobian becomes prohibitive. Fortunately, Anderson mixing is capable of solving the field equations without a Jacobian, which permits calculations involving as many as 5000 basis functions with just a single computer processor. Even though our calculations were performed to high accuracy, we never needed more than 2000 basis functions. Pseudospectral methods can also be combined with Anderson mixing to produce an efficient algorithm for
calculating SCFT phase diagrams.44 However, the full-spectral method is still generally faster apart from the upper part of the complex phase channel, where the morphologies require ≳1000 basis functions. Furthermore, the spectral method is superior at handling some of the more complex architectures, such as the linear and comb multiblock copolymers in Figures 3 and 6, respectively. The real advantage of the spectral method though is that it only has one source of numerical inaccuracy to contend with, the truncation of the Fourier series. In contrast, the pseudospectral methods have two distinct sources, the finite spatial resolution and the finite step-size along the chain contour, making it far more of a chore to ensure sufficient
numerical accuracy.

SUMMARY
We have presented complete phase diagrams for six different AB-type block copolymer melts obtained with self-consistent field theory (SCFT). The principle that complex architectures can be decomposed in constituent AmBn stars appears to be reasonably accurate at strong segregations, but significant deviations are evident in the intermediate-segregation regime. Nevertheless, the qualitative behavior is preserved. For instance, the ABA triblock, linear ABAB... multiblock and diblock-arm star have phase diagrams that are topologically equivalent to that of the simple AB diblock. In all cases, the gyroid (G) morphology dominates the complex phase channel while the new Fddd (O70) microstructure remains stable in small regions extending down to the mean-field critical point. Similarly, the phase diagram for combs with A-type teeth and a B-type backbone has the same topology as that of AB2 miktoarm stars. In particular, the comb exhibits a stable region of A15 spheres
(SA15) in the same place Grason and Kamien36 predicted it for AB2 stars, and furthermore both architectures exhibit a perforated-lamellar (PL) morphology with perforations in the B-rich lamellae, which is stable between the L and G phases for well-segregated conditions. The appearance of the PL phase occurs presumably because the complex phase window is shifted toward large f, which thickens the A-rich lamellae thereby relieving packing frustration. The ability to use architecture to control the composition and size of the stability regions in the phase diagram is yet another useful means for designing block copolymer materials. However, investigating the effect of architecture by experiment alone would be extremely time-consuming and costly, and simple principles such as decomposing complex architectures into their constituent units are of limited application and accuracy. Fortunately, recent developments in numerical
methods44−46 allow high-precision SCFT calculations to be performed on even the most complex periodic morphologies

using very modest computational resources. Thus, SCFT will be a particularly valuable tool for navigating the immense
variety of possible architectures.
