ABSTRACT: The self-assembly of block copolymers is often rationalized by structure and microphase separation; pathways that diverge from this parameter space may provide new mechanisms of polymer assembly. Here, we show that the sequence and length of single-stranded DNA directly influence the self-assembly of sequence-defined DNA block copolymers. While increasing the length of DNA led to predictable changes in selfassembly, changing only the sequence of DNA produced three distinct structures: spherical micelles (spherical nucleic acids, SNAs) from flexible poly(thymine) DNA, fibers from semirigid mixed-sequence DNA, and networked superstructures from rigid poly(adenine) DNA. The secondary structure of poly(adenine) DNA strands drives a temperature-dependent polymerization and assembly mechanism: copolymers stored in an SNA reservoir form fibers after thermal activation, which then aggregate upon cooling to form interwoven networks. DNA is often used as a programming code that aids in nanostructure addressability and function. Here, we show that the inherent physical and chemical properties of single-stranded DNA sequences also make them an ideal material to direct self-assembled morphologies and select for new methods of supramolecular polymerization.

INTRODUCTION
Sequence-defined DNA amphiphiles are covalent polymer chains of monodisperse length and specific monomer order attached to single-stranded DNA, constructed efficiently and
rapidly on an automated DNA synthesizer.1−10 Self-assembly arises to minimize contact of the hydrophobic region with water, and the relative volume of the hydrophobic to hydrophilic block can play a major role in determining the
assembly morphology.11−13 Increasing the volume of the hydrophobic phase generally decreases the interfacial curvature (i.e., the curvature of the hydrophobic region at the interface between the two blocks) evolving the morphology from
spheres to cylinders to lamellae.14,15 In the case of DNA block copolymerswhere DNA is the hydrophilic segment, attached covalently to a block of hydrophobic monomersthis yields supramolecular structures with DNA coronas that can be addressed with functional moieties for numerous biological
and materials applications.7,16−20
Our group3,9,21−23 and others24,25 have explored modulation of the hydrophobic moietyits size, chemistry, and number of repeat monomersin forming diverse structures, but rarely has altering the hydrophilic DNA chain been investigated as a
driving force in self-assembly.26,27 Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) chains are not always disordered polymers electrostatics, π interactions, and base hydrophobicity can alter the conformation, rigidity, and internal structure of
ssDNA.28−33 Furthermore, intramolecular interactions between nonadjacent bases and phosphates on a single strand
of DNA may alter chain configuration, even transiently.34,35 We hypothesized that increasing the local concentration of DNA strands by enforcing their proximity in noncovalent assemblies would organize these otherwise unstable intermolecular interactions, forming structured hydrophilic coronas that directly affect self-assembly behavior. Here, we investigate the influence of the DNA chain sequence and length in driving the morphology and selfassembly mechanisms of DNA amphiphiles. All samples were annealed in the presence of 12.5 mM Mg2+ at pH 8. In line with the assembly principles of microphase separation, we observe that increasing DNA length produces assemblies with greater interfacial curvature. We observe that the sequence of nucleobases within DNA strands plays a significant role in dictating the self-assembled structure. DNA chains of the same length with different sequences produced different products: a random sequence DNA amphiphile was observed to polymerize into fibers over the entire thermal trajectory; one composed of only poly(adenine) residues was sequestered as a spherical micelle and only activated for fiber formation at a specific

persistence length, flexibility, and aromatic interactionsof different sequences of DNA determine the morphology of their resulting assemblies. Increasing the local concentration of these interactions by packing into a polymer corona amplifies these

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Changing DNA Length. We previously reported a DNA amphiphile containing a covalent polymer with 12 branched hydrophobic monomers (1,2-dodecanediol, C12) that are punctuated by phosphates, and appended to a random sequence of 19 DNA bases (C1212-DNA19, Figure 2a). This amphiphile undergoes thermally driven supramolecular polymerization to form long, one-dimensional fibers (Figures 1a
and 2c):9 the hydrophobic block curls at elevated temperatures to expose the phosphates and hide the C12 chains, promoting
fusion and fiber elongation (Figure 1a).9 By increasing the length of the hydrophilic DNA segment, we expect the selfassembly morphology to change following principles of microphase separation: as the amphiphilic packing parameter decreases, we expect assemblies with increasing interfacial
curvature.15 Tuning the relative length of polymer blocks is an efficient tool for controlling morphology: a size- and shapedefined DNA nanostructure may be assembled from a single molecular species, and each different morphology can influence
cellular uptake and bioactivity properties.36,37 Lengthening the DNA segment from 19 to 33 bases (C1212DNA33) resulted in the formation of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) (Figures 2d and S8). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed a diffusion coefficient (D) an order of magnitude higher and less disperse than the fibers formed by C1212DNA19 (Table S3), suggesting smaller, more uniform
structures that were confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) as SNAs (Figure 2d). Shortening the length of the DNA segment to 5 nucleotide units (C1212-DNA5) gave
lamellar structures with sheet heights of 7.7 ± 0.5 nm, as observed by AFM (Figures 2b and S9) and reflected in native agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE, Figure S10). DLS gave unstable high intensity signals due to the presence of large aggregated assemblies. We were thus able to switch between three unique polymer morphologies by varying the length of the hydrophilic DNA segment alone from 5 to 33 bases (Figure 2), highlighting the importance of length control in DNA amphiphile self-assembly. The sequence-specific addressability of the DNA corona allowed us to construct hierarchical superstructures of C1212
DNA19 fibers using strand hybridization (Figure 3). When a
complement strand DNA19′ was hybridized to fibers of C1212
DNA19 in solution, the fiber corona became double stranded. This process produced blunt ended DNA termini that promoted π-interactions between fibers, resulting in their
intermolecular association.1 Micron-scale hierarchical structures were observed by AFM, composed of densely packed supramolecular fibers aligned parallel to one another (Figures 3a and S11). When a two thymidine overhang was added to DNA19′ and hybridized to fibers of C1212-DNA19, no hierarchical structures were observed, as no blunt ends were available for association (Figure S12). As a positive control, a complement strand to DNA19 with a self-complementary GC overhang was added to C1212-DNA19 and hierarchical
structures of aligned fibers were observed, with a similar morphology and interfiber distance to that of the no-overhang case (Figures S13 and 14). Blunt end stacks can thus be used to control the hierarchical assembly of our addressable DNA fibers. Similar materials are common in biological contexts such as muscle fibers or the extracellular matrix, where
organized supramolecular polymers provide mechanical function and specific motifs for interacting with cells.
Changing DNA Sequence. We observed that simply changing the sequence of the DNA block, without changing the length of the chain, could alter the self-assembly behavior of our DNA amphiphiles (Figure 1). Our 19mer DNA amphiphile C1212-DNA19 was designed as a random sequence with a 5mer thymidine connector proximal to the hydrophobic chains. This amphiphile forms fibers at all annealing temperatures as observed by AGE (Figure S18). Replacing the hydrophilic segment with a 19mer poly(thymine) sequence did not produce fibers when heated up to 90 °C; only spherical micelles were observed by AGE and AFM (Figure 4). In

contrast to random DNA sequence C1212-DNA19 fibers and C1212-T19 spheres, C1212-A19wherein the DNA sequence is poly(adenine)formed SNAs at room temperature, and only formed fibers when annealed above 60 °C (SI Section 7). These three distinct assembly behaviorsall using the same length of DNAsuggest that the choice of nucleobase affects the amphiphile’s self-assembly. The precise structures formed, however, appear counterintuitive: adenine is larger than thymine, such that the volume of a poly(dA) strand should be larger than that of a poly(dT) strand of equal length, yet we observe assemblies with greater interfacial curvature of poly(dT), as compared to poly(dA). Thymidine is also more hydrophobic than adenosine,28 which should evolve the assembly further, rather than closer, to a spherical morphology. Crucially important, however, is that the persistence length of single-stranded DNA varies greatly with nucleotide number
and sequence:38 for example, a poly(dA) sequence has a higher persistence length than poly(dT), owing to the presence of base stacking interactions between purine basesit presents as a rigid, structured helix, akin to double-stranded B-DNA.39−42 We propose that this higher conformational freedom for poly(dT) produces hydrophilic blocks with a larger volume, proximal to the hydrophobic core for C1212-T19; whereas in C1212-A19 these hydrophilic DNA blocks are more rigid and elongated, reducing interfacial curvature between blocks and promoting their polymerization. A random DNA sequence which incorporates a mixture of pyrimidines and purineshas an intermediate persistence length between the extremes of rigid A19 (purine only) and flexible T19 (pyrimidine only). Despite being all DNA, poly(dA), poly(dT), and a random sequence are analogous to three different hydrophilic polymers

with differing rigidity, translating into three unique assembly behaviors. The polymerization of C1212-A19 into fibers was activated
abruptly at 60 °C, as discerned by AFM (Figure 5b,c), AGE (Figure 5d), and UV spectra (Figure 5e). By variable temperature UV spectroscopy, we observed the appearance of broad spectral bands at >260 nm past 60 °C, corresponding to the Rayleigh scattering of our thermoset supramolecular polymers formed in situ (Figure S30). Concurrently, we observed a sharp hyperchromicity of the band at 260 nm, accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of all CD bands with increasing temperature (Figure S32). Poly(dA) exists as a
structured helix at room temperature;43 thus our spectroscopic data indicate that stacking interactions between adjacent adenine residues break upon heating, suggesting that the secondary structure of the poly(dA) collapses upon heating and fiber formation. Due to the rigid and persistent hold at room temperature, we thus propose that the adenine chains kinetically trap the morphology into a spherical micelle and prevent fiber formation, which requires reorganization and curling of the hydrophobic chains to align on top of one another (Figure 1). At 60 °C, the melting of the adenine stacks brings enough conformational freedom to allow rearrangement of the hydrophobic block and subsequent polymerization into fibrous architectures (Figure 5a). Upon cooling, our C1212-A19 fibers aggregate into hierarchical superstructures (Figures 5), whereas C1212
DNA19 is observed as individual long fibers by AFM.9 The assembly of C1212-A19 into superstructures occurs upon
cooling in the range 60−50 °C, as shown by hypochromicity in the UV−vis spectra (Figure 5e). The rate of cooling was observed to significantly affect the resulting morphology: Single fibers, two or three fibers in parallel, and starburst fiber
structures resulted from rapid cooling (50 °C min−1), whereas
slow cooling at 0.2 °C min−1 resulted in large, interwoven, and threaded architectures, as observed by AFM and TEM (Figures 5c and 6). Commensurate with a slow reassembly
mechanism, a large hysteresis (ca. 14 °C) was observed between assembly and disassembly of these superstructures by UV−vis spectroscopy (Figure 5f). The morphology of these superstructures, in which individual fibers prefer to align parallel to one another (Figure 6), suggest that the DNA corona is directing self-assembly upon cooling. We hypothesize that both our temperature-specific polymerization and hierarchical aggregates for C1212-A19 are a result of
the adenine−adenine interactions within and between the
DNA chains. Unique among the DNA bases, poly(adenine) strands exist as structured helices in solution, owing to nucleobase high aromatic surface areas, penchant for π−π
stacking and self-complementary hydrogen bonding.32,39 These interactions break apart upon heating, which may lead to less structured DNA coronas that allow the conversion of kinetically trapped SNAs into fibers (Figure 5ai−ii). Upon cooling, these intramolecular interactions are restabilized: Extended π surfaces form at the corona-solvent boundary from a combination of the rigid, π-stacked individual poly(dA) strands and dynamic blunt end termini between DNA strands, resulting in superstructures (Figures 5aiii−iv and 6) in a similar manner to the double-stranded blunt end amphiphile in Figure 3. The increased local concentration of poly(dA) strands within the fiber coronas may enhance interchain association by hydrogen bonding (adenine is self-complementary) and/or πstacking, generating analogous parallel structures with dynamic blunt end termini. Single-stranded poly(adenine) DNA is mostly in the C2′endo or B-DNA form, with a minor contribution of the C3′
endo or A-DNA form.32,44 The largest contributor to the Aform in a typical d(A)n strand is the 3′-end residue which has the greatest conformational mobility, as compared to the more rigid internal adenines and 5′-end. In the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of poly(dA), a positive band at 270 nm indicates the B- vs A-DNA ratio: the smaller it is, the lower the
A-DNA contribution.44 Thus, the CD band at 270 nm can also indicate the extent of the conformational mobility of the 3′endthe smaller the band, the more rigid the 3′-end, resulting in a lower A-DNA contribution. Upon assembly of C1212-A19
into the SNA and fiber states, the positive CD band at 270 nm diminishes, suggesting that, in these nanostructures, the adenine chains are more B-DNA-like (Figure S32). This supports reduced conformational mobility of the 3′-end of poly(dA) sequences in the nanostructures, which lie at the corona−water interface. This more rigid interface in the SNA state can provide an energy barrier to chain rearrangement and fiber formation that is absent in other DNA sequences of the same length. Once the fibers are formed, this rigid corona− solvent interface can result in stronger blunt end interactions and fiber aggregation. When a complementary DNA strand with a 2T overhang was hybridized to fibers of C1212-DNA19, we observed that no
interfiber aggregation occurred (Figure S12). To further investigate our hypothesis of adenine−adenine base stacking interactions in C1212-A19, we capped the 3′ terminus of the A19 strand with two thymidine monomers (C1212-A19T2).
Polymerization to form fibers occurred over all temperature ranges as observed by AGE (Figure S35) without the formation of kinetically trapped SNAs. Fibers were significantly shorter that those of C1212-A19 and few hierarchical aggregates were observed by AFM (Figure S36), suggesting that the presence of adenine nucleobases at the solvent−corona boundary was critical for temperature-activated polymerization. It is possible that the 2T overhang folds back onto the A19 strands, thus reducing adenine−adenine interactions
and decreasing strand rigidity at the 3′-strand ends, which reside at the solvent−corona boundary. That C1212-A19T2 does not form aggregate superstructures akin to C1212-A19
further suggests that blunt end stacking, rather than interfiber hybridization, is responsible for their hierarchical assembly. We further explored the rigidity of our DNA constructs by adding Hoechst’s dye 33342 (Figure 7), a small molecule

distances were calculated to be 12.9 ± 1.4 nm, consistent with proximal π−π stacking between fibers. Scale bars = 200 nm.

known to bind to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA,
producing a positive induced CD (ICD) signal at ca. 360 nm.45 In both the SNA and fiber states of C1212-A19 this ICD signal was enhanced as compared to free A19, suggesting improved binding of the dye in these assembled states (Figure 7a). In contrast, no ICD signal for C1212-T19 was observed, consistent with the greater rigidity and B-DNA character of C1212-A19 (Figure 7b). Upon heating the C1212-A19 SNAs, the ICD spectrum shifted from one dominated by interdye charge transfer (20 → 40 °C), to one dominated by off-resonance dye-DNA exciton coupling (40 → 60 °C), and finally
unbinding of the dye (at >60 °C) (Figure S37).46 These spectral progressions indicate conformational changes occurring in the poly(dA) corona upon heating. Held rigid in the SNA state, the DNA strands melt upon heating, breaking intramolecular adenine−adenine interactions that disorganize the SNA corona, leading to unbinding of the dye as the DNA strand approaches a less structured state. Our data suggest that our C1212-A19 SNAs act as reservoirs
that first store single amphiphile chains and subsequently release them for polymerization following DNA melting. Two forces compete at elevated temperature: As the poly(dA) corona becomes less structured, the thermosetting core cements at the same time. When the corona becomes more dynamic at higher temperature, rearrangement of the hydrophobic strands to a curled conformation is enabled, promoting core fusion and fiber formation. The SNA corona thus provides an additional activation barrier to polymerization. Increasing temperature overcomes the π-stacking of poly(adenine) strands, allowing their conformations to approximate that of random DNA at elevated temperatures, enabling fiber formation (Figure 5a). This polymerization mechanism can override the morphology predicted by microphase separation. A 30mer of poly(dA) attached to 12 C12 units C1212-A30 formed first SNAs at room
temperature, followed by the formation of fibers upon heating past 70 °C (Figures 8 and S43), in the same manner as C1212A19. This activation temperature is slightly higher than that for the shorter A19 sequence, commensurate with the greater degree of thermal stability expected for longer lengths of DNA. C1212-A30 fibers also formed hierarchical aggregates depending
on their length and rate of cooling. Longer fibers produced micron-length clumpy aggregates when cooled rapidly; they formed extended aggregates when cooled slowly (Figure 8, right). We expected an A30 corona to produce SNAs exclusively (in line with the assembly of the random sequence 33mer C1212-DNA33 shown in Figure 2). The deviation from an SNA structure at elevated temperature is commensurate with the thermal activation of the DNA strands for fiber formation; upon cooling, the corresponding increase in rigidity

CONCLUSIONS
The morphology and pathway complexity of self-assembled DNA amphiphiles cannot be predicted by the length of the hydrophilic DNA chain alone. Progressively increasing the length of a random sequence DNA block changed the resultant morphology from sheets to fibers to spheres; as expected from changes in the amphiphile packing parameter. In contrast, changing only the sequence of DNA had unexpected impacts on the self-assembly. Different morphologies were observed for the same length of DNA with different sequencesspheres for T19, fibers for random sequence DNA19 and networked fibers
for A19due to differences in their single-stranded con
formations. While fibers were formed at all temperatures for random sequence DNA19 amphiphiles, A19 amphiphiles first assembled into kinetically trapped spherical micelles, and only produced fibers upon thermal denaturation of their structured poly(dA) corona. The assembly pathways were also affected by interpolymer chain−chain interactions and the solvent−corona interface, driving the assembly of hierarchical superstructures. Resembling biological tissues such as tendon and extracellular matrices, these superstructures consisted of densely packed supramolecular fibers that may find applications in tissue engineering and delivery. DNA self-assembly in biology and nanotechnology is fundamentally dictated by sequence. In this work we have extended the role of DNA sequence beyond the typical paradigm of complementarity, embracing the chemical and physical properties of specific single-stranded DNA sequences to dictate polymerization and assembly pathways. The results show that different sequences of DNA can act like blocks of different hydrophilic polymers both within, and diverging from, the simple principles of amphiphilic block copolymer selfassembly. The potential to replace other hydrophilic polymers with different sequences of DNA may allow improvements in biocompatibility and therapeutic function of many block copolymer systems. Understanding and developing new corona interactions using DNA amphiphiles could additionally unlock the potential of DNA-minimal structures for new hierarchical assemblies that proffer sensing, diagnostic, and drug delivery applications. Future work will expand upon the sequence diversity of DNA within our block copolymers, with the goal of programming individual sequences to be activated for polymerization at specific temperatures.
