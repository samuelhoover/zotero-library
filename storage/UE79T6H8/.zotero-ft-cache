Using a combination of spectral identification techniquessgas chromatography coupled with low- and high-resolution electron-impact mass spectrometry (GC/EIMS), low- and high-resolution chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC/CI-MS), and infrared spectroscopy (GC/ IR)swe identified many drinking water disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formed by ozone and combinations of ozone with chlorine and chloramine. Many of these DBPs have not been previously reported. In addition to conventional XAD resin extraction, both pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine (PFBHA) and methylation derivatizations were used to aid in identifying some of the more polar DBPs. Many of the byproducts identified were not present in spectral library databases. The vast majority of the ozone DBPs identified contained oxygen in their structures, with no halogenated DBPs observed except when chlorine or chloramine was applied as a secondary disinfectant. In comparing byproducts formed by secondary treatment of chlorine or chloramine, chloramine appeared to form the same types of halogenated DBPs as chlorine, but they were generally fewer in number and lower in concentration. Most of the halogenated DBPs that were formed by ozonechlorine and ozone-chloramine treatments were also observed in samples treated with chlorine or chloramine only. A few DBPs, however, were formed at higher levels in the ozone-chlorine and ozone-chloramine samples, indicating that the combination of ozone and chlorine or chloramine is important in their formation. These DBPs included dichloroacetaldehyde and 1,1-dichloropropanone.
Introduction
Ozone is becoming a popular drinking water disinfectant in the United States, partly due to its effectiveness for killing microorganisms but also due to the lack of production of
trihalomethanes (THMs). The Stage I DBP Rule, which was promulgated in December 1998, lowers the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for total THMs from 100 to 80 μg/L (1, 2), increasing the difficulty for drinking water treatment plants using chlorine to meet regulatory requirements. In 1997, the number of drinking water treatment plants using ozone was approximately 150; in 1998, that number nearly doubled to more than 260 ozone treatment plants (3). Examples of two large ozone plants include the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant, serving Los Angeles, CA, and the Lanier Water Treatment Plant, serving Gwinnett County, GA (in metropolitan Atlanta).
Although ozone is being used at many drinking water plants in the United States and in many more plants in Europe, there have been relatively few studies conducted to determine the identity of ozonation byproducts. The vast majority of byproducts reported for ozone contain oxygen in their structures, with no halogenated DBPs reported unless high natural levels of bromide (Br-) are present in the raw water. Organic DBPs that have been reported include aldehydes, ketones, ketoaldehydes, carboxylic acids, aldo acids, keto acids, hydroxy acids, alcohols, esters, and alkanes (4-14). Some of these byproducts were reported from actual drinking water samples and others from laboratory reactions of ozone with humic material or natural waters. Inorganic DBPs previously reported include bromate and hypobromite, which are formed at elevated bromide levels, and hydrogen peroxide (4, 5, 9). Because most of the earlier studies did not use methods to extract and identify highly polar byproducts, it is commonly believed that many ozone DBPs have yet to be identified. Derivatization with pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine (PFBHA) has enabled the identification of some of the polar DBPs reported, including small polar aldehydes and ketones, such as formaldehyde, glyoxal, and acetone (9).
Because ozone is becoming widely used in the United States and because there is significant uncertainty over the DBPs that are formed, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Exposure Research Laboratory in Athens, GA, and the National Risk Management Research Laboratory in Cincinnati, OH, have set out to comprehensively identify all detectable DBPs from ozone. Until DBPs have been comprehensively identified, it is not known whether ozone forms compounds that are more or less harmful than those produced by chlorine. In addition, there is very little known about the identity of DBPs when a secondary disinfectant, such as chlorine or chloramine, is applied after ozonation. Most drinking water treatment plants using ozone also use a secondary disinfectant to maintain disinfection in the distribution system. The goal of our work was to identify organic DBPs produced from ozone alone and in combination with chlorine or chloramine. Rather than attempting to identify a few expected target byproducts, our objective was to identify as many compounds as possible that were detected in the sample extracts.
Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the common analysis tool for identifying compounds in environmental samples. Typically, GC/MS analyses use only one type of MS: low-resolution electron-impact (EI) mass spectrometry. This type of analysis is sufficient for regulated compounds that have been well-characterized and whose spectra are in a library database. However, unknown compounds, such as newly identified DBPs, are often impossible to identify from this type of data alone, as many of these compounds are not present in any library database.

As a result, we used a combination of several mass spectrometry techniques as well as infrared spectroscopy to identify these unknown byproducts. To aid in extracting polar aldehydes and ketones from drinking water, derivatization with PFBHA was used. Methylation was used to enable the detection and identification of carboxylic acids.
Experimental Section
Ozone Treatments. Ozonations were carried out at a pilot plant in Jefferson Parish, LA, which uses Mississippi River water as the raw water source. Four rounds of treatment were performed in January 1994 (round 1), August 1994 (round 2), May 1995 (round 3), and September 1996 (round 4). The total organic carbon (TOC) of the raw, untreated water was 2.7, 2.6, 3.7, and 3.0 mg/L, respectively. Other water quality parameters measured for the four rounds of treatment were as follows: temperature, 7.8, 28.5, 18.5, and 28.5 °C; pH, 7.4, 7.6, 7.5, and 7.9; total alkalinity, 102, 110, 112, and 140 mg/L; total hardness, 172, 174, 152, and 182 mg/L as CaCO3; calcium hardness, 123, 103, 88, and 115 mg/L as CaCO3; and turbidity, 1.35, 0.85, 1.25, and 0.98 NTU. Natural levels of bromide are low in this source water, with a yearly average of 0.054 mg/L. All rounds included treatment with ozone alone and treatment with ozone followed by secondary chlorine or chloramine. For each round, untreated, raw water was collected to enable the distinction between the actual DBPs of ozone and ozone plus chlorine or chloramine and chemicals that were already present in the raw water. For treatment rounds 3 and 4, 1 L of treated water was removed prior to resin concentration for derivatization with PFBHA (described below). Some rounds of treatment also included the effect of added bromide to the raw water. Those results can be found in the following paper in this issue (34). Drinking water treatments were carried out in the following manner. Raw water was pumped to the full-scale plant where it was clarified with diallyldimethylammonium chloride or dimethylamine-type cationic polymers. Following clarification, samples were taken before disinfection and after disinfection with ozone at the pilot plant. Ozone was generated from compressed dry air using an electrically powered ozone generator with a maximum output capacity of 0.25 lb/day. The ozone contact chamber was 11 ft in height, with countercurrent operation consisting of water entering at the top of the contact chamber and ozone gas entering at the bottom. The water and ozone gas influent lines were oriented so that the influent water would be in contact with the ozone gas stream for approximately 30 min. Ozone doses were approximately 2.1, 4.3, 3.0, and 4.3 mg/L for treatment rounds 1-4, respectively. Sufficient chlorine and chloramine were added individually after ozonation to achieve a chlorine/ chloramine residual ranging from 2 to 3 mg/L. Chloramine was generated with a 4:1 ratio of Cl2:NH3-N, which produced predominantly monochloramine (>99%), with dichloramine measured at 0.3% of the total residual. The term “chloramine” is used throughout this paper because in the generation of monochloramine (the active disinfectant) there are usually two other species of chloramine also formed in minor quantities (dichloramine and trichloramine). Samples were then collected after filtration through dual media (sand and anthracite). Samples involving treatment with only chlorine or chloramine were also collected to determine whether a given DBP was formed by the combination of disinfectants (e.g., ozone-chlorine) or by the secondary disinfectant only. Sample Concentration. All water samples (150 L), except water used in PFBHA derivatizations, were concentrated by adsorption on Amberlite XAD resins. Details about the preparation and cleaning of these resins can be found elsewhere (15). Water samples were acidified to pH 2 by the addition of HCl prior to passage through columns containing a combination of XAD-8 resin (195 mL) over XAD-2 resin
(195 mL). The combination of XAD-8 over XAD-4 has been shown to be effective for adsorbing a wide range of organic compounds, including MX [MX is 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone] (16-19). A maximum ratio of 770:1 (v/v) of water to resin was used to maximize the adsorption of organic compounds and to minimize breakthrough (16, 17). The columns were eluted with ethyl acetate, which has been shown to be efficient for the elution of organic compounds from XAD resins (19). Residual water was removed from the ethyl acetate eluents by using separatory funnels to drain off the water layers, followed by the addition of sodium sulfate. After removal of an aliquot for mutagenicity testing, the ethyl acetate eluents (equivalent to approximately 75 L of treated water) were shipped on cold packs to the National Exposure Research Laboratory in Athens, GA. At the laboratory, the samples were concentrated to 1 mL by rotary evaporation. In addition to the raw water controls, four blanks were also analyzed: (a) ethyl acetate passed through the XAD resins and concentrated in the same manner as the treated samples; (b) deionized, distilled water passed through the XAD resins and concentrated; (c) deionized, distilled water treated with chlorine and concentrated; and (d) deionized, distilled water treated with chloramine and concentrated. The latter two blanks were done to determine whether there were any artifacts due to reaction of secondary disinfectants with the ethyl acetate or with resin impurities. As compared to the raw water samples and the treated samples, these blanks contained relatively few compounds. Derivatizations. PFBHA derivatizations were used to extract and aid in the identification of relatively polar carbonyl-containing compounds. For this work, 750 mL of treated water (and raw water as a control) was derivatized with PFBHA according to a procedure published by Sclimenti et al. (20). Derivatized aldehydes and ketones were then extracted with hexane and concentrated to 1 mL by rotary evaporation. PFBHA derivativatization was crucial to identifying low molecular weight aldehydes and ketones and also dicarbonyl compounds; higher molecular weight aldehydes and ketones (C6-compounds and higher) could be detected with or without the PFBHA derivatization. Methylation derivatizations with BF3-methanol were used to aid in identifying carboxylic acids (21). BF3-methanol was chosen over diazomethane as the methylating agent because it has been shown to be more effective for compounds that are difficult to methylate, such as MX-related compounds (21). Carboxylic acids were often detected without methylation, but their chromatographic peaks were much broader than for the methylated derivatives, which complicated their detection and separation from other closely eluting compounds.
TOC, TOX, and AOC Determinations. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were determined using the wet oxidation method (22). The adsorption-pyrolysis-titrimetric method was used for total organic halide (TOX) analyses (22). Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) was determined using a modification of the Pseudomonas fluorescens strain P-17 and Spirillum strain NOX method (22). THM and HAA Analyses. Trihalomethanes were measured using EPA Method 551 (23). Haloacetic acids were measured using EPA Method 552.0 (23). GC/MS Analysis. High-resolution GC/EI-MS and GC/CIMS analyses were performed on a VG 70-SEQ high-resolution, hybrid mass spectrometer, equipped with a Hewlett-Packard model 5890A gas chromatograph. The high-resolution mass spectrometer was operated at an accelerating voltage of 8 kV and at a resolution of 10 000. Low-resolution GC/EI-MS experiments were carried out on the VG 70-SEQ mass spectrometer, and low-resolution GC/CI-MS experiments were carried out on a Finnigan TSQ 7000. Positive chemical

ionization experiments were accomplished by using methane or 2% ammonia in methane gases. Injections of 1-2 μL of the extract were introduced via a split/splitless injector onto a J&W Scientific DB-5 chromatographic column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). The GC temperature program consisted of an initial temperature of 35 °C, which was held for 4 min, followed by an increase at a rate of 9 °C/min to 285 °C, which was held for 30 min. Transfer lines were held at 280 °C, and the injection port was controlled at 250 °C. GC/IR Analysis. GC/IR analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 series II GC interfaced to a Hewlett-Packard model 5965B infrared detector (IRD). Spectra were generated at 8 cm-1 resolution with a useful range of 4000-700 cm-1. Injections of 2 μL of the extracts were introduced onto a Restek Rtx-5 column (30 m, 0.32 mm i.d., 0.5 μm film thickness) with a heated on-column injector (280 °C). The GC temperature program consisted of an initial temperature of 35 °C, which was held for 4 min, followed by an increase at a rate of 9 °C/min to 280 °C, which was held for 30 min. Transfer lines and the light pipe were controlled at 280 °C. Chemical Standards. The following chemicals were prepared synthetically: 3-methylpentanal, 5-methoxypentanal, 1-methoxy-3-pentanone, 5-methoxy-2-pentanone, 6-methoxy-2-hexanone, 6-hydroxy-2-hexanone, and 5-keto1-hexanal. Details of these synthesis procedures can be obtained in Supporting Information. A synthetic standard of PFBHA-derivatized cyanoformaldehyde was purchased from CanSyn (Toronto, Canada). All other chemicals were purchased at the highest level of purity from Aldrich, Chem Service, and TCI America.
Results and Discussion
Overall, many DBPs were identified, several of which have never been reported previously. Many of the compounds were not present in any spectral library (NIST or Wiley), and many of the ones that were in the libraries did not give conclusive library matches. Many of the compounds provided little information in their mass spectra, with an absence of definitive molecular weight information in many cases. As a result, we used CI-MS frequently to generate molecular ions. High-resolution EI-MS was an indispensable tool for determining structures, as it provided the necessary empirical formula information for the molecular ion and fragments. It also helped to limit the number of possible structures for each unknown DBP. GC/IR was very useful for compounds where there was a choice of structures (based on mass spectral information). When available, standards were purchased or synthesized to confirm identifications and to determine a particular isomer precisely when spectra were not conclusive. In this way, GC retention times and spectra of the standards were matched with those of the unknowns. It should be noted that, although we attempted to identify every DBP detected in the samples, several DBPs were present at such low concentrations that there was not sufficient spectral information to enable their identification. For completeness, THMs and haloacetic acids (HAAs), which are common DBPs of chlorine and chloramine, were quantified for these drinking water samples. These halogenated DBPs were not observed for ozone treatment but were observed for ozone-chlorine and ozone-chloramine treatments and will be discussed later. The criteria we used for listing an identified compound as a DBP was its presence in the treated samples in quantities at least 2-3 times greater than in the untreated, raw water (as judged by comparing chromatographic peak areas). We believe it is important to distinguish a compound as a DBP, even if small amounts of the compound are present in the raw water. Many compounds that are common pollutants or
that are used industrially have also been proven to be DBPs. Chloroform is one examplesit is used industrially and has been identified as a pollutant, but it is also a proven chlorine DBP. As a result, we did not want to omit potentially important DBPs, but we recognize at the same time that our criteria may screen out a few such DBPs that are formed in small quantities. In addition, it should be noted that some compounds listed as DBPs, namely, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are actually present in the water in a different form. Because they are commonly referenced in the literature as aldehydes and carboxylic acids, we have kept with that convention in our lists. However, some of these DBPs are predominantly present in a hydrated form in the water. As an example, trichloroacetaldehyde (Cl3CC(O)H) is actually present as Cl3CCH(OH)2 and is thus correctly referred to as chloral hydrate. Also, most of the carboxylic acids will be present in the water as carboxylates, as the pKa values of these acids usually will be below the pH of the drinking water.
Identification of Ozone DBPs
DBPs Identified from Conventional XAD Resin Extraction. Table 1 lists the ozone DBPs identified (Supporting Information provides the details about the types and rounds of treatment for which the DBPs were found and also for spectral information used in the identifications). The vast majority of the ozone DBPs contained oxygen in their chemical structures, with aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids being the major classes of byproducts observed. Carboxylic acids, which are also formed by other disinfectantsschlorine, chloramine, and chlorine dioxidesare often overlooked as ozone DBPs. In the four rounds of treatment studied here, the carboxylic acids appeared to be at higher concentrations than other DBPs observed. As mentioned previously, accurate quantitation was not performed for compounds other than THMs and HAAs; therefore, the precise concentrations of these other byproducts are not known. An upcoming occurrence study of DBPs in drinking water will determine quantitatively many of the DBPs reported here. Many of the carboxylic acids were also present in the raw, untreated water but at lower levels.
Identification of Ozone DBPs Derivatized with PFBHA. For treatment rounds 3 and 4, PFBHA derivatization was used to help identify ozone DBPs. These DBPs are denoted in Table 1. Hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, and decanal were also identified in the resin extracts without derivatization. None of the PFBHA derivatives were present in the library mass spectral databases. Figure 1 illustrates the PFBHA reaction, and Figure 2 shows a GC/MS chromatogram obtained for one of the samples (round 3, ozone treatment). Three sets of chromatographic peaks evident in Figure 2 were determined by high-resolution MS to represent forms of the derivatizing agent (hydrolyzed PFBHA, unreacted PFBHA, and “dimerized” PFBHA, labeled in Figure 2) with molecular formulas of C6F5CH2-OH, C6F5-CH2-O-NH2, and C6F5CH2-O-NdCH-C6F5, respectively. When PFBHA reacts with a compound containing a single carbonyl group, two geometric isomers (syn and anti) are formed (Figure 1), except for symmetrical compounds, such as formaldehyde and acetone (4). These geometric isomers are evident in Figure 2 as they eluted differently under our chromatographic conditions. Compounds containing multiple carbonyl groups can form multiple isomers (2n - i, where n is the number of carbonyl groups and i is the number of planes of symmetry in the molecule). These multiple isomers (syn-syn, anti-anti, syn-anti, and anti-syn) are not always evident in the chromatogram due to poor chromatographic separation, due to interference with coeluting compounds, or due to their presence at concentrations below the detection limit.

Typically, several isomers were apparent at each molecular weight. The mass spectra were very similar for each isomer (and for aldehydes vs ketones of the same molecular weight), making exact isomer assignment impossible from this information alone. Evident for all of the derivatized aldehydes and ketones was a base peak of m/z 181 that has been observed by others (4, 20). The presence of this ion enables all of the derivatives of interest to be quickly distinguished from surrounding, nonderivatized chemicals in the complex mixture. In this way, reconstructed ion chromatograms that display only compounds having the m/z 181 in their mass spectra can be created after the analysis to indicate the PFBHA derivatives. Also evident for almost all of these carbonyl derivatives was a loss of 17 Da in their mass spectra. Using
high-resolution EI-MS, we confirmed this loss to be a loss of OH•. This type of fragmentation is highly unusual, as the OH• oxygen is removed from the middle of an ether linkage, breaking three bonds and reforming two bonds. We will address this fragmentation mechanism in a subsequent publication. We examined the IR spectra closely to determine if derivatized aldehydes could be distinguished from ketones. Theoretically, there should be a slight difference in the CH stretch between derivatized aldehydes and ketones, as only aldehydes will have a hydrogen attached directly to the nitrogen-bonded carbon (see below). In examining several derivatized aldehyde and ketone standards, however, this particular CH stretch, which should occur at approximately

2850 cm-1, was not observed (probably too weak as compared to other aliphatic and aromatic CH stretches). To determine if subtle differences in the EI-MS fragmentation could be used to distinguish aldehydes from ketones and to enable the identification of isomers, we analyzed many aldehyde and ketone standards (Table 2). From this information, it appears that most saturated aldehydes and ketones share a similar fragmentation pattern (see below, illustrated for n-hexanal and 2-hexanone), which involves cleavage of the bond between the carbons 2 and 3 (R and ‚ to the carbonyl group), together with a McLafferty rearrangement to form an odd-electron fragment (24).
The hydrogen transferred to the fragment ion originates from the hydrogen at carbon-4, which involves the formation of
a six-membered ring transition state.
As a result, a 4-carbon chain minimum is needed for this rearrangement to occur. These types of fragment ions are usually quite abundant, typically second in relative abundance to the m/z 181 base peak. Although these fragmentation mechanisms are the same, the masses are different for an aldehyde and a ketone of the same molecular weight. As a result, unless there is branching at carbon-2 on the aldehyde (which would form an ion of the same mass as a corresponding ketone), saturated aldehydes and ketones can usually be distinguished. As an example, for the n-hexanal and 2-hexanone derivatives (MW 295, Table 2), this type of fragmentation produces an abundant fragment ion at m/z 239 for n-hexanal and one at m/z 253 for 2-hexanone. However, although the observed differences in the relative abundances of fragment ions appear to provide an indication of whether the compound is an aldehyde or a ketone, it was evident that individual isomers would be impossible to assign from this information alone. Therefore, authentic standards had to be purchased or synthesized to make definitive structural determinations for many of these compounds.
A surprise from this identification work was the number of ketones present in the ozonated drinking water. These identifications were confirmed with standards. Very few ketones have been previously published. Because they show spectra very similar to the aldehydes, it is possible that these compounds were previously believed to be aldehydes.

The identification of a compound that has not been previously reported will serve to illustrate how we identified an unknown PFBHA-derivatized DBP. This PFBHA-derivatized compound has a molecular weight of 311, and its mass spectrum is shown in Figure 3. It was observed in both rounds of treatment (3 and 4) where derivatization with PFBHA was applied. We believe that this DBPsthe only DBP with a molecular weight of 311sis likely the same compound that was tentatively identified as oxopentanoic acid in a previous publication (6). However, if it is the same DBP, it was misidentified. From exact mass data provided by highresolution EI-MS (molecular formula of C13H14NO2F5), this DBP derivative has two oxygens in its structure, not three as would the PFBHA derivative of oxopentanoic acid. This illustrates the power that high-resolution mass spectrometry can provide. Empirical formula assignments, which are often ambiguous and difficult to make with low-resolution mass spectrometry, are clear and definitive with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Exact masses and empirical formula assignments determined by high-resolution MS are shown for the molecular ion and fragments in Figure 3. Once the empirical formula of the molecular ion and fragments were determined, two different types of structures were likely: a ketone with a methoxy group or a hydroxy group. A ketone structure was most likely (vs an aldehyde) due to the presence of m/z 253, which is common for ketones of molecular mass 281 Da and higher and involves the McLafferty rearrangement discussed earlier. Both methoxy and hydroxy ketones would satisfy the molecular formula determined by high-resolution MS. Because there was not enough information present in the mass spectrum to make a precise structural isomer assignment, candidate compounds were synthesized. Due to the difficulty and time involved in organic synthesis, we initially selected three of the possibilities that we believed were the most promising candidates. Their structures are shown below.
Each of these compounds would be expected to show the fragment losses present in the mass spectrum of the unknown compound, namely (M - 31)+, (M - 45)+, and (M - 58)•+. Table 2 lists the important mass spectral ions for each of these PFBHA-derivatized standards. Although there were similarities in the spectra of these standards, there were also distinct differences. Namely, each methoxy compound
showed a loss of 15 (CH3), which was notably absent in the spectrum of the unknown. Also, neither of the methoxy compounds showed a substantial loss of 17 Da, unlike this unknown and most other aldehydes and ketones. Fortunately, the mass spectrum and retention time of the unknown matched that of the synthesized hydroxy standard, 6-hydroxy2-hexanone, confirming its identity. Retention times for the methoxy compounds were significantly shorter (Table 2).
Another interesting compound, cyanoformaldehyde, has been previously reported by Coleman et al. as a tentative identification (6). CI-MS confirmed the molecular weight of 250 (PFBHA derivative). The low concentration of this compound precluded an exact molecular formula determination by high-resolution MS and also precluded obtaining an infrared spectrum. However, with a molecular weight of 250, there must be a nitrogen present in the structure of this compound because, from the “nitrogen rule” (24), an even molecular mass must have either no nitrogens or an even number of nitrogens. And, because there is one already present in the PFBHA portion of the derivative, there must be an additional nitrogen present. Then, allowing for the carbonyl carbon, there remains only 13 Da in the molecular mass, which must be CH. We confirmed this identification through the analysis of a synthetic standard of PFBHAderivatized cyanoformaldehyde. Cyanoformaldehyde in its pure, isolated form proved to be unstable, necessitating the direct synthesis of its PFBHA derivative.
Although we purchased and synthesized many standards, there are still a few DBPs shown in Figure 2 whose structures remain unknown. Most notable of these are the unknown C7-isomers, whose derivatized molecular weights were determined to be 309 and whose molecular formulas were determined to be C14H16NOF5. The three chromatographic peaks in Figure 2 (around retention time of 22 min) are believed to be due to two compounds, as the first of these chromatographic peaks shows a mass spectrum that is distinctly different from the other two, which are identical (likely syn and anti isomers of one compound). All three sets of mass spectra show an intense fragment ion at m/z 253, which indicates that these compounds are probably ketones (compare with other ketones in Table 2). Because their spectra and retention times do not match any of the other possible isomers in Table 2, a possible assignment for the first compound can be proposed: 4-methyl-2-hexanone. This structure is consistent with ions present in the unknown’s mass spectrum (relatively strong loss of 56 Da and a loss of 28 Da). The second compound does not show any prominent fragment ions (other than m/z 253, which distinguishes it as a probable ketone). Therefore, it is impossible to determine its identity without a standard.
In addition to the monocarbonyls observed, there were also dicarbonyls, including some that have not been previously observed. These dicarbonyls include glyoxal (MW 448), methyl glyoxal (2-ketopropanal) (MW 462), 2,3-butanedione (dimethylglyoxal) (MW 476), an isomer of 2,3-butanedione (MW 476), a C5-dicarbonyl (MW 490), and 5-ketohexanal

(MW 504). CI-MS was used to confirm these molecular weight assignments for PFBHA derivatives. Glyoxal and methylglyoxal are well-documented in the literature as ozone DBPs. In addition to observing these compounds in the diderivatized forms (at each carbonyl group), small chromatographic peaks were also observed, representing their monoderivatized forms (molecular formulas of C9H4NO2F5 and C10H6NO2F5, at molecular weights of 253 and 267, respectively, Figure 2). The identification of the remaining dicarbonyls was extremely difficult as there were few MS ions present at high mass to permit their structural identification. Other than the presence of the molecular ion, whose composition could be determined by high-resolution MS, the dominant ions mostly involved the loss of one of the pentafluorobenzyl groups, which provided no useful structural information (e.g., m/z 279 for the MW 490 compound, and m/z 307 for the MW 504 compound). A MW 476 dicarbonyl was previously observed by Coleman et al. (6) and was reported as “ethylglyoxal”, with a precise structural assignment not given. We observed two different compounds with this molecular weight, one of which was confirmed to be 2,3-butanedione, from the analysis of a standard, but the other isomer was not determined. There are, however, only four remaining possible structures for this 4-carbon dicarbonyl: 1,4-butanedial, 2-methyl-1,3-propanedial, 2-keto-1-butanal, and 3-keto-1butanal. The MW 490 dicarbonyl derivative has not been previously reported. From the CI-MS data, a five-carbon dicarbonyl structure is indicated (with no oxygen-containing substituents). However, beyond that information, there is no information to distinguish whether it is a dialdehyde, ketoaldehyde, or diketone. We have not yet been able to obtain synthesized standards to determine the identity. The six-carbon dicarbonyl (MW 504) has also been previously observed by Coleman et al. (6) but was given a nonprecise tentative identification of “hexanedione”. The formula obtained by high-resolution MS of C20H14N2O2F10 was consistent with a derivatized, aliphatic dicarbonyl with no OH or COOH groups present. With no other spectral information available, we synthesized a possible candidate compound, 5-ketohexanal, which showed a match of its mass spectra and GC retention time to the unknown in the drinking
water sample. Our 5-ketohexanal standard exhibited two chromatographic peaks (multiple isomers likely coelute) that matched the two peaks in the unknown sample.
Ozone-Chlorine and Ozone-Chloramine Treatments
THMs and HAAs were observed when secondary chlorine or chloramine was applied following ozonation. This is consistent with previous studies (4, 25). Details about the concentrations found for the ozone-chlorine, ozonechloramine, chlorine, and chloramine can be obtained from the Supporting Information. Briefly, secondary treatment with chlorine or chloramine (following ozonation) produced lower levels of THMs and HAAs relative to treatment with only chlorine or chloramine for our samples. This effect was also noticed for other halogenated DBPs shown in Table 1 and was evident from the TOX data (further details in Supporting Information). This effect has also been observed previously by others (4, 25). Exceptions to this are some of the brominated DBPs (including bromoform, dibromochloromethane, and dibromoacetic acid) that were observed at higher levels with ozone-chlorine and ozone-chloramine than for chlorine or chloramine treatment alone. Both chlorine (or chloramine) and ozone can oxidize Br- ion to form hypobromous acid (HOBr), which in turn reacts with dissolved natural organic matter to form brominated DBPs (5, 26, 27). Thus, the higher levels of brominated DBPs observed for ozone-chlorine or ozone-chloramine treatments may be due to greater formation of HOBr. In comparing the results of the different secondary disinfectants, concentrations were generally lower for halogenated DBPs from ozone-chloramine than from ozone-chlorine. This was also evidenced by a significantly lower TOX for ozone-chloramine as compared to ozone-chlorine (average TOX of 40 and 201 μg/L, respectively). Table 1 lists the halogenated DBPs that were identified when secondary chlorine or chloramine was applied following ozonation. Among the DBPs identified were haloaldehydes, haloacids, haloalkanes, haloacetonitriles, halopropanones, haloacetates, haloketones, halo alcohols, and halonitromethanes. Most of these compounds were also formed at the same or higher levels by chlorine or chloramine treatment

alone, indicating that their formation did not involve significant reaction with ozone. A compound that is notably absent from Table 1 is MX [3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone]. Because MX has been reported as a byproduct of chlorine and chloramine (9) and it is a potentially hazardous compound (28), we carefully looked for it in our samples, especially those samples treated with secondary chlorine or chloramine. To be sure that it was not obscured by other coeluting compounds, we constructed ion chromatograms with significant mass spectral ions of MX that would allow it to be revealed among coeluting compounds. It is possible that MX was actually present but was below our limit of detection, which would indicate a low nanogram per liter upper bound concentration if it were present.
PFBHA derivatization was beneficial in identifying two of the chlorinated DBPs observed with ozone-chlorine or ozone-chloramine treatmentssdichloroacetaldehyde and 1,1-dichloropropanone (Table 1). Dichloroacetaldehyde was observed only when PFBHA derivatization was used. This is probably due to the highly polar nature of this molecule and the difficulty in extracting it from water without prior derivatization. 1,1-Dichloropropanone was present in both the PFBHA-derivatized sample and in the resin extracts but was much easier to distinguish in the PFBHA-derivatized sample. The GC/MS chromatograms of the PFBHA-derivatived samples were less complex than those of the resin extracts (without derivatization) and had fewer overlapping peaks to obscure the detection of DBPs.
Dichloroacetaldehyde and 1,1-dichloropropanone along with compounds tentatively identified as 2-chloro-2-methylpropanal and 2-bromo-2-methylpropanal are unusual because they appear to be formed at higher levels in the ozonechlorine and ozone-chloramine samples than in samples treated with chlorine or chloramine alone. Dichloroacetaldehyde was present in the ozone-chlorine and ozonechloramine samples at levels 20 times higher than samples treated with only chlorine or chloramine. 1,1-Dichloropropanone, 2-chloro-2-methylpropanal, and 2-bromo-2-methylpropanal were present at levels 2 times greater than for chlorine or chloramine treatment alone. Therefore, it appears that the combination of ozone and chlorine or chloramine is important in their formation. As these compounds were not found from ozone treatment alone, it is possible that their formation is due to the reaction of secondary chlorine or chloramine with a preformed ozone byproduct.
Biofiltration. Because some ozone treatment plants use biofiltration to remove aldehydes and other assimilable organic carbon (AOC) from ozonated water, biofiltration was addressed. For the round 4 samples collected in September 1996, biofiltered samples were collected for water treated with ozone and secondary chlorine. Specifically, ozonated water was passed through a biologically active dual media filter (sand and anthracite). The empty bed contact time for this filter was 6 min, and the flow rate was 6 L/min. After biofiltration, this water was treated with secondary chlorine, analyzed, and compared to non-biofiltered water treated with the same disinfectants (ozone + chlorine). The degree of biofiltration achieved was measured by total AOC removal, as measured by the P. fluorescens strain P-17 and Spirillum strain NOX method (22). Individual chemical removals were determined by analyzing GC/MS data. Specifically, GC/MS peak areas were compared for biofiltered and non-biofiltered samples, and percent removal of the different chemicals was determined. Total AOC measurements indicated an AOC for the non-biofiltered ozone + chlorine sample of 668 μg of C equiv/L and an AOC of 338 μg of C equiv/L for the corresponding biofiltered sample. Thus, approximately 50% of the AOC was removed by biofiltration.
Individual chemicals and their percent removals due to biofiltration are available in the Supporting Information. Briefly, carboxylic acids, which were initially present at levels higher than other DBPs, represented the major class of chemicals removed by biofiltration. The removal of individual carboxylic acids ranged from 45 to 90%. Other researchers have reported removals of carboxylic acids with biofiltration (29). For the aldehydes, ketones, and aldo and keto acids that were present at levels high enough to permit the determination of biofiltration removals, reasonably good removals were observed (35-95%). Previous studies have also shown good removals of aldehydes and aldo and keto acids (29-33).
