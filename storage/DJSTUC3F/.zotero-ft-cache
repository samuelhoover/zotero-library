ABSTRACT: The biological activity of chitosans depends on their degree of polymerization (DP) and degree of acetylation (DA). However, information could also be carried by the pattern of acetylation (PA): the sequence of β-1,4-linked glucosamine (deacetylated/D) and Nacetylglucosamine (acetylated/A) units. To address this hypothesis, we prepared partially acetylated chitosan oligosaccharides from a chitosan polymer (DA = 35%, DPw = 905) using
recombinant chitosan hydrolases with distinct substrate and cleavage specificities. The mixtures were separated into fractions DP4−DP12, which were tested for elicitor and priming activities in rice cells. We confirmed that both activities were influenced by DP, but also observed apparent DA-dependent priming activity, with the ADDD+DADD fraction proving remarkably effective. We then compared all four monoacetylated tetramers prepared using different chitin deacetylases and observed significant differences in priming activity. This demonstrates for the first time that PA influences the biological activity of chitosans, which can now be recognized as bona f ide information-carrying molecules.

INTRODUCTION
Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide, comprising β-1,4-linked Dglucosamine (GlcN) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc)
residues, produced by many fungi.1 Commercially, it is produced by alkaline deacetylation of chitin, one of the most abundant biopolymers found e.g. in fungal cell walls and
exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects.2 Chitosan is associated with antimicrobial, wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, immuno-stimulatory, and anticarcinogenic activities and can also
elicit defense responses in plants.2,3 Many of these activities can be traced to partially acetylated chitosan oligosaccharides (paCOS) released from chitosan by sequence-dependent
chitosan hydrolases.2,4 The precise activity of paCOS is determined by the oligosaccharide chain length, also known as the degree of polymerization (DP), and the relative abundance of GlcNAc residues, also known as the degree of acetylation (DA). However, information could also be carried by the sequence of GlcN and GlcNAc residues along the linear chain, which is known as the pattern of acetylation (PA) and is often represented using a simplified convention in which A and D represent the acetylated (GlcNAc) and deacetylated (GlcN) residues, respectively. This long-standing hypothesis is based on the previous identification of other oligosaccharides with
pattern-specific activities in animals5 and plants.6,7 It is difficult to test the above-mentioned hypothesis because the separation of paCOS isomers differing only in PA is not yet
feasible, at least on a preparative scale.2,8,9 Short-chain paCOS with a defined PA can be produced in small amounts by chemical synthesis, but this becomes more challenging and
expensive as the DP increases.2,8 A simpler approach to produce at least partially defined paCOS mixtures is the application of sequence-dependent chitosan hydrolases such as the chitinases and chitosanases that many organisms use as defense-related or general metabolic enzymes,10,11 combined if necessary with one or more regioselective chitin deacetylases.12,13 These are collectively known as chitin and chitosan modifying enzymes (CCMEs). Plants can detect chitin (and possibly also chitosans) as elicitors of defense responses via so-called pattern recognition receptors.14 Elicitors are often described as pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that induce PAMPtriggered immunity as part of local resistance to fend off invaders at the infection site. However, PAMPs can also instruct plant cells to enter a state of elevated alertness, known as priming.15 Pretreatment with priming-active molecules such as salicylic acid and certain bacterial and algal polysaccharides enhances the elicitor-induced rapid generation of H2O2 during an oxidative burst, which is known to trigger primary defense responses in plants.16,17 Here we exploited the well-known ability of paCOS to induce H2O2 production in plants18,19 to compare the elicitor and priming activity of different paCOS isomers in rice cell

suspension cultures. A sequence of enzymatic steps using CCMEs with defined cleavage and deacetylation mechanisms was developed to obtain pure paCOS differing in DP, DA, and
PA.2,13,20 We found that the ability of a monoacetylated chitosan tetramer to induce priming in rice cells was dependent on the position of the GlcNAc residue, demonstrating for the first time that the PA plays a key role in the
biological activity of chitosans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid Construction and Transformation. Unless otherwise indicated, cloning steps were carried out using previously reported
protocols.21 The bspcsn gene encoding the GH8 (class III) Chitosa
nase BspCSN (MN) from Bacillus sp. MN22 was inserted into vector
pET-22b(+)::StrepIIC (Novagen) as described23 resulting in the construct pET-22b::BspCSN-StrepIIC. The blichi gene encoding the B. licheniformis GH18 Chitinase was generated as previously
described24 before inserting the StrepII-tag coding sequence directly upstream of the C-terminal His6 tag. The plasmid was amplified using
forward primer His-StrepII_for (5′-Pho-AGG ATG TGA CCA GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG CTC-3′) and reverse primer HisStrepII_rev (5′-Pho-CAA TTT GAA AAA TAG GAT CCG GCT GCT AAC AAA G-3′) each providing one 5′ overhanging part of the StrepII-tag sequence (shown in italics). The products were digested with DpnI for 30 min at 37 °C to destroy methylated parental plasmid DNA, and then separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The 7.5kb product was excised and, after cleanup, was religated using T4 Rapid Ligase to yield pET-22b::BliCHI-His6-StrepIIC. The plasmids
were verified by sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). The other CCME genes were cloned previously (details provided in Table S1).
Bacterial Cultivation, Heterologous Expression, Enzyme Purification, and Analysis. The cultivation of Escherichia coli strains carrying the pET-22b(+)::StrepIIC vector constructs, the induction of expression, protein purification, and analysis by SDS-PAGE and
Western blotting were carried out as previously described.23 After purification, the enzymes were rebuffered in 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 5.2) or 50 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate (pH 8.0).
Chemical Re-Acetylation of Chitosan. Raw chitosan polymer (DPw = 905, determined using HP-SEC-RI-MALLS; DA = 2%, determined using proton NMR) originating from shrimp shell chitin was kindly provided by Dominique Gillet (Mahtani Chitosan). This was dissolved in an aqueous acetic acid solution and purified by successive filtration and extensive washing in deionized water involving repeated precipitation with 25% ammonia and centrifugation at 10 000 × g, before chitosan (DA = 35%) was prepared by partial re-N-acetylation using acetic anhydride in 1,2-propanediol, as
previously described.25 The DA of the resulting chitosan was determined by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrosco
py.26 Spectra were recorded on a Bruker UltraShield spectrometer at 300 MHz with 128 scans. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving 0.75 mg of chitosan in 0.5 mL of 99.99% D2O plus 2 μL of 35% (w/v) DCl solution and were analyzed at the Institute for Organic Chemistry, University of Münster. The assignment of the signal peaks was deduced from 1H NMR reference data for chitosan
oligomers.27 The DA was calculated as previously described.28
Enzymatic Depolymerization. Chitosan (DA = 35%) was hydrolyzed using chitinases and chitosanases. For oxidative burst experiments, hydrolysis was performed with a substrate concentration of 1 mg/mL in 25 mM ammonium acetate (pH 5.5) and an enzymeto-substrate mass ratio of 1:1000 for 48 h at 37 °C. The hydrolysates were filtered using Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators with a 10 kDa MWCO polyether sulfone membrane (Sartorius). The filtrates were lyophilized overnight, dissolved in sterile water to the previous concentration, and stored at 4 °C. For preparative SEC, chitosan (5 mg/mL) was processed under the same conditions. However, these hydrolysates were concentrated in ammonium acetate buffer to a volume of 5 mL and filtered using a membrane with a pore size of 0.22 μm. The number-average degree of polymerization (DPn) of the
hydrolysates was determined by gel permeation chromatography on a high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) system
(PSS Polymer Standards Service) as previously described.29
High-Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HP-TLC). Chitosan hydrolysates (20 μg) or purified paCOS (3−5 μg) were dissolved in 10 μL of water and applied to HP-TLC silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck) using an automatic TLC sampler 4 (Camag). The oligomeric products were separated in a glass chamber using 5:4:2:1 butanol/methanol/ammonia (25%)/water as a solvent, and the airdried plate was then sprayed with 30% (w/v) ammonium hydrogen sulfate and kept in an oven at 200 °C or treated with a heat gun to
visualize the bands.30 We applied 4 μL of GlcN or GlcNAc standard solution as markers, each containing 0.25 mg/mL per standard molecule (monomer to hexamer).
Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Samples were prepared by mixing 0.5 μL of paCOS solution (1 mg/mL) with 0.5 μL of matrix (10 mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) in 1:1 water/ acetonitrile) on a target plate. The samples were gently dried under a cold air stream and analyzed using an Autoflex Speed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a SmartBeam NdYAG laser (λ = 355 nm). The instrument was operated in positive acquisition mode with an acceleration voltage of 25 kV, pulsed ion extraction of 40 ns, and an acquisition range of m/z 400−4000. Data were collected by averaging laser shots with a pulse rate of 30 Hz for 60 s and the lowest laser energy necessary to obtain sufficient signalto-noise ratios. Mass spectra were analyzed using Compass DataAnalysis v4.1 (Bruker).
Preparative SEC and Lyophilization of Fractionated paCOS. The paCOS mixtures were separated according to DP on a SECcurity GPC System (PSS Polymer Standards Service) consisting of three HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 30 preparatory grade columns (GE Healthcare) coupled to a differential refractometer (Agilent 1260 Infinity) and a fraction collector FRAC-200 (Pharmacia). Up to 30 mg/mL paCOS mixture per run was injected into a loop with a capacity of 5 mL and separated for 22 h. Ammonium acetate buffer (0.15 M, pH 4.5) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.65 mL/min. After 11 h, fractions were collected every 7 min. Data were recorded using WinGPC UniChrom software, and fractions were pooled accordingly. The fraction pools were freeze-dried overnight. The lyophilizates were dissolved in 2 mL of water and freeze-dried again. This step was carried out three times in total to remove residual ammonium acetate, leaving a powdery to fluffy, whitish solid which was stored at room temperature in a desiccator containing silica gel beads.
Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Electro
spray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-ELSD-ESI-MS1) Analysis. The paCOS were analyzed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000RS UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an evaporative light scattering detector (Model Sedex 90LT, Sedere) and an amaZon speed ESI-MSn-detector (Bruker Daltonics) as previously
described.12 Briefly, paCOS were separated by HILIC using a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH Amide column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm) combined with a Waters VanGuard precolumn (1.7 mm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm). The flow rate was set to 0.4 mL/min, and the column oven temperature was 35 °C. Sample aliquots of 1 μL containing 0.5−1 μg of paCOS were injected into the system using an autosampler. Samples were eluted from the column with a gradient of solvent A (80:20 acetonitrile/water) and B (20:80 acetonitrile/water). Both solvents contained 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate. The samples were separated for 15 min using the following elution profile: 0−2.5 min isocratic 100% A; 2.5−12.5 min linear from 0% to 75% B; 12.5−13.5 min column re-equilibration linear from 75% to 0% B; 13.5−15 min isocratic 100% A. For quick analysis, samples were separated for 5.5 min at 0.8 mL/min and 75 °C using the following elution profile: 0−0.8 min isocratic 100% A; 0.8−3.3 min linear from 0% to 70% B; 3.3−4.3 min column re-equilibration linear from 70% to 0% B; 4.3−5.5 min isocratic 100% A. The instrument was operated in positive mode with a capillary voltage of 4 kV, an endplate offset voltage of 500 V, a nebulizer pressure of 15 psi, a dry gas

flow rate of 8 l/min, and a dry temperature of 200 °C. Mass spectra acquired over the scan range m/z 50−2000 in enhanced resolution scan mode were analyzed using Data Analysis v4.1 (Bruker). The mass precision of the instrument was ±0.15 m/z.
Semi-preparative Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC). The paCOS were separated according to DA on
an Ä KTA HPLC system (GE Healthcare) using a Phenomenex Luna 5 μm CN column (100 Å, 250 mm × 10 mm) combined with a Phenomenex SecurityGuard SemiPrep Cartridge (10 mm × 10 mm)
as previously described.31 Sample aliquots (250 μL) with concentrations of 8−40 mg/mL (considering the impaired solubility of higher DPs and DAs at high acetonitrile concentrations) were injected into a loop. The paCOS were eluted from the column with a gradient of eluent A (90:10 acetonitrile/water) and B (10:90 acetonitrile/ water), both containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 15 mM ammonium formate. The flow rate was 2 mL/min, and the column oven temperature was 40 °C. The separation was achieved over a period of 40 min using the following elution profile: sample influx 0− 5 min isocratic 100% A; 5−30 min linear from 0% to 40% B; 30−30.1 min linear from 40% to 70% B; 30.1−35 min 70% B; 35−35.1 min column re-equilibration linear from 70% to 0% B, 35.1−40 min isocratic 100% A. Eluted paCOS were detected by UV absorption spectrophotometry (λ1 = 203 nm; λ2 = 210 nm). Oligomer fractions were pooled and subsequently dried using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C.
Production and Enzymatic Deacetylation of Tetra-N-Acetyl Chitotetraose and Knockout of BspCSN DP4 Fraction. To produce substrate AAAA, full N-acetylation of chitosan oligomers was achieved using a cautious three-stage reaction in 1:1 methanol/water. Chitosan (DA = 35%, 200 mg) was depolymerized using BliCHI as already described, lyophilized, and resuspended in 10 mL of 100 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate (pH 7.9) plus 8 mL of methanol. The required volume of acetic anhydride to obtain a DA of 100% was
calculated,25 mixed with 2 mL of methanol and then added slowly with gentle, bubble-free stirring to the oligomeric chitosan. The suspension was incubated with continuous gentle stirring at room temperature overnight and centrifuged at 13 000 × g for 10 min to eliminate the insoluble fraction, and the clear supernatant was lyophilized. The procedure was carried out three times in total, the last two times using half of the calculated volume of acetic anhydride to avoid O-acetylation and 50 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate to limit the salinity. After freeze-drying, the N-acetylated COS were dissolved in water and purified by preparative SEC as described above. The resulting substrate AAAA was dissolved in 25 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer (pH 8.0) at a concentration of 2 mg/mL prior to the enzymatic treatments. Singly, doubly, and triply deacetylated tetramers were produced using different deacetylases alone or in combination and analyzed by UHPLC-ELSD-ESI-MS as described above. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C and 180 rpm overnight with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:20 for NodB (nodulation gene B (from Rhizobium sp. GRH2) encoded CDA) and PgtCDA (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici CDA), and 1:100 for VcCDA and PesCDA in the following order for optimized substrate turnover. For single deacetylation, 2 mg of AAAA were incubated with NodB, and 10 mg with VcCDA or PesCDA to generate DAAA, ADAA, and AADA. For double deacetylation, each 4 mg amount from the reactions with VcCDA and PesCDA was treated separately with NodB, leading to DADA and DDAA. Another 4 mg of AAAA digested with PesCDA were combined with VcCDA, resulting in ADDA. To obtain AADD, 10 mg of AAAA were treated with PgtCDA. For triple deacetylation, 2 mg of AAAA incubated with PesCDA and VcCDA were mixed with NodB to generate DDDA. Each 2 mg amount of AAAA digested with PgtCDA was combined with NodB or VcCDA to produce DADD and ADDD, respectively. The last monoacetylated tetramer with the pattern DDAD was obtained using PesCDA in
reverse mode.20 For knockout studies, the BspCSN-produced paCOS tetramer containing ADDD and DADD was incubated with NodB and/or VcCDA in 25 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer (pH 8.0) with a substrate concentration of 1 mg/mL and an enzyme− substrate ratio of 1:10 at 37 °C for 1 h. After each deacetylation step,
the samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 × g using 3 kDa MWCO Vivaspin 2 concentrators (Sartorius) to remove the enzymes and stop the reaction. For the removal of buffer, samples were lyophilized overnight. The dried samples were resuspended in 50% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile for further purification by HILIC.
UHPLC-ELSD-ESI-MS2 Sequencing for PA Determination. The PA of paCOS was assessed by MS2 sequencing involving an 18O
labeling method.20,32 Briefly, 10 μg of dry paCOS were dissolved in 5 μL of H218O (Euriso-top) containing 0.1% formic acid and incubated
for 6 h at 70 °C. The samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge at 1200 rpm and 30 °C for 30 min, dissolved in 10 μL of H218O
containing 0.1% formic acid, and incubated at 70 °C overnight to label the reducing ends. To analyze the PA, 2 μL of the 18O-labeled sample (0.5−1 μg/μL) were separated by UHPLC-ELSD-ESI-MS as described above, with the target mass set to 840 (m/z). Targets of m/ z 791.32, 749.31, and 707.30 were isolated at a width of 1.0 m/z. Enhanced fragmentation was achieved using a collision-induced dissociation energy gradient (80−120%) and a dissociation delay of 20 ms. MS2 spectra acquired over the scan range m/z 50−2000 were analyzed using Data Analysis v4.1.
Cultivation and Maintenance of Rice Cell Suspension Cultures. Four replicate lines of rice cell cultures were grown in 50
mL of MS medium33 supplemented with 30 g/L sucrose and 1 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in the dark with constant agitation on
a rotary shaker at 26 °C and 120 rpm.34,35 The cells were transferred to fresh culture medium every 7 days by passing the cells gently through a plain-woven metal strainer (18 mesh, 0.9 mm aperture) to produce fine cell aggregates. For oxidative burst experiments, the assay medium (pH 5.8) was composed of 5% (v/v) culture medium and 30 g/L sucrose in 10 mM MES buffer.
Oxidative Burst Measurements for the Assessment of Elicitor and Priming Activities. The release of H2O2 was measured
in a Lumat LB 9501/16 luminometer (Berthold) using a modified
luminol-dependent chemiluminescence method.36,37 Prior to measurement, cells were gently separated from the culture medium using a sintered glass filter 3−4 days after subculturing. Cell aliquots (300 mg) were resuspended in 5 mL of assay medium filled into each cavity of a sterile CELLSTAR 6-well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One) and incubated in the dark on a rotary shaker at 23 °C and 120 rpm. For priming studies, cells were pretreated with the required volumes of paCOS stock solutions (0.5 mM; 1 mg/mL for hydrolysates) after 2 h of adaptation to the new culture conditions. After another 3 h of incubation as above, an oxidative burst was triggered by adding the standard elicitor hydrogen fluoride (HF)-chitosan (DP = 400, DA = 14%) produced from commercial chitosan (Sigma-Aldrich) as
previously described,38 at concentrations with minor to no elicitor activity (1−10 μg/mL). For elicitor studies, samples were added to
naïve cells 5 h after seeding. Sterile deionized water was used as negative priming and elicitor controls. Immediately after pipetting elicitor samples or HF-chitosan, the emission of H2O2 was monitored.
At each time of measurement, 200 μL of cell suspension were mixed with 700 μL of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.9). The light reaction was activated by adding 100 μL of 1.2 mM luminol and 100 μL of 14 mM potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), and was detected over an integration time of 10 s at 430 nm. The chemiluminescence value was presented as relative light units (RLUs) proportional to the
amount of H2O2 released.

RESULTS
Preparation and Characterization of paCOS. In order to determine the role of PA on the biological activity of paCOS, we converted a partially acetylated chitosan polymer (DA = 35%) into oligomers with similar or identical properties in terms of DP and DA but with characteristically distinct acetylation patterns. This was achieved by incubating the polymer with different CCMEs, namely a glycoside hydrolase
family 8 (GH8) Chitosanase from Bacillus sp. (BspCSN)22 and
a GH18 Chitinase from Bacillus licheniformis (BliCHI).24 The products were separated by size-exclusion chromatography

(SEC) (Figure S1A and B) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and mass spectrometry (MS), revealing that the resulting fractions were well separated in terms of DP, and each fraction comprised a mixture of oligomers differing in DA (Figure S1C and D, Table S2, and Figure S2). As expected, the DA was slightly higher for the oligomers produced by the Chitosanase than for those produced by the Chitinase. Furthermore, because BspCSN exclusively hydrolyzes GlcN−GlcN or, to a lesser extent, GlcN−GlcNAc linkages,39 whereas BliCHI exclusively hydrolyzes GlcNAc−GlcNAc or, to a lesser extent, GlcNAc-GlcN
linkages,40 the PA of oligomers equivalent in DP and DA should differ, with GlcN units dominating the ends of the Chitosanase products and GlcNAc units dominating the ends of the Chitinase products. The further incubation of purified oligomers with the same enzyme used for production showed no further change, confirming that the oligomers in each case represented the final hydrolysis products (Figure S3).
Priming and Elicitor Activity of Purified paCOS. We initially tested the unresolved mixtures of oligomeric products obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis for elicitor activity in rice

cells by recording the induction of a transient oxidative burst. The Chitosanase products demonstrated strong elicitor activity, but the Chitinase products were inactive (Figure 1A, left). We then tested the tetramer (DP4), octamer (DP8), and dodecamer (DP12) fractions of the Chitosanase products prepared by SEC, and dose−response curves revealed that the elicitor activity increased with the DP, as expected (Figure 1A, right). Similarly, only the Chitosanase products showed priming activity when rice cells were pretreated with the complete mixtures of oligomeric products 3 h before the oxidative burst was triggered by the addition of a chitosan polymer (DP = 400, DA = 14%) as an elicitor (Figure 1B, left). Following fractionation by SEC, dose−response curves revealed that priming activity increased with the DP, and the DP12 fraction showed strong priming activity even at concentrations as low as 30 nM (Figure 1B, right). When all fractions were tested at the same concentration (2 μM), there was a clear relationship between the priming activity and DP, although the DP4 fraction was more active than DP5 and DP6, and similar in activity to DP8 (Figure 2). To determine the minimal structural requirements for the priming activity we observed, we compared the DP4 fractions obtained from the Chitinase and Chitosanase hydrolysis of the DA = 35% chitosan polymer. The Chitinase products (no priming activity) yielded a mixture of monoacetylated and double-acetylated tetramers, whereas the Chitosanase products (strong DP-dependent priming activity) yielded only monoacetylated tetramers (Figure 3A). MS2 analysis revealed that the monoacetylated tetramers produced by the Chitinase comprised only one molecular species: DDDA, with the acetyl group at the reducing end, as expected for a GH18 Chitinase (Figure 3C). In contrast, the Chitosanase-derived tetramers contained two different monoacetylated species, namely ADDD and DADD in a ratio of about 3:2, again as expected
for this enzyme.39 Pure DDDA was recovered from the Chitinase product by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) (Figure 3B). We then tested the priming activity of Chitosanase-derived ADDD+DADD, Chitinasederived DDDA, and the standards AAAA and DDDD. The standards were mostly inactive (AAAA showed minimal priming activity in some experiments), but among the monoacetylated tetramers, only the Chitosanase-derived mixture of ADDD and DADD showed strong priming activity, whereas the Chitinase-derived DDDA was inactive (Figure 4). This provided the first evidence of PA-dependent activity in a chitosan oligomer.
Priming Activity of Mono-acetylated Chitosan Tetramers. Given that mixtures of isomeric chitosan oligomers identical in DP and DA but differing in PA cannot easily be separated, we designed an alternative “enzymatic knockout” approach to find out which of the two monoacetylated Chitosanase products (ADDD or DADD) was responsible for the priming activity observed above. We therefore digested the fraction with one of two regioselective bacterial chitin deacetylases: NodB from Rhizobium sp. GRH2 or VcCDA from Vibrio cholerae. NodB specifically deacetylates residues at
the nonreducing end of chitin and chitosan oligomers,12,20,41 thus converting ADDD into the inactive DDDD but leaving DADD intact. In contrast, VcCDA specifically deacetylates the
unit adjacent to the nonreducing end,12,20,42 thus converting DADD into DDDD but leaving ADDD intact. A double knockout using both enzymes completely converted the mixture to DDDD and served as a negative control. The
success of these treatments was verified by MS (Figure 5A and B). When the treated fractions were tested for priming activity,

both single knockouts showed lower activity than the original mixture, but both were still active, suggesting that the bioactivity of the tetrameric Chitosanase product was due to the additive effects of ADDD and DADD (Figure 5C and D). As expected, the fully deacetylated product of the double knockout showed no priming activity. These results showed that two of the four possible monoacetylated chitosan tetramers possess priming activity and one does not, further supporting the role of PA in the bioactivity of chitosan oligomers. To test the hypothesis more rigorously, we used VcCDA and NodB along with two additional chitin deacetylases to convert fully acetylated chitin oligomers (Figure S6) into defined partially acetylated derivatives. The chitin deacetylase from the fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (PgtCDA) removes all acetyl groups from chitin except those on the nonreducing end residue and its neighbor, thus converting a chitin tetramer (AAAA) into the
double-acetylated chitosan tetramer AADD.43 Further treatment of this product with VcCDA or NodB then produces the monoacetylated tetramers ADDD and DADD, respectively. The chitin deacetylase from the fungus Pestalotiopsis sp. (PesCDA) not only acts similarly to PgtCDA but also leaves the reducing end unit acetylated, thus converting chitin
(AAAA) into the triple-acetylated tetramer AADA.44 The further treatment of this product with VcCDA and NodB thus produces the monoacetylated tetramer DDDA. We applied all possible combinations of the four enzymes to produce a diverse set of chitosan tetramers differing in DA and PA, applied HILIC as a final purification step if necessary, and verified the success of each reaction by MS (Figure 6A,C,D and Figure S7). When these pure and defined paCOS were tested for priming activity in rice cells, the monoacetylated tetramers ADDD and (to a lesser extent) DADD were active, but DDDA was almost inactive. The double-acetylated tetramer AADD had low priming activity (comparable to DADD), but the triple-acetylated tetramers DAAA, ADAA, and AADA were all inactive (Figure S8). The most challenging monoacetylated
tetramer was DDAD, which was ultimately produced using PesCDA in reverse mode, given that the regioselectivity of the enzyme is retained even when N-acetylating the fully
deacetylated glucosamine tetramer.20 Having confirmed the successful synthesis of DDAD by MS (Figure 6B), we were then able to compare the priming activities of all four monoacetylated chitosan tetramers. We found that priming activity correlated with the position of the acetyl group: the closer the acetyl group was to the nonreducing end, the higher the priming activity of the chitosan tetramer (Figure 6E and
F■). DISCUSSION
Chitosan oligomers are associated with a wide range of biological activities that are strongly influenced by the DP and
DA.3 The role of these factors is unsurprising because they determine the overall size/molecular weight (DP) and overall charge of the molecule (DA). However, it has long been proposed that the sequence of acetylated and deacetylated residues along the linear oligomer backbone can also influence biological activity, given earlier studies reporting the pattern
specific activities of other carbohydrate structures.5,45 In plants for example, the antiauxin activity of the plant cell wall polysaccharide xyloglucan was resolved to a nonamer with
defined side chains.7 Another highly relevant example from plants is the ability of β-glucan fragments derived from fungal cell walls to induce phytoalexin synthesis in soybean only if a
particular branching motif is present.6 If the PA were found to play a role in the biological activity of chitosan oligomers, they would join a small family of natural molecules including nucleic acids and proteins that have the ability to carry information as a linear sequence. It has not been possible to address this chitosan hypothesis until recently because there was no reliable method to prepare pure fractions of paCOS isomers in quantities sufficient for testing. While fully de-N-acetylated GlcN oligomers and fully N-acetylated GlcNAc oligomers can be produced chemically using relatively facile approaches, total synthesis of paCOS

with defined PA is highly demanding and possible for very small oligomers and at very low yields only.46 In contrast, the preparation of heterogeneous mixtures of paCOS via acidic depolymerization is straightforward, and these can be fractionated by molecular size/weight (DP) and charge (DA) using various common laboratory techniques, but this still leaves unresolved mixtures with different acetylation patterns.2,46 Here, we addressed this challenge by using different combinations of CCMEs, including enzymes which selectively digest or selectively acetylate/deacetylate chitin/chitosan in a pattern-dependent manner, then combining them with standard size/charge-based fractionation methods to prepare pure
fractions of chitosan tetramers, allowing the first comprehensive analysis of each pure isomer for its biological activity. By systematically testing all the different acetylation patterns in our set of paCOS isomers, we found that monoacetylated chitosan tetramers cause defense priming in rice cells when the single acetyl group is at or next to the nonreducing end unit, but not if it is at or next to the reducing end unit. This is the first report providing experimental evidence for the impact of PA on the bioactivity of chitosans, and although we focused on elicitation and priming in plant cells as an amenable test system, the availability of near-complete sets of chitosan oligomers will allow similar tests to be conducted in animal

and human cells in the context of wound-healing or the development of new therapeutic approaches for cancer and
autoimmune diseases.47−49 The cellular response to chitosans is likely to involve ligand-binding proteins such as receptor-like kinases, growth factors, and transcription factors, which
recognize molecular patterns,50−53 and the poor reproducibility in earlier bioactivity studies probably reflects the uncertain isomeric composition of the test compounds. The availability of strategies to produce pure isomers will provide an important tool for such studies in the future. Similarly, the exposure of plants to chitosans can elicit responses such as phytoalexin production, lignification, or the hypersensitive
response/programmed cell death,54 but it is not clear how such acute resistance reactions can result in the observed long-term
protection from disease.55 This hinders the development of agricultural products based on chitosans. One possibility is that certain chitosans induce priming activity; i.e., chitosan pretreatment can induce a state of alertness that enables plants to react more quickly and more strongly following the
detection of a pathogen.56 The priming activity of chitosans was demonstrated for the first time herein and was shown to depend on the DP, DA, and PA. This insight into the mechanism of chitosans in plant defense should enable further, more-targeted studies and the development of novel plant protection products. Surprisingly, we found that paCOS produced by a Chitosanase showed priming activity whereas paCOS produced by a Chitinase did not. Plants are known to produce and secrete multiple chitinases, particularly during microbial
infections,57 but plant chitosanases are rare, suggesting they lack the ability to generate priming-active paCOS from the cell
walls of invading fungi.58 Indeed, the conversion of surfaceexposed chitin into chitosan is thought to represent an evolutionary adaptation allowing pathogenic fungi to evade the
chitin-based immune system of plants.1,22 However, endo
phytic fungi in plants are a rich source of chitosanases,59 and it is tempting to speculate that this ability may be one of the benefits the host plant gains from the presence of the endophytes. As expected, the elicitor and priming activities of the Chitosanase products increased with increasing DP, as shown repeatedly for the elicitor activities of chitin and chitosan
oligomers.60,61 The chitin receptor complex OsCERK1 (Oryza sativa chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1)/CEBiP (chitin elicitor binding protein) in rice, which is thought to be activated by
chitin heptamer-induced dimerization,62,63 is known for its instant elicitation of reactive oxygen species. Perception by this receptor may therefore be responsible for the observed elicitor activities of larger paCOS produced by Chitosanase, given their higher DA compared to the elicitor-inactive paCOS produced by Chitinase. The priming activity of these elicitor-active paCOS may be a side-effect of their elicitor activity, given that
other elicitors are also known to induce priming.64,65 However, the induction of priming by paCOS with almost no elicitor activity, as described here, appears to be dependent on a different perception mechanism. Indeed, the elicitor-inactive tetramer produced by Chitosanase showed a priming activity similar to that of the corresponding octamer at low micromolar levels, suggesting that the chitin receptor complex in rice may not be involved in chitosan-induced priming. Distinct perception and signal transduction machineries for priming and elicitation are also suggested by other priming-active but elicitor-inactive substances, such as bacterial exopolysacchar
ides17 and the sulfated polysaccharide ulvan.16 This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that a single acetyl group is sufficient and even optimal for priming activity, whereas three of the four acetyl groups of a chitin tetramer are involved in binding by the OsCERK1/CEBiP receptor complex respon
sible for the elicitation of acute resistance responses.53 We observed the highest priming activity for a monoacetylated chitosan tetramer if the GlcNAc unit was located at the nonreducing end (ADDD). Furthermore, a deacetylated GlcN unit at the reducing end also appeared to be necessary for priming activity. Although other partially acetylated tetramers with a deacetylated reducing end (DADD, AADD) also induced priming, neither fully nor partially deacetylated tetramers with an acetyl group at or close to the reducing end (DDDD, DDDA, DDAD, DAAA, ADAA, AADA) were active. This specific structural requirement would argue in favor of recognition by an as yet unknown receptor for small chitosan oligomers that triggers priming rather than eliciting an oxidative burst. The potential existence of a chitosan receptor in rice responsible for priming but not the elicitation of immediate defense responses is of considerable agricultural importance. The elicitation of active resistance is an energy-demanding process that has a yield cost, but this does not appear to be the
case for priming.66 Also, protectively eliciting the production of cytotoxic phytoalexins or triggering programmed cell death during a hypersensitive response would be counterproductive in crop plants. The finding that the small paCOS produced by Chitosanase, but not those produced by Chitinase, have priming activity, is equally relevant for alternative plant protection strategies based on chitosan. The choice of depolymerization method is also important: chemical depolymerization, like Chitinase digestion, would tend to yield oligomers with GlcNAc units at their reducing ends, whereas only Chitosanase digestion would yield oligomers with priming activity. Moreover, smaller oligomers (DP4−6) are preferable because larger oligomers would show unwanted elicitor activity. Our new enzyme-based process is therefore ideal for the production of defined paCOS with priming activity, and could also be developed for the production of paCOS with favorable effects on wound-healing and other therapeutically relevant processes in animal cells. Similar to paCOS, the bioactivities of chitosan polymers have been shown to strongly depend on their DA and, to a
lesser extent, on their DP.61 If a target tissue contains a sequence-specific chitosan hydrolasesuch as human chitotriosidase, plant chitinases, or bacterial and fungal chitinases and chitosanasesthe PA of the chitosan applied will determine the kinetics of its enzymatic hydrolysis as well as the quantity and quality of paCOS produced. Thus, as the bioactivity of paCOS depends on their DP, DA, and PA as shown here, the bioactivities of chitosan polymers can be
expected to also depend on their PA.67 However, this hypothesis has been impossible to test experimentally, as all chitosan polymers that have been availabledue to their
chemical way of production from chitinhave random PA.68 Recently though, it has been shown that enzymatic instead of chemical de-N-acetylation can yield chitosan polymers with
nonrandom PA.69 The availability of these enzymatically produced chitosan polymers with more blockwise or more regular than random PA will allow extension of the chitosan hypothesis on the influence of PA on chitosan bioactivities which we have verified here using enzymatically produced
