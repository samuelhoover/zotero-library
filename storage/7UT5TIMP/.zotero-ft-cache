2 Abstract
3 Zeolites span a large variety of microporous crystal structures, making them use
4 ful materials for catalysis and separations. However, controlling phase competition in
5 their synthesis often requires organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) to selectively
6 crystallize the desired topologies. Whereas computational design of OSDAs can help
7 selecting adequate candidates for zeolite synthesis, machine-generated templates are
8 often complex or expensive. In this work, we use shape and binding metrics to propose
9 templates for over 100 zeolites, and to rationalize dual-OSDA approaches. Starting
10 from OSDAs from the literature, promising templates were selected for zeolites rang
11 ing from clathrasil frameworks to extra large-pore structures. Selectivity maps derived
12 from phase competition metrics show that small- and medium-pore zeolites tend to
1


13 be more shape-selective towards their templates than their large-pore counterparts.
14 Finally, shape and volume descriptors allow identifying OSDAs that may act as syn
15 ergistic pore-fillers for different cavities of zeolites. The application of this theory is
16 demonstrated for the case of KFI zeolite, which may be synthesized using tetraethy
17 lammonium and OSDAs repurposed from high-silica LTA synthesis as dual OSDAs.
18 This work may help discovering new synthesis routes for known zeolites using shape
19 descriptors and repurposed OSDAs.
20 Introduction
21 Zeolites are nanoporous materials with a myriad of applications in industrial catalysis and
22 separations,1–3 and hold promise for sustainable processes.4 The variety of synthetically
23 accessible zeolite polymorphs enables confinement and transport effects to be tuned.5 This
24 topological diversity derives from strong phase competition between metastable zeolite struc
25 tures and it must be be controlled to tailor shape selectivity towards molecular recognition
26 or catalysis.6–8 However, designing synthesis routes towards a target zeolite topology is a
27 labor-intensive task. Zeolites are typically crystallized in hydrothermal conditions, where
28 inorganic precursors and organic templates cooperate to synthesize a topology.9,10 Due to
29 this high-dimensional synthetic parameter space, finding cost-effective and selective routes to
30 synthesize zeolites has been the focus of research works for decades. Within the hydrother
31 mal synthesis of zeolites, organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) play an important role
32 in crystallizing certain topologies.5,11 A combination of electrostatic and dispersion inter
33 actions drive the nucleation of topologies that act as good hosts for that template,10 with
34 the dispersion interaction often determining the outcome topology.11 Although OSDA-free
35 synthesis routes are possible,12–16 they are often limited in terms of selectivity or in the com
36 positions of the final product. On the other hand, OSDA-based routes can yield high-silica
zeolites with a variety of topologies upon the adequate choice of an OSDA.17

38 Computational methods can aid the design of organic templates prior to experimen
2


39 tation.18–25 However, since most computational methods usually predict molecules for one
40 framework at a time, they are unable to predict competing phases that could also be crys
41 tallized by the given molecule. We recently tackled this problem by quantifying phase se
42 lectivity in zeolite synthesis using over half a million simulations, literature mining,25,26 and
43 experimental validation.27 It was demonstrated that selectivity metrics based on binding
44 energies and on shape-matching are important in template-based zeolite synthesis, enabling
45 a computational screening of OSDAs for zeolites. Nevertheless, selectivity is not the only
46 design metric for OSDAs. In order to be practically useful, computer-designed OSDAs must
47 be simultaneously selective and chemically realizable. Although strategies like rule-based
48 molecular enumeration28,29 and computational retrosynthesis20,24 can aid the exploration
49 of synthesizable chemical spaces or automatically suggest synthesis routes for novel OSDAs,
inventing novel molecules in silico may require expensive synthesis routes for production.24,30
50
51 To disentangle these issues of “chemical feasibility” of generated molecules from the com
52 putational templating metrics, we focus on proposing known templates from the literature to
53 obtain zeolites that have not been realized with those OSDAs. In the pharmaceutical field,
54 this strategy of employing known drugs towards new applications is known as drug repurpos
55 ing or repositioning, and is used as a way to reduce the time-to-market of new drugs, since
56 molecules are already validated to be safe and have good physicochemical and toxicological
57 profiles.31 This analogue strategy for OSDA design may offer several advantages, including:
58 (i) bypassing the need to design new OSDAs that are simultaneously stable and soluble in
59 hydrothermal conditions, (ii) avoiding the design of new synthesis routes for the molecules,
60 and (iii) enabling a faster adoption of new zeolite synthesis routes in industrial applications
61 by relying on known templates. In this work, we combine descriptor analysis and data min
62 ing to repurpose known OSDAs for zeolites. Studying from clathrasils to extra large-pore
63 zeolites, we analyze how OSDA volume and shape control phase competition metrics in over
64 one hundred zeolites. In particular, the following contributions are put forward:
65 1. Introducing shape selectivity maps from computational metrics, providing insights on
3


66 how molecular shape influences binding energies in zeolites.
67 2. Repurposing OSDAs for over one hundred known zeolites using shape and binding
68 metrics
69 3. Rationalizing the design of dual-OSDA routes for zeolites using shape metrics, as ex
70 emplified by the LTA and KFI zeolites.
71 This work provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis on shape selectivity for zeo
72 lites. The multiple opportunities shown here may guide future experiments towards zeolite
73 discovery and OSDA repurposing.
74 Methods
75 Binding energy data
76 The simulation data was obtained from Ref. 27, where all simulation details are discussed in
77 depth. Initial zeolite structures were downloaded from the International Zeolite Association
78 (IZA) database32 and pre-optimized using the Sanders-Leslie-Catlow (SLC) parametriza
79 tion.33 The pre-optimization is useful to systematize the structures according to a level of
80 theory that can be extended towards non-experimental zeolites.34 Conformers for OSDAs
were generated using RDKit35 with the MMFF94 force field.36,37
81
82 OSDA-zeolite poses were generated using Voronoi and Monte Carlo docking algorithms
83 in the VOID package.38 Up to 5 different conformers for each OSDA were used as input
84 geometries for VOID. As the occluded molecular conformation can change depending on
85 the outcome zeolite,39,40 the use of different rigid conformers during docking increases the
86 diversity of poses obtained by the algorithm. The Voronoi docking algorithm used the default
87 parameters descibed in Ref. 38, with threshold fitness function with minimum distance of
88 1.25  ̊A, 5 k-means clusters of Voronoi nodes generated with at least 3  ̊A of radius and probe
89 radius of 0.1  ̊A. The Monte Carlo docker algorithm uses 1,000 Monte Carlo steps with a
4


90 normalized temperature of 0.1 for the first 500 steps and 0.0 for the last 500 steps. Although
91 the docking algorithms are run until the loading of OSDAs in zeolites is maximized, the
92 three largest OSDA loadings are simulated downstream using force field calculations. The
93 final pose is the one that minimizes the overall energy of the system among the simulated
94 structures, including guest-guest interactions. This “variational” approach to binding energy
was successful in recalling the outcomes of zeolite synthesis from the literature.27
95
96 Force field calculations were performed using the General Utility Lattice Program (GULP)
97 version 5.1.141,42 through the GULPy package.34 The Dreiding force field43 was used to model
98 dispersion interactions between pure-silica zeolites and OSDAs. Despite the absence of elec
99 trostatic interactions, this approach has demonstrated good agreement when quantifying
100 phase competition from the literature27 and reasonable correlation with density functional
101 theory calculations.34 Binding energies between zeolites and OSDAs were computed using
102 the frozen pose method, where the host-guest interaction energy is obtained after optimizing
the systems at constant volume.34
103
104 The binding energy between a zeolite and an OSDA can be quantified using different
105 normalizations, such as normalization per SiO2 or OSDA. The normalizations provide differ
106 ent interpretations towards OSDA design and can help comparing frameworks with distinct
107 building units.27 When binding energies are compared for a single OSDA across different ze
108 olites, a new metric called “competition energy” is defined. This metric ranks different hosts
109 towards a certain template according to their strength of binding. We adopt the convention
110 that lower competition energies indicate a more preferential binding towards a particular
111 framework using the second-best host as the zero reference for this competition energy.
112 Volume and shape descriptors
113 The volume of the OSDA was calculated using a voxel-based approach. The lowest-energy
114 conformer, as calculated by the MMFF94 force field (see section above), is chosen as the
115 reference geometry. Then, the molecular volume is quantified using a grid of 0.2  ̊A and a
5


margin of 2.0  ̊A for the boxes enclosing the conformer, as implemented in RDKit.35
116
117 In volume-energy visualizations, each OSDA was represented with a marker. If the
118 OSDA was known to synthesize a particular framework, the data point was depicted with a
119 triangle. Otherwise, the data point was depicted with a circle. OSDAs selected as promising
120 candidates for repurposing (see OSDA selection section below) were highlighted with squares
121 whenever they have not been used, to our knowledge, to synthesize the framework under
122 study.
123 OSDA shape descriptors were calculated by reducing the dimensionality of the nuclear
124 coordinates into a 2D space based on a principal component analysis (PCA) of the molecular
125 conformer.27 The procedure for calculating the shape metric is the following (see also Fig.
126 1a):
127 1. The 3D molecular conformer is calculated using simulation methods.
128 2. A 2D plane is fitted to the 3D molecular coordinates in order to maximize the ex
129 plained variance of this distribution of 3D points into the projected 2D space. This
130 is equivalent to performing a PCA-based dimensionality reduction of the 3D atomic
131 positions towards a 2D space.
132 3. Onto the projected plane, the range of projected coordinates are computed.
133 Thus, the shape descriptor enables a 3D geometry to be mapped to two principal axes,
134 with Axis 1 being the larger component. Despite the simplicity of this representation, it has
been shown to correlate with synthetic accessibility of zeolites in OSDA design.27
135
136 In shape-energy visualizations, the shape space of OSDAs — as described by the two
137 principal axes of the molecule — is discretized in hexagonal bins. Each bin is colored using
138 the average binding or competition energy of all OSDAs falling within that region. Brighter
139 colors indicate that OSDAs sharing that shape are, on average, stronger binders to the
140 framework than regions with darker colors. Although changing the parameters of hexagonal
6


141 binning affect the final visualization, features such as energy minima are preserved in this
142 shape selectivity graphs, enabling their qualitative interpretation.

The 3D coordinates of the conformer are projected onto a two-dimensional plane, from which the axes are obtained. b, Construction of a shape selectivity map. Regions of the OSDA shape space are colored according to the strongest binding host towards each template within the systems under analysis.
143 Selectivity map
144 A selectivity map for a family of zeolites is created by first plotting all OSDAs onto the shape
145 space using the two-dimensional metric described above (Fig. 1b). Then, for each OSDA,
146 zeolites are ranked according to their binding energy. The zeolite with the lowest binding
147 energy (most competitive phase) towards each OSDA is highlighted in the shape space of
148 templates with a different color. Finally, a map is then obtained by binning the number of
149 OSDAs in a given region of the shape space, and discretizing these bins according to the most
150 representative zeolite in that region. In some cases where more than one zeolite dominates
151 a given region, both frameworks are shown with overlapping bins. In other cases, outliers in
7


152 the shape space are omitted to improve the clarity of the visualization (see Fig. 1b). Due to
153 the qualitative nature of this plot, selectivity maps should be interpreted as a tool to build
154 intuition on how molecular shape affects zeolite selectivity. Whereas the overall appearance
155 of the plot would change with different binning parameters, the outcome remains helpful
156 not only for repurposing strategies, but also for identifying regions of OSDA biselectivity for
intergrowths. 44
157
158 The selectivity map is performed within families of zeolites, i.e., groups of frameworks
159 sharing the same maximum ring size. Although phase competition is not limited to zeolites
160 with similar ring sizes — that is, a large-pore zeolite such as Beta can be the outcome of a
161 synthesis targeting a small-pore framework — the shape space of similar structures can be
162 best interpreted when families are compared. In addition, the selectivity map is a qualitative
163 assessment of the shape space of the zeolites, and is limited by the representation power of
164 the two-dimensional descriptor. Nevertheless, it is a useful tool to visualize shape selectivity
165 in zeolites, aiding interpretability to the simulation results.
166 OSDA selection
167 OSDAs were downselected according to their volume, shape, synthetic complexity, and bind
168 ing metrics using OSDB.27 In particular, the data available at OSDB was explored using
169 expert knowledge to select OSDAs for the synthesis of each zeolite. Whereas synthetic com
170 plexity metrics can be used for OSDA design,27 the interactive visualizations further aid
171 expert-based selection of molecules with higher potential and/or lower cost.
172 In addition to expert-based synthetic complexity, the following heuristic rules for downs
173 election were imposed to restrict the search space:
174 • Positively charged OSDAs were preferred over neutral ones, motivated by the synthesis
175 of aluminosilicate zeolite structures over zeotypes.
176 • Phosphonium-based OSDAs were avoided due to restrictions related to the industrial
8


177 application of such templates.
178 • Templates with hydroxide groups were avoided due to their reduced hydrothermal
179 stability.
180 Despite these requirements, no OSDAs were removed from the volume-energy plots for
181 compatibility with the public interface implemented in OSDB.
182 OSDA selection was performed by first identifying preferential volumes of OSDAs to
183 wards a particular zeolite by exploring the regions near energy minima in volume-energy
184 plots. Whenever zeolites have more than one energy minimum, OSDAs in all minima were
185 investigated. Although molecules with volumes smaller than 175  ̊A can seemingly lead to
186 strong binding energies, particularly in large- and extra large-pore zeolites, they often re
187 quire higher loadings to achieve such low energies. Smaller sizes and higher loadings may
188 increase the competition energy of the templates, thus making them less selective for larger
189 structures.27 Therefore, promising OSDAs were identified by simultaneously maximizing the
190 binding strength and volume within the constraints described above.
191 After OSDAs with volumes of interest were downselected, the molecules were compared
192 according to their shapes. If the shape space of the zeolite exhibits regions of higher selec
193 tivity, i.e., shapes that lead to lower average energies, OSDAs exhibiting shapes leading to
194 these energy minima were preferred over templates with distinct shapes. This shape-driven
195 downselection of molecules has demonstrated to increase the synthetic accessibility of zeo
196 lites.27 On the other hand, if the zeolite framework does not exhibit local minima in the
197 energy-shape landscape, molecules with diverse shapes are proposed.

198 Results and Discussion
199 Six-membered rings zeolites
200 Zero-dimensional zeolites are examples of systems where, at a constant gel composition, the
201 choice of the OSDA often determines the outcome of the synthesis.11 Six-membered frame
202 works are considered inaccessible for the diffusion of molecules and thus are rarely sought
203 to be synthesized with OSDAs. However, their constituent building units are sometimes
204 observed in other zeolites. Thus, analyzing structure-directing effects in zero-dimensional
205 zeolites is essential not only to control phase competition effects, but also to understand how
206 to direct the formation of particular building units shared between these and other zeolites.
207 Figures S1-S12 show examples of OSDAs that are known to lead to the synthesis of zero
208 dimensional zeolite structures. In many cases, the templates are small, such as the ones for
209 SOD zeolite (Fig. S9). The sod building unit is selectively synthesized using tetramethylam
210 monium or similar small molecules. Although synthesizing the SOD framework is typically
211 undesirable, understanding the shape selectivity of its components can guide the synthe
212 sis of zeolites with more interesting applications such as LTA. In other cases, zeolites with
213 larger volumes such as NON (Fig. S6) or SGT (Fig. S8) may compete with the synthesis
214 of small-pore frameworks. In particular, spiro-type OSDAs show similar binding patterns
215 between NON and CHA zeolites, and synthesis routes involving these OSDAs may result
216 in NON or LOS (Fig. S4) frameworks rather than the more commercially interesting CHA
217 framework.27 Finally, longer or wider OSDAs may crystallize zero-dimensional zeolites with
218 large cavities such as LIO (Fig. S3), MSO (Fig. S5), TOL (Fig. S11), or UOZ (Fig. S12).
219 As directing the crystallization of substructures in these frameworks is often undesirable,
220 the phase competition analysis allows avoiding templates which may lead to these zeolites
221 rather than targeted ones.
10


222 Small-pore zeolites
223 Small-pore zeolites are characterized by cavities with eight-membered rings. The confine
224 ment effects due to the cavity sizes and shapes are responsible for altering catalyst stability
and selectivity for many chemical processes, including selective catalytic reduction of NOx
225
226 or methanol-to-olefin reactions.45,46 Modulating the shapes of OSDAs while keeping the re
227 action conditions constant may lead to the crystallization of different small-pore zeolites
228 or intergrowths.27 In some cases, however, frameworks such as ITE and RTH exhibit stark
229 structural similarities,44 which may hinder the control of phase competition.
230 Figure 2 shows a selectivity map of OSDA shapes in small-pore zeolites. The selectivity
231 map was created by selecting the best small-pore framework towards each of the OSDAs in
232 the database, and outlining the regions of the shape space that favor each framework. The
233 shape and binding energy metrics recover intuitive building schemes from the zeolites. For
234 example, LEV zeolite has the smallest cavity, and its OSDA selectivity region is found in
235 the lower left of the shape space. On the other hand, SFW and SWY have long cages, but
236 their ABC-6 stacking pattern limits their diameters, which leads to a long axis 1 in Fig.
237 2, but an axis 2 comparable to those of AEI or RTH zeolites. In addition, the CHA/AEI
238 regions intersect in terms of selectivity, as expected by the crystallization of these intergrown
239 structures with bi-selective OSDAs. In the central region of Fig. 2, ERI zeolite has a slightly
240 longer cage than CHA, but still smaller than AFX. LTA zeolite is an exception to these
241 zeolites, as its large lta cage requires molecules that can effectively occupy its volume in
242 both axes.
243 As an example of how novel molecules can be proposed towards the synthesis of zeolites
244 with few examples of templates in the literature, Fig. 3 shows OSDAs predicted to be
245 favorable towards SWY zeolite. According to the selectivity map of Fig. 2, OSDAs favorable
246 towards SWY should have a shape characterized by an axis 1 between 14-16  ̊A and an axis 2
247 of about 5  ̊A. Indeed, the two OSDAs known to synthesize SWY, shown in Fig. 3a (OSDAs
248 1, 2), fall within this region of the shape space. Two repurposed OSDAs (OSDAs 3 and 4

249 in Fig. 3a) have similar shapes (Fig. 3c), with cyclohexyl groups that could lower the cost
250 of the OSDA compared to more expensive radicals such as DABCO or quinuclidine. Both
251 OSDAs are also close to the ideal volume of ∼ 350  ̊A3 of the large cavity characteristic to
252 SWY (Fig. 3b). However, the binding energy and volume metrics suggest the possibility of
253 synthesizing this zeolite with smaller OSDAs, which could assemble in pairs to fill the cavity,
254 similarly to what is carried out in the SFW zeolite.47 OSDA 5 in Fig. 3a has approximately
255 half of the volume of the cavity, and is also evidenced by a minimum of binding energy
256 in the binding-volume plots (Fig. 3b). Additionally, OSDA 5 has an axis 2 comparable to
257 those from known OSDAs, indicating its adequate diameter towards the characteristic cavity
258 of SFW, and approximately half of their length (Fig. 3c). These results suggest that the
259 proposed OSDA is an interesting candidate to attempt the synthesis of SWY.
260 Figures S13-39 show other examples of OSDAs from the literature predicted to be fa
261 vorable towards small-pore zeolites. In addition to well-known frameworks, the figures show
262 opportunities to attempt the crystallization of known small-pore zeolites, but with broader
263 compositions, including the AVL (Fig. S17) or SAV (Fig. S36) frameworks. The figures also
264 highlight the shape matching landscape of: small-cage frameworks such as ITE (Fig. S25)
265 or RTH (Fig. S33); 1D channel zeolites such as AWW (Fig. S18), IRN (Fig. S24), or SAS
266 (Fig. S34); or structures with larger cavities such as AFX (Fig. S15), EEI (Fig. S20), or

268 Medium-pore zeolites
269 Medium-pore zeolites are widely used in petrochemical and fine-chemical applications. Zeo
270 lite ZSM-5 (MFI), for example, is a versatile material used in a variety of catalytic applica
271 tions such as oil refining or xylene isomerization.48–50 As another example, Theta-1 (TON)
272 is used in paraffin isomerizations.51 While ten-membered channels enable longer templates
273 to be used in the synthesis of medium-pore zeolites, matching medium pores with molecular
274 sizes/shapes is paramount to achieve high selectivity in the synthesis of these materials. Fur
275 thermore, although templates for the synthesis of some of these materials are well-known,
276 synthesizing uncommon medium-pore frameworks with known templates can enable novel
277 uses in catalytic applications.
278 Figure 4 shows the shape selectivity of OSDAs towards selected frameworks, created
279 using the methodology described in the previous section. Differently from small-pore zeolites,
280 however, the pores of medium-pore zeolites enable templates of different sizes to be occluded
281 within the structure, thus exhibiting lower shape selectivity. Nevertheless, frameworks such
282 as STI, CSV, or MWW (Fig. 4a) exhibit cavities that favor certain templates over others. In
283 cases such as SFF or EUO (Fig. 4a), the undulated pores or side pockets, respectively, may
284 be responsible for the shape selectivity of some zeolites within templated synthesis. Finally,
285 zeolites with intersecting pores such as SFG may be favored by larger molecules, which better
286 occupy the large space in the pore intersection and give it higher shape selectivity compared
287 to other medium-pore frameworks. Similarly to Fig. 2b, combining the plots from Fig. 4a
288 leads to the selectivity maps for some medium-pore zeolites in Fig. 4b. This map allows
289 interpreting the results of the binding metrics using the molecular shape descriptor. For
290 instance, STI can be synthesized either with small molecules such as tetraethylammonium
291 or with diquaternary molecules twice as long as these templates, indicating its appearance
292 both at values of axis 1 close to 6 and 12 A ̊. Similarly, selectivity towards MWW and SFG
14


293 increases as the size of the molecule also increases. The wide, yet short cavities of CSV favor
294 templates with larger values of axis 2, while the side pockets of EUO favor molecules with
295 more elongated shapes.
Figure 4: a, Selectivity map of OSDAs towards medium-pore zeolites. b, OSDAs known and proposed for the synthesis of CSV. These molecules exhibit favorable c, volume, and d, shape towards this framework.
296 Figures S40-S65 show examples of OSDAs from the literature whose volumes and shapes
297 approach ideal values for medium-pore zeolites, as derived from simulation results. In addi
298 tion to the structures shown in Fig. 4b, other “cage-like” zeolite structures that display
299 clear shape selectivity towards OSDAs, as evidenced by volumes and shapes that opti
300 mize the binding energy, include EWS (Fig. S45) or IFW (Fig. S47). One-dimensional,
15


301 medium-pore zeolites such as MTT (Fig. S55) or STF (Fig. S60) also exhibit binding
302 curves with shape selectivity due to the commensurability of the OSDAs with respect to
303 the unit cell44 or the undulation of the pore. To exemplify how OSDAs can be repurposed
304 for the synthesis of zeolites recently discovered, thus with few known synthesis routes, we
305 selected the example of CSV zeolite. This framework has been discovered with the use of a
306 diquarternary imidazolium-based OSDA, and can also be synthesized using the 2-ethyl-1,3
307 dimethylimidazolium (Fig. 4c).52 The selectivity of OSDAs for this zeolite is demonstrated
308 by the minimum of binding energy for molecules with about 140  ̊A3 of volume, when two
309 OSDAs occupy the main CSV cage, and around 280  ̊A3, when only one OSDA can occupy
310 this same cavity. Figure 4c shows three repurposed OSDAs with volumes close to the ideal
311 280  ̊A3 per cavity (Fig. 4d). In particular, the sparteinium-based molecules can be prepared
312 with one or two quaternary nitrogens, which can be an advantage if two positive charges per
313 cage are necessary to stabilize the CSV framework. In addition, these molecules lie around a
314 minimum of binding energy in the shape space, as evidenced by the appearance of a brighter
315 area in Fig. 4e. Therefore, the data-driven analysis proposes OSDAs 2-4 from Fig. 4c as
316 novel candidates for the synthesis of CSV zeolites.
317 Large-pore zeolites
318 Large-pore zeolites make the most of the synthetic zeolite market, and are dominated mostly
319 by frameworks such as FAU, Beta or MOR. The large cavities and pores enable these materi
320 als to be used not only for cracking or catalytic upgrading of larger hydrocarbons, but also to
321 process biomass-based chemicals.49 One of the main challenges in the synthesis of large-pore
322 zeolites is obtaining high Si/Al ratios required in several catalytic processes. While OSDAs
323 can help achieving high quality zeolites, designing templates that selectively direct the crys
324 tallization of large-pore zeolites can be challenging. Figures 5a,b show the shape selectivity
325 diagram for a few zeolites. Contrary to small- and medium-pore zeolites, large-pore frame
326 works do not exhibit the same distinct shape selectivity. Although the confinement effects
16


327 of each framework are system-specific, binding energies may vary substantially according to
328 the template, and may not always be ascribed to its shape. As a result, domains of shape
329 selectivity are not as clearly observed as in Figs. 2 or 4.
Figure 5: a, Selectivity map of OSDAs colored according to the best host among large-pore zeolites. Only a subset of large-pore zeolites is shown for clarity. b, OSDAs known and proposed for the synthesis of CON. These molecules exhibit c, favorable volume towards this framework. As with other large-pore zeolites, the d shape selectivity of CON is not as distinguishable as that from small- or medium-pore zeolites.
330 Despite the absence of well-defined domains where OSDAs are selective towards mostly
331 one large-pore framework, the design of templates based on shape and volume can still be
332 performed for these zeolites. Figure 5c shows an example of OSDAs repurposed for the CIT
333 1 (CON) zeolite. This framework contains 12-ring channels intersecting 10-ring channels at
334 non-perpendicular angles. Due to this unique structure, the crystallization of this framework
335 has been realized mostly with complex OSDAs, some of which may form molecular aggregates
336 to fill the intersections accordingly. Nevertheless, Fig. 5d shows that other OSDAs may be
337 effective towards the synthesis of this framework. In particular, the trisquaternary OSDA
17


338 1 in Fig. 5c fits well into the angled pore intersection due to its flexibility and distinct
339 shape. OSDA 2 has volume and binding energy similar to OSDA 1, yet exhibit no rotatable
340 bonds. Instead of occupying both channels in the intersection, OSDA 2 achieves high binding
341 strength by occupying the 10-ring channel. Similarly, OSDA 3 fills this channel with a larger
342 loading due to its smaller volume yet shape comparable to OSDA 2 (Fig. 5e), decreasing
343 the binding energy even more. This template is similar to the OSDA proposed by Okubo
344 et al. when cost-aware molecular generation algorithms are employed,24 but has a higher
345 volume and thus may have a better pore-filling ability. Nevertheless, despite the local binding
346 energy minimum around OSDA volumes of 200 A ̊3 for CON zeolite, it is unclear whether
347 the framework can be synthesized using smaller molecules such as OSDA 3.
348 Figures S66-S99 showcase selected OSDAs with favorable volumes and shapes for the
349 synthesis of large-pore zeolites. Frameworks of interest which could be synthesized using
350 repurposed OSDAs include BEA (Fig. S70), BEC (Fig. S71), BOG (Fig. S72), GME (Fig.
351 S78), ISV (Fig. S79), or LTL (Fig. S84). Given the nature of the large pores and cavities, all
352 these zeolites could require rather large OSDAs to achieve high silicon to aluminum ratios.
353 Frameworks with cavity-like substructures such as IWS (Fig. S82), MEI (Fig. S86), or MOZ
354 (Fig. S88) generally display higher shape selectivity, as supported by the binding patterns
355 emerging from volumes and shapes of OSDAs docked in the frameworks. Structures for which
356 few OSDAs are known, such as SSF (Fig. S70), could find new practical applications if lower
357 cost synthesis routes were enabled by new templates. Furthermore, structures synthesized
358 only as zeotypes such as SFO (Fig. S95) may be realized with selective OSDAs that could
359 enable their synthesis as aluminosilicates. In summary, although large-pore zeolites are not
360 as shape-selective as their small- or medium-pore counterparts, OSDAs may still be proposed
361 for them using binding energies, volume and shape as interpretable design metrics.
18


362 Extra large-pore zeolites
363 Beyond large-pore zeolites, structures containing rings of size larger than 12 framework
364 sites are called extra large-pore zeolites. Their well-defined crystallinity and active site
365 distributions contrasts with mesoporous materials, making extra large-pore zeolites potential
366 candidates for shape-selective catalysis.53,54 However, synthesizing extra large-pore zeolites
367 exhibiting thermal stability, adequate acidity, and low cost is challenging.55,56 Often, extra
368 large-pore frameworks are synthesized as zeotypes or germanosilicates, or require expensive
OSDAs to be produced.54
369
370 Given the aperture sizes in these structures and the lead from large-pore zeolites, shape
371 selectivity in these frameworks may not be achieved in the same way as small- or medium
372 pore zeolites. Rather, the tendency to form molecular aggregates to occupy the void space
373 in zeolites may not be fully predicted by simulations.27 Nevertheless, a few selected zeolites
374 exhibit binding energy minima in volume plots, suggesting that certain molecular volumes
375 and shapes can increase the binding strength by maximizing the pore-filling effects through
376 control of loading. Figures S100-S109 show a few examples of binding energy plots and
377 OSDAs selected for extra large-pore frameworks. Zeolites such as OSO (Fig. S105) exhibit
378 distinct shape selectivity, with a narrow range of OSDA volumes leading to low binding
379 energies, although it may require beryllium to be synthesized. Structures such as CFI (Fig.
380 S101), SFH (Fig. S106), and SFN (Fig. S107) show a minimum in energy for a given
381 volume, although this may be related to the short lengths of the unit cell parameter in the
382 pore direction. Frameworks such as IRR (Fig. S103), ITT (Fig. S104), or VFI (Fig. S109)
383 have broad pores and cavities, enabling higher loadings of small molecules that minimize the
384 overall binding energy per SiO2, although the structure-directing role of heteroatoms may
385 play a more important role in these frameworks than the OSDA alone.54 In zeolites such as
386 VFI, large templates such as OSDA 2 in Fig. S109 can have low phase competition towards
387 the extra-large pore zeolite despite not forming molecular aggregates. This stems from the
388 impossibility of docking larger templates into zeolites with smaller cavities or pores, thus
19


389 reducing phase competition effects in OSDA-based synthesis. Finally, frameworks such as
390 CTH (Fig. S102) and UTL (Fig. S108) show two distinct energy minima, corresponding
391 to the different sizes of intersecting two-dimensional pores. Although the synthesis of extra
392 large-pore zeolites may depend on factors beyond OSDAs, the design principles from volume
393 matching may help choosing adequate pore-fillers to realize these frameworks, whose diversity
394 is still limited in the field.
395 Dual-OSDA design
396 In addition to designing single OSDAs to one framework as before, the shape-based OSDA
397 descriptors can aid the selection of templates for dual-OSDA approaches. While in several
398 cases the use of multiple templates to synthesize a particular zeolite is undesirable due to
399 added synthesis costs, as in the case of intergrowth structures,27,44 in many other examples
400 the approach can enable synthesizing structures with previously unattainable compositions.
401 One of the most common cases in the literature is the synthesis of high-silica LTA framework
402 with two OSDAs.57–59 In this framework, one of the OSDAs directs the formation of the sod
403 cage, whereas the other crystallizes the lta cavity. In general, tetramethylammonium is used
404 to crystallize the former, and another template is used to crystallize the latter. Although the
dual-OSDA approach does not always lead to product frameworks matching this intuition,60
405
406 the analogy may be combined with the shape descriptors to rationalize the selection of other
407 synthesis routes.
408 One zeolite that could be of commercial interest in its high-silica form is the KFI frame
409 work. The synthetic form of this material is usually synthesized with methylated diquat
410 ernized DABCO or the 18-crown-6-ether, but only in low Si/Al ratios.46 This has hindered
411 a broader application of KFI for catalysis, and, to our knowledge, no synthesis route for
412 KFI with high Si/Al ratio has yet been reported. To propose a route for crystallization of
413 KFI zeolite with a dual-OSDA approach, we analyzed the binding energies of OSDAs from
414 the literature towards this material. Figure 6 shows how the use of two distinct OSDAs for
20


415 the synthesis of KFI can be derived from the binding and shape metrics. In particular, we
416 propose that in addition to selecting an OSDA for crystallizing the lta cage, tetraethylam
417 monium may help directing the formation of the KFI zeolite. This is evidenced by the two
418 binding energy minima in Fig. 6b, and by the two low-competition regions in the shape
419 space of Fig. 6c. Similar to the dual OSDA approach of LTA (Fig. S110c), tetraethylam
420 monium is a low-cost template that is selective towards the pau cavity present in KFI (Fig.
421 S110a,b). This is further supported by the binding energy curve of MER zeolite, which is
422 formed mostly by the pau building unit and has tetraethylammonium as one of its ideal
423 molecules in terms of volume and shape (Fig. S110d). Experimental results have also shown
424 that tetraethylammonium OSDAs are located in these pau cavities in the synthesis of KFI
425 with multi-inorganic cations, although only with low Si/Al ratios.61 Although quantifying
426 phase competition within dual-OSDA scenarios with a single figure of metric for OSDA
427 combinations has not been demonstrated yet, decomposing the OSDA design into steps, as
428 allowed by the shape and volume metrics, may help achieving zeolites with a diversity of
429 cavities and functions.

430 Discussion
431 This work shows how existing OSDAs may be applied to the synthesis of diverse zeolites
432 not previously associated with them, based on binding, volume, and shape arguments. This
433 “repurposing” strategy has been empirically used in the field for decades, as best exemplified
434 by templates such as tetraethylammonium. This OSDA is known to yield a variety of
435 frameworks in numerous conditions, making these syntheses attractive due to smaller costs
436 of the template.62 Another example of this computational repurposing strategy is the use of
437 6-azaspiro[5.6]dodecan-6-ium in the synthesis of CHA. Although the low selectivity of this
438 template had been taken as a drawback in the past,63 its ability to direct the formation of
439 more than one framework was used as a feature to direct the synthesis of SSZ-13 while also
controlling its aluminum distribution.27
440
441 The strategy in this work is backed by retrospective analysis of literature data, and has
442 supported experimental validation in recent works.27 Nevertheless, improving some of the
443 approximations may lead to even more accurate and predictive models. For instance, it
444 is still unclear whether a small set of simple molecular descriptors can predict all phases
445 arising from zeolite synthesis. “True negative” data points in zeolite synthesis are rarely
446 established due to the dimensionality of synthesis conditions beyond organic templates. For
447 example, combinations of inorganic structure-directing agents have a major influence in the
448 crystallized zeolites,64 and may enable the control of new topologies or compositions.65 Sim
449 ilarly, residual inorganic cations from the OSDA synthesis can also drive the formation of
450 competing phases.66 Differences in the intrinsic stability of zeolite frameworks can also play
451 a role during nucleation and growth of zeolites, potentially influencing the outcome of the
452 synthesis. Future predictions may benefit from the simulation of phase selectivity during
453 these kinetic processes,67,68 enabling a better understanding of the crystallization mecha
454 nism beyond host-guest interactions. Finally, heteroatom distributions and concentration
455 can also change the free energy of frameworks69,70 and affect the final phase selectivity of
456 templates.71 Therefore, the limits of repurposing approaches have still to be determined both
22


457 from experimental and theoretical investigations.
458 From the computational side, the lack of electrostatics, heteroatoms, or inorganic structure
459 directing agents in the methods from this work only enable a first selection of OSDAs accord
460 ing to their templating effects from shape-matching. Once good templates are selected, more
461 expensive calculations can be performed to understand heteroatom distributions, kinetics of
462 crystallization, or framework stability. Because this work relies on classical force fields as a
463 first layer of simulation, limitations in the force field parametrization may result in errors,
464 such as poor estimates of guest-guest interactions or zeolite formation enthalpies.34 These
465 may bias the predicted OSDA loadings and host stabilization energies. Although correlations
466 between zeolite synthetic accessibility and OSDA descriptors have been derived using the
467 approximations shown in this work,27 new computational methods are required to accelerate
468 predictions of electrostatic effects in templated zeolite synthesis at scale.
469 Even with qualitative design rules, however, computational modeling can provide flexi
470 bility in the selection of templates for zeolite synthesis. The dual-OSDA rationalization from
471 shape and volume descriptors show how the geometric metrics enable OSDA design even in
472 the absence of simulations. Similarly, the selectivity maps can show how phase competition
473 can be controlled by designing templates with different shapes, which is also useful for the
474 synthesis of intergrown frameworks,44 or for rationalizing low shape selectivity in synthesis
475 of large- and extra-large pore zeolites. By abstracting away the complexity of molecular
476 conformation, aggregation, and docking in zeolite synthesis, it is possible to bypass compu
477 tational simulations when designing templates without sacrificing the intuition behind each
478 descriptor.
479 Conclusion
480 In summary, we analyzed a dataset of binding energies to repurpose known OSDAs for the
481 synthesis of over one hundred zeolites. The data-driven analysis shows that a combination
23


482 of binding metrics and geometric descriptors of templates may help the selection of OSDAs
483 that are good binders towards the structures of interest. The data also shows that selectivity
484 maps can be constructed for selected small- and medium-pore zeolites, where frameworks
485 exhibit higher shape selectivity in the templated synthesis. On the other hand, large-pore
486 frameworks seem to have lower shape selectivity due to larger openings. Furthermore, the
487 binding-volume plots may help the selection of OSDAs for zeolites in a dual-template ap
488 proach. Using the case of LTA zeolite as a reference, we propose the use of tetraethylam
489 monium for the synthesis of KFI, aiding the crystallization of its pau cages. This work
490 provides examples of alternative OSDAs for several zeolites in the literature, and may be
491 a comprehensive reference for future experimental attempts in the synthesis of frameworks
492 with different compositions or synthesis routes.
