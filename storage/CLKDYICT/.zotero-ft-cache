Abstract
The multiscale design of soft materials requires an ensemble of computational techniques spanning quantum-chemistry to molecular dynamics to continuum modeling. The recent emergence of machine-learning (ML) and modern optimization algorithms has accelerated material property prediction, as well as stimulated the development of hybrid ML/molecular modeling methodologies capable of providing physical insights unobtainable from purely physics-based modeling and intuition. Such hybrid techniques also have important ramifications for the ML-enhanced interpretation of results from simulations and experiments alike. Leveraging ML techniques for the design of chemical or morphological structures based on a target property or functionality represents an exciting goal for the general area of soft materials, including polymers, liquid crystals, colloids, or biomolecules, to name a few representative classes of systems. Here, we provide a perspective on recent work using ML techniques of relevance for the multiscale design of soft materials and outline potential future directions of interest to the soft materials community.

Introduction
A primary challenge for soft materials design is the strong coupling of disparate length and timescales that mediates materials behavior; molecular degradation is influenced by macroscopic environment, electronic and ionic transport are controlled by mesoscale morphology, and biological
functionality is inherently hierarchical. This confluence of length and timescales requires the integration of an array of theoretical, computational, and data-centric techniques to fully characterize material performance. Design efforts could be greatly enhanced not only by predictive models that capture multiscale structure-function relationships in existing materials but also by generative design techniques that identify new candidate soft matter chemistries and morphologies for target applications.
In the past decade, machine-learning (ML) approaches to molecular modeling have transformed the landscape of materials research and engineering. The success of ML applied to “hard” materials motivates the question of why ML has not similarly affected soft materials research. As noted by Ferguson [1], this is principally attributable to (i) the qualitative diversity of soft matter systems and the variety of modeling techniques (quantum-chemistry to finite element methods) required, (ii) the importance of entropic effects and competing kinetic/thermodynamic states for a given material, and (iii) emergent many-body effects that are ubiquitous in soft materials. Soft materials research is further complicated by a lack of obvious order parameters, as they are often amorphous or disordered, and their behavior is often governed by a competition between multiple weak interactions, thereby rendering any design endeavor particularly susceptible to small perturbations. Thus, by comparison to many inorganic systems or hard materials for which the structure is known or well defined, relevant structural motifs for soft materials, such as polymers and colloids, are often unknown and may depend on processing conditions/history. Consequently, no single ML approach suits the entire soft matter community simultaneously, and solutions must be tailored to specific research needs. This fact has naturally slowed the adoption of ML in soft matter, though there are no fundamental physical attributes impeding its integration.
In this article, we discuss the emergence of ML algorithms of interest for soft materials modeling. In particular, we focus on developments related to (i) molecular property prediction and chemical discovery and (ii) multiscale simulation and analysis. As the focus of this article is on the application of ML for the molecular modeling of soft materials, we do not address promising work relevant to the soft matter community in the areas of closed-loop discovery, experimental automation and

optimization, or reaction prediction, nor do we extensively review technical details of the various ML algorithms employed. Finally, due to space limitations, this perspective cannot comprehensively review all impactful work in the field. Instead, included or highlighted works are intended to showcase illustrative advances relevant to soft materials design, based on our own biases. Readers are thus encouraged to further explore the articles, the references therein and beyond to gain a broader and complete perspective.
Molecular property prediction and chemical discovery in soft materials Molecular property prediction
An overarching goal for modeling soft materials concerns the prediction of physical observables derived solely from a molecule’s chemical structure. In this regard, efforts have traditionally been split between two approaches: (i) first-principles modeling and (ii) the statistical learning of physicochemical properties via mathematical representations of molecular structures, with no reliance on fundamental physical equations. While both paradigms have been widely adopted by the soft material community, they experience known limitations pertaining to accuracy and/or computational cost. Recent breakthroughs in featurization approaches and ML algorithms promise to enable the statistical learning of first-principles-derived physical properties at a fraction of the conventional computational costs.
Effective representation of molecules as inputs to ML algorithms is a prerequisite to the success of molecular property predictions. While specifying Cartesian coordinates yields a unique solution of the Schr  ̈odinger equation, such coordinates are inadequate as inputs for ML algorithms because they lack appropriate invariances to translation, rotation, and permutation of like atoms. Consequently, features based on radial symmetry functions, Coulomb matrices, or other vector-based schemes are often used to encode structural and chemical properties [2–4]. While some descriptors use sorting techniques to satisfy input requirements, other featurization approaches explicitly incorporate critical invariances and symmetries, such as the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) [5] for learning multipole moments and polarizabilities [6]. For soft matter applications, work combining SOAP (for featurization) and Gaussian Process Regression (as the ML algorithm) to estimate relative energies of organic crystals as well as intermolecular electronic couplings relevant to charge transport [7] is particularly intriguing. It will be interesting to see if SOAP can be extended to broadly characterize the properties of soft materials, given the ubiquity of disorder and heterogeneity in such systems. Given the proliferation of available molecular feature representations, the work of Imbalzano et al. guiding the selection of optimal
feature representations based on the intrinsic structure of the underlying data is highly relevant for soft materials researchers looking to incorporate ML into their modeling efforts [3]. Moreover, the importance of selecting effective featurization approaches is underscored by the work of Pronobis, which showed how combining a novel 2-body featurization approach with a linear ML algorithm yielded comparable performance to other advanced non-linear ML algorithms [8].
The use of molecular graphs to represent chemical structures has also enabled many recent, high-performing ML methods [9,10]. The MoleculeNet database of Wu and coworkers highlights the predictive performance of graph-based featurizations and their associated artificial neural network (ANN) ML algorithms on tasks relevant to soft materials [11]. In hundreds of prediction tasks across multiple length and time scale phenomena, graphbased representations demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, which the authors attributed to the ability of graph-based ML algorithms to extract molecular information via convolutions over subgraphs of the molecular environment. Further generalizing this graph-based paradigm is the work by Schutt et al. developing the deep tensor neural network (DTNN) approach [12]. This technique utilizes convolutions over molecular environments defined by distance matrices and nuclear charges to predict a variety of molecular properties and has recently been adapted to handle periodic boundary conditions [13]. Interestingly, recent work by Gilmer et al. illustrates how a spectrum of graph-convolutional networks may be cast into a single common framework (Message Passing Neural Networks) with broad applicability [14].
To conclude this section, we highlight two works underscoring the role of data in the application of ML to the modeling of soft materials. First is the work of Faber, which illustrates that many ML methods have surpassed actual ab-initio methods (relative to the exact result) in terms of predictive accuracy [15]. This suggests that ML models could further improve predictive accuracy if large quantities of high quality data (e.g. explicitly electron correlated or experimental) were available. With this in mind, the aforementioned MoleculeNet framework warrants further emphasis [11]. For MoleculeNet, researchers identified 800 different prediction tasks spanning quantum-mechanical physical properties to macroscopic physiological effects, with efforts to extend the scope of this database in the future. Clearly, standardized databases and algorithm implementations such as MoleculeNet will be key to future advancement of ML in soft materials modeling.
Generative molecular and morphological design
Coinciding with developments in molecular property prediction have been advancements applying ML algorithms for materials design. Since intuition-based

design is notoriously difficult given the complexities underlying soft materials, generative design methods for both molecular and morphological structure discovery are of tremendous interest to the soft matter community.
Early work on the design problem for soft materials applied high-throughput virtual screening to identify promising organic light-emitting diode molecules, which were subsequently synthesized, tested, and confirmed as high-performance materials [16]. More recently, variational autoencoders (VAE) have been used to convert discrete molecular representations into a continuous latent space upon which gradient optimization
algorithms can be applied [17], and promise to be a powerful avenue for the future design of soft materials (see Figure 1). Other design strategies include generative adversarial networks (GAN) [18] and reinforcement learning techniques [19], which have been used to guide the structural evolution of organic compounds towards particular soft material applications. Future advances in generative design will require solving the graph isomorphism and generation problem, such that emerging graph-based feature representations may be effectively combined with generative algorithms. A review by Sanchez-Lengeling and Aspuru-Guzik discussing the current state of generative materials design algorithms is strongly suggested for this topic [20].
For soft matter applications, designing condensed-phase and multi-molecular properties (self-assembly, for example) is a challenging but necessary task. Early work in this direction includes that by Mannodi-Kanakkithodi et al., which combines ML predictions of condensed phase dielectric constants with genetic algorithms to design new polymeric repeat units [21]. Work by multiple groups have instantiated databases of computed and experimental polymer properties that should greatly facilitate future design of polymeric materials [22–25]. In another example, Long and Ferguson utilized diffusion maps (an unsupervised ML approach) along with enhanced sampling tools to obtain low-dimensional free-energy landscape representations for patchy particle self-assembly [26]. Then, they leveraged covariance matrix adaptation-evolution strategy (CMA-ES) to optimize properties of patchy colloidal particles, such that they would assemble into targeted structural motifs. These examples illustrate the potential of using ML techniques for designing soft materials.

of soft matter are facilitated by fitting analytical functions that approximate the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES); the fitting is based, at least in part, on electronic-structure calculations. The accuracy and transferability of this approach is restricted by particular functional forms and can be limiting or constraining. Meanwhile, the prospects of utilizing purely firstprinciples simulations of soft materials is glum, given the lengthscales and timescales required for examining macromolecular properties and the computational expense of evaluating the electronic structure on-the-fly. Recent advances that leverage ML in force-field development may be key for simulating soft matter with greater accuracy and efficiency.
ML-derived force fields, or machine-learning potentials (MLPs), can provide accuracy commensurate with the electronic structure method used to generate training data at significantly reduced cost [27,28]. Already, MLPs have been effectively used to study a number of systems of varying complexity, ranging from small-to-intermediately sized molecules and molecular clusters to electrolyte solutions and interfaces [28–32]. An attractive feature of MLPs is that they sidestep limitations imposed by choosing particular analytical functions and further enable a description of effects — reactivity, polarizability, many-body interactions — that are either neglected or complexly described in traditional force fields. Moreover, when trained directly to ab initio data, they can be effectively combined with path-integral methods to include nuclear quantum effects in MD simulations [30,32,33]. However, certain challenges remain for the proliferation of MLPs to studies of soft matter.
One issue relates to efficiently treating systems with rich chemical complexity. Just as in chemical discovery, MLPs require definition of appropriate input features or descriptors for the atomic environment; this choice impacts both simulation efficiency and accuracy [3,27]. Commonly used atom-centered symmetry functions scale poorly with increasing number of distinct elements, since separate sets of radial functions are required for every pair and triplet of elements. Recently, Gastegger et al. [34] utilized element-dependent weighting functions in their symmetry functions to implicitly account for local chemistry, thereby limiting the number of required basis functions and enhancing simulation efficiency without shortchanging accuracy.
Relatedly, descriptors in MLPs tend to be intrinsically local and limited to approximate short-range interaction energies. While perhaps reasonable for small molecules or clusters, this is likely problematic in condensed-phase and interfacial simulations with macromolecules. One appealing approach is to augment short-range MLPs with long-range physics, as demonstrated by Yao et al. in their hybrid TensorMol-0.1 approach, which couples a
short-range ANN potential with long-range electrostatic
and van der Waals physics [35]. Similarly, Bereau and coworkers have prescribed a strategy that uses ML to parameterize a handful of transferable, global parameters in a set of physics-based potentials representing noncovalent interactions [36].
These latter two works [35,36] are also in pursuit of MLPs that are transferable across chemical composition. In part, such efforts are motivated by another key challenge, which is related to dataset construction. Namely, effective parameterization of a high-quality MLP depends intimately on both the amount of training data produced as well as the chemical and configurational biases of that data; recent works have approached these issues in a variety of ways. Smith et al. have utilized an active learning approach to directly generate requisite data across chemical space [37] and improve the performance of their earlier extensible ANN potential [38]. Similarly, Botu and Ramprasad have provided an adaptive ML framework that might be used to guide dataset generation over configuration space [39]. Moreover, Herr et al. have shown how metadynamics can be used to train better and more transferable MLPs compared to those trained using configurations produced from unbiased MD or sampling of normal-mode motions [40]. Meanwhile, Chmiela and coworkers have achieved highly accurate, flexible molecular force fields using a limited amount (hundreds of conformations) of training data by incorporating physical symmetries in their gradient-domain ML approaches [33,41]. Ultimately, if such approaches allow high-quality results to be obtained from limited data, then higher-quality electronic structure methods can be employed to improve the overall accuracy of future simulations.
Approaches to coarse-grained modeling
Coarse-grained (CG) modeling is an essential component of soft matter research. The considerable success of ML techniques in the realms of electronic structure prediction and atomistic simulation is encouraging for applications to CG modeling, and application of ML approaches that facilitate CG simulation are now emerging.
Just as in ab initio simulations, MLPs have the potential to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and transferability of CG models. Building on their earlier work for ab initio simulations [30], Zhang and colleagues introduced a framework for developing many-body CG potentials based on ANN and used it to develop a CG water model that exhibited excellent agreement with ab initio simula
tions of DFT water [42]. Application of this or similar approaches for CG simulation of polymers or systems with more complex chemical topology is an exciting possibility. Using a different strategy, Lemke and Peter trained a ANN to predict conformational free energies of oligopeptides by creating a classification problem

between real conformations (obtained from atomistic simulation) and fake conformations (obtained from an arbitrary distribution) [43]. By employing a convolutional ANN architecture, their trained ANN model could be applied to longer oligopeptides; such an approach will be useful in future polymer-related work, since training data will be restricted to simulations of oligomers that are generally shorter than intended simulation targets.
Interestingly, developing MLPs for CG simulation may require more data compared to parameterizing an atomistic model. For Zhang et al., a trajectory of 15 ns was used for training the water CG MLP [42]. Because such a trajectory is computationally demanding for direct ab initio simulations, they first parameterized an accurate MLP for atomistic water, and this model generated the requisite data for training the CG model. Somewhat relatedly, the training data of Lemke and Peter was necessarily limited to shorter oligopeptides due to difficulties of obtaining converged MD data for longer oligopeptides, although including longer oligopeptides in the training data would have likely improved transferability of the model. Both cases suggest that simulation approaches that proceed through a hierarchy of system representations may be fruitfully applied for CG model development. The advent of methods that generate CG representations in an automated and systematic fashion should be useful to such efforts [44–46]. In addition,
training approaches that exploit symmetries [33,41] may help to reduce the amount of required data.
There are also opportunities to exploit ML algorithms in a multi-scale simulation setting, without analogy to atomistic simulation. The work by Jackson et al. provides one such example, in which the conformationally
dependent electronic structure (HOMO levels, dimer couplings, etc.) for model conjugated materials is predicted directly from CG degrees of freedom using an ANN [47] (see Figure 2). Combined with efficient CG simulations that can predict the morphological character of systems, such an approach enables characterization of the bulk electronic properties of photoactive materials. Continued development of multiscale simulation strategies that exploit ML at CG resolutions will be crucial to soft matter design efforts.
Enhanced simulation and analysis
Efficient exploration of configuration space and characterization of free energy landscapes is a critical concern in both atomistic and coarse-grained simulation of soft materials, making enhanced sampling methods [48] essential in many research efforts. Recent ML-enhanced approaches demonstrate great promise in improving upon existing enhanced sampling methods. Adaptive biasing techniques based on ANN — namely, the ANN sampling technique of Sidky et al. [49] and the Force-biasing Using Neural Networks technique of Guo, Sevgen, and coworkers [50] — have been shown to explore complex free energy landscapes in less time than conventional approaches. For a representative Gaussian landscape, the acceleration provided by the FUNN sampling technique amounts to an approximately two orders of magnitude increase over a traditional adaptive force-biasing approach [50]. Similarly, Zhang et al. utilized reinforcement learning to train a deep ANN representation of a free energy surface, which is also used to bias the simulation in regions of high certainty [51]. Already demonstrated for simple polymers and biomolecular systems, these methods hold obvious potential to explore the complex free energy landscapes in soft matter simulation. Moreover,

these methods enjoy synergy with the development of MLPs, which are well served by enhanced sampling methods to improve the quality and coverage of training data (Figure 3).
While the aforementioned sampling techniques use defined collective variables (CVs)[48], there is growing use of both unsupervised and supervised ML techniques for CV discovery or identification of effective descriptors of complex system behavior [26,52–55]. Unsupervised ML techniques, such as clustering techniques, have long been used in the development of Markov state models to analyze and identify important states and transitions in dynamical systems [56]. Jadrich and coworkers utilized principal component analysis to detect phase transitions in a variety of model systems [53,54]. Meanwhile, Schoenholz and coworkers utilized a support vector machine to identify a local structural metric, “softness”, that strongly correlates with observed glassy dynamics [52]. In addition, Sultan and Pande have recently addressed how one might initially identify good reaction coordinates or CVs based on local sampling of initial and final states using either support vector machines or logistic regression [57]. Nonlinear manifold learning techniques have also been applied for the purpose of CV discovery, with work by Guo et al. utilizing diffusion maps to extract the collective motions underlying nucleosome dynamics [58]. Finally, advancements that interleave the process of CV discovery and enhanced sampling have begun to emerge. In this direction, Chen et al. have demonstrated how autoencoders can be used for on-the-fly nonlinear CV discovery and employed directly in enhanced sampling (based on the existence of differentiable mappings of the molecular coordinates) [59]. Similarly, a recently developed method by Ribeiro and colleagues, termed RAVE, iteratively employs a deep learning framework of variational autoencoders to simultaneously identify and enhance sampling for a CV [60]. Given the challenges associated with identifying appropriate CVs for soft matter systems in tandem with rugged free energy landscapes, these ML methods provide new powerful approaches to studying complex systems.
In closing, it is important to highlight emerging work in which ML and optimization strategies are used in concert with molecular simulation to enhance the interpretation of experimental data. The origin of this simulation paradigm reaches back two decades, with examples spanning the use of neutron scattering and molecular simulation to iteratively derive atomistic water models [61], to the application of NMR-derived biasing constraints applied to molecular simulations of proteins [62]. Now, recent advances in datadriven ML and optimization techniques, in tandem with ever-improving experimental approaches, promise to combine in significant breakthroughs for understanding soft materials across lengthscales and timescales. Work by Khaira et al. for example, has developed an optimization
strategy that couples a theoretically-informed CG (TICG) model with CMA-ES to iteratively derive molecular simulation parameters that best reproduce experimental critical dimension SAXS data [63]. Jiang et al. used evolutionary optimization to minimize the difference between simulated and experimental trajectories to iteratively derive charge measurements of dielectric particles in electrostatically charged granular matter — details that would be

unobtainable in the absence of this modeling paradigm [64]. Finally, a set of techniques exist by which to explicitly bias simulated ensembles with experimental data [65], and we anticipate rapid development in the application of ML to the enhancement of these strategies.
Conclusions and outlook
Recent years have seen growing utilization of ML techniques for computational materials discovery. When properly applied, these methods can enable efficient identification and characterization of promising novel materials. However, the intrinsically hierarchical nature of soft materials design requires simulation over multiple spatiotemporal scales, as well as effective descriptions of complex many-body interactions underpinning emergent phenomena, which have slowed progress relative to other materials classes. Recent developments exploiting ML techniques suggest that we are poised to embrace such challenges and enhance capabilities of designing soft materials.
For data-driven property prediction and chemical discovery, the existing and considerable work on molecular descriptors must be extended beyond the domain of conventional molecular length and timescales, such that they can be fruitfully applied to multiscale macromolecular and soft matter systems. Critical to this effort will be the development and utilization of soft material databases, [11,22,23] such that generative design frameworks enabled by ML methods might be exploited with a success similar to that observed for hard materials and small molecules. Decisions on the constitution and variety of such databases must be carefully deliberated to derive maximum utility for the soft materials community. In the realm of simulation enhancement and analysis, developments in MLPs continue to make accurate atomistic simulations more affordable, and comparable MLP methodologies for CG modeling must be developed such that multiscale simulations of similar accuracy may be leveraged. The development of ML methodologies at specific lengthscales and timescales, in addition to those that link more conventional simulation efforts across spatiotemporal scales, will be key to this effort. Parallel to enhancements in the accuracy and expediency of molecular modeling will be advances in the analysis and interpretation of complex systems for which conventional approaches and the capabilities of human intuition are insufficient. Both supervised and unsupervised techniques have begun to emerge in this regard, but methodologies that effectively address the implicit hierarchies in soft materials will be critical for rational design. Finally, the synthesis of molecular simulation and ML for the enhanced interpretation of experimental data is an emerging frontier, which may prove most useful to the soft matter community due to both the ubiquity of molecular modeling techniques, as well as the diversity of soft materials and their relevant experimental
characterizations. In all of these cases, researchers will need to continually evaluate what is the best representation of data, which ML algorithm is most suitable for the application, and how extensible is the approach. Synthesis of all these advancements and continued innovation are promising towards the goal of multiscale soft materials design.
