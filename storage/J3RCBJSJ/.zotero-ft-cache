ABSTRACT: The parametrization and validation of the OPLS3 force field for small molecules and proteins are reported. Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of offatom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein−ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.
I. INTRODUCTION
Realistic atomistic simulation of complex molecular systems is contingent upon the availability of an accurate and reliable molecular mechanics force field. The treatment of systems of interest in biology and materials science typically requires models on the order of thousands to millions of atoms and time scales from nanoseconds to seconds; even at the low end of both of these ranges, purely quantum mechanical dynamics is extremely expensive (and not necessarily more accurate, as quantum chemical methods that are tractable for systems of this size have deficiencies of their own). Hence, molecular mechanics force field development has been a central goal of computational chemistry for the past four decades. Force field development is a highly challenging, laborintensive effort; it takes large groups working together, over an extended time period, to produce a model that is useful in addressing practical problems. Beginning in the early 1980s, a number of force fields have emerged as the result of such collective efforts. In the biomolecular simulation area (which will be the main focus of the present work), these force fields
include a number of variants of the OPLS,1−4 AMBER,5−10
CHARMM,11,12 and Gromos13,14 potential energy functions. All of these force fields share certain basic characteristics: they rely on a fixed charge (as opposed to explicitly polarizable)
electrostatic model, they employ a standard (Lennard-Jones 6− 12) van der Waals potential to model electronic repulsion and dispersive nonbonded interactions, and they utilize harmonic stretching and bending terms, and dihedral angle based torsional potentials, to model the valence component of the energy. Ultimately, explicit inclusion of polarization effects will be required to achieve the best fidelity with the actual underlying physics of the system; however, parametrization of a polarizable force field adds considerable additional complexity, and fixed charge models have proven to be capable of far more precision, in a wide range of applications, than one might have originally
surmised.15−22 Hence the aforementioned force field development groups have continued to focus on producing the best possible fixed charge model, as manifested by comparison to experimental data.2,8,10,12,23,24 As well as being deployed as the workhorse solutions in current modeling projects, such models serve as benchmarks for the coming generations of polarizable
force fields.25−28 A truly compelling polarizable model must reproduce the (very extensive) successes of fixed charge

models, as well as improving the results in cases where explicit polarization is important to achieving high accuracy. In the present paper, we describe the development of a new generation of models based on the OPLS force field of
Jorgensen and co-workers.3,4 OPLS was one of the first models in which parameters were extensively optimized to reproduce liquid state thermodynamic properties for a variety of small organic molecules; this approach has been subsequently adopted by many of the force field development groups noted above. These efforts yielded a core set of nonbonded (van der Waals) parameters, which still remain at the heart of
OPLS development, including the OPLS_2005,1 OPLS2.1,22,29 and OPLS3 parametrizations discussed below. However, other components of the force field and associated development protocols have been substantially enhanced based on improvements in the underlying software and technologies used in their parametrization and the exponential growth of computing power. The key improvements discussed below are as follows: (1) Extensive use of high quality quantum chemical calculations to generate more accurate valence and torsional parametrizations. The OPLS3 model contains nearly 2 orders of magnitude more explicitly fit torsional parameters than alternative small molecule force fields. (2) Improvements of the charge model, including the use of
a CM1A-BCC methodology30,31 to compute partial charges, and incorporation of virtual (off-atom centered) sites to better represent lone pair and sigma hole charge distributions. (3) The development of an improved protein force field. (4) Extensive testing of the models against large data sets of small molecule, protein, and protein−ligand conformations and energetics. These comparisons guide key heuristic assumptions made in the models and ultimately provide validation of the model without further parameter adjustment. A novel aspect of the present work is the use of free energy perturbation (FEP) theory to evaluate the ability of the force field to predict protein−ligand binding affinities. The FEP data set used here includes hundreds of ligands and multiple protein target classes and enables us to benchmark both the protein and small molecule models in the force field. The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we review the functional form of the OPLS force field family, briefly discuss the heuristic assumptions inherent in using a functional form of this type, and outline the protocol used for parameter development, again discussing the rationale for the approaches we have taken as well as the mechanics. Section III presents the major development efforts focused on the valence parametrization and the nonbonded parametrization, including the new charge model. These sections include a discussion of the small molecule quantum chemical and experimental data sets used for the parametrization and accuracy benchmarks achieved for different versions of the force field in both training sets and test sets. This section also includes a discussion of the parametrization protocol used in the development of the protein force field including investigations of protein stability under simulation for a wide variety of structures, examining a significant fraction of the standard test cases used for this purpose in the literature. Although, improvement of the OPLS protein force field has received less attention than for
CHARMM and AMBER over the past decade,2,23,24 the major revision of the protein force field in OPLS3 reported here appears to display performance that is competitive with the state of the art.
Section IV presents FEP calculations for a large and diverse set of ligands and receptors, comparing with experimental binding affinity data. The data was not used to optimize the force field parameters and hence constitutes an unbiased evaluation of both protein and small molecule force field quality. We compare results to earlier variants of the OPLS force field (OPLS_2005, OPLS2.1), enabling the accuracy of the results to be assessed as various upgrades to the force field are implemented. This data shows very significant improvement as the functional form and parametrization of the model are improved; furthermore, in many cases, large outliers are eliminated by the modifications of the force field and afford a straightforward physical interpretation. The results for the most recent version of the force field and sampling protocol display an RMS error suggesting that, for the first time, the errors in the simulation are approaching estimates, perhaps within a factor of 2, of the experimental error. Further improvements in both the force field and the sampling protocol will be required to achieve results at this level. However, the robustness of the methodology and systematic reduction in errors obtained via force field modification are highly encouraging with regard to deployment of FEP and related methods in projects such as drug discovery and materials simulation. We consider in more detail the theoretical and practical implications of the current results in section V, the Discussion. Section VI, the Conclusion, summarizes the results and discusses future directions.

Bond stretch and angle bending energies are represented by harmonic terms where the subscript eq denotes the equilibrium bond length r and angle θ. The torsion term is represented by a truncated Fourier series that sums over all dihedral angles. Nonbonded energies are represented by sums over Coulomb and Lennard-Jones terms covering pairwise interactions between available interacting sites (denoted i and j). For intramolecular atom pairs separated by 3 bonds or less the energy is scaled by fij. The Lennard-Jones sigma and epsilon
parameters for each ij pair are based on atom site-specific parameters coupled according to the geometric combining
rule.3 Note, in OPLS3, partial charges may also lie on virtual interaction sites that are associated but not coincident with an
atomic position.28,32 As we will demonstrate below, virtual sites provide a demonstrable improvement in the performance of the force field in computing protein−ligand binding affinities, thus establishing their importance in the electrostatic component of the model.

The model implied by eq 1 above contains a large number of parameters, which must be fit to experimental or quantum chemical data. As our objective is to obtain as close to full coverage of medicinal chemistry space for small molecules as is feasible, we will need to incorporate a very large number of parameters, the vast majority of which will not have experimental data available. Our general fitting protocol (augmented for the protein force field as described in section III), adapted to this reality, can be outlined as follows: (1) The stretching and bend terms are fit to quantum chemical data. These terms are insensitive to the other terms in the force field and so are determined as the first step in the protocol. (2) The van der Waals terms are obtained from liquid state simulations, along with the core charge set used in the liquid simulations. (3) Bond charge corrections (BCC’s) for the CM1A-BCC charge model are defined and tested (using, for example, calculations of solvation free energies in water). (4) Finally, in the last step the torsional parameters are fit to quantum chemical data. The protocol defined above can be applied to model compounds for which there is no experimental data, as long as the van der Waals parameters are well covered by the current force field. In doing so, a number of key assumptions are being made with regard to whether significant predictive power compared to experiment will be created. These assumptions can be summarized as follows: (1) Classical treatment of nuclear motion does not systematically distort results as compared to experiment. This assumption is inherent in any classically based simulation methodology. Its validity relies on a combination of three factors: (a) the quantum correction of the effective potential energy surface for nuclear motion is relatively small, (b) some corrections are empirically built into the force field due to fitting to experiment, and (c) for quantities of interest such as binding free energies, there is cancellation of error, i.e. if the direction and magnitude of the error in the unbound state is very similar to the direction and magnitude of the error in the bound state, there will be little impact on the free energy difference. We do not investigate this assumption explicitly but note it here as a potential contributor to any discrepancy with experiment. (2) The use of a fixed charge force field provides an adequate description of electrostatic interactions in the condensed phase problems of interest. Fixed charge force fields require building an “average” polarization into the charge model by using partial charges that are somewhat larger than what would be obtained in a converged gas phase calculation of the quantum mechanical charge distribution; the classic example is water, where the use of a gas phase model leads to a drastic underestimation of the
cohesiveness of liquid water.33 For the protein and water force fields discussed below, the charge model is optimized against condensed phase experimental data via small molecule liquid state simulations. Protein and water constitute the vast majority of atoms in a simulation. Thus, it makes sense that physically reasonable structures and energies emerge given the tuning of average polarization. For an arbitrary ligand, in contrast, we cannot be certain how well the CM1A-BCC model represents average polarization; the model is tuned to reproduce small molecule solvation free energies as well as ab initio gas phase properties that have been shown to correlate with charges tuned for average condensed
phase polarization,30 but the accuracy of transferability to new chemistries is difficult to rigorously calibrate. However, it is logical to expect that relatively modest errors in scaling ligand charges would exhibit significant cancellation for properties like binding affinity, as characterized by several
groups.34,35 If, for example, the hydrogen bond strengths are underestimated in water (because perhaps the assigned partial charges are too small), one would also see weaker hydrogen bonds when the ligand interacts with the protein. If, as appears to be the case for the overwhelming majority of biologically active ligands, all of their polar groups satisfy their hydrogen bonding needs one way or another, then cancellation of error will be observed. (3) Torsional terms fit to the gas phase potential surface can be transferred to the condensed phase with minimal errors. This hypothesis requires only that the change in potential energy as a function of torsion angle is well represented by the nonbonded interaction terms in the force field. (4) The contribution of fundamentally nonclassical quantum mechanical nonbonded interactions, such as oxygen−sulfur interactions, π−π interactions, and nonlinear vdW coupling, is negligible. This approximation is admittedly without firm justification, and multiple exceptions have from time to time been reported, but the extraordinary success of molecular mechanics across a wide variety of problem classes suggests it may be viable. The above approximations are heuristic and uncontrolled in nature, as opposed to systematic approximations, which can be removed via greater computational effort. The accuracy of these approximations therefore must be investigated by comparison with experimental data, which is not used as a part of the parametrization process. Over the past decade, an extensive (although far from complete) set of tests has been used to assess the current state of the art protein force fields. Many of these tests have focused on native state structural stability, while others have assessed
capacity for modeling conformational fluctuations.23,24 The tests have revealed substantial progress in accuracy in describing ordered structures though issues in accurately
capturing propensities of disordered states remain an issue.36 A principal objective of the present paper is to subject our revised version of the OPLS protein force field to tests of this type and present comparisons with the more recent versions of the AMBER and CHARMM force fields. Recent studies have noted weaknesses in the capacity of earlier variants of the OPLS
protein force field to model the ordered states of proteins.2,23,24 In contrast, as will be shown below, OPLS3 is competitive with the best results obtained from AMBER or CHARMM variants for the set of observables presented herein. As in the case of liquid water, protein force field development has benefitted from the ability to incorporate extensive experimental data into the parametrization, particularly the nonbonded terms. The amide backbone can be modeled as Nmethylacetamide, for which there is extensive experimental data. Many of the side chains similarly have small molecule analogues which have been studied experimentally in detail, e.g. the hydroxyl group in serine and threonine uses parameters developed in the simulation of methanol, phenylalanine exploits benzene parameters, etc. The nonbonded parameters thus have been fitted to thermodynamic liquid state data (heat of vaporization and density). Such fitting makes it more likely that approximation (2) discussed above will yield acceptable results in predicting condensed phase experimental properties.

The situation is quite different with regard to developing a force field for small molecules, which provides full coverage of medicinal chemistry space. Thermodynamic data, and aqueous solvation free energy data, that goes beyond amino acid analogues is available and can be used to guide the fitting
protocol and to optimize a subset of parameters.37,38 However, this data set describes only a tiny fraction of the chemistries that are used in medicinal chemistry projects. The accuracy for chemistries outside of those with direct analogues is then dependent upon the transferability of the van der Waals parameters (as implied by the atom typing algorithm) and the ability of the CM1A-BCC charge model (in conjunction with the van der Waals parameters) to depict electrostatics. It has historically been difficult to broadly calibrate the errors in general small molecule force fields; the challenge lies in making relevant contact with experiment for a sufficient number and diversity of test cases. In the present paper, we take a major step forward toward this objective by using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods to assess the accuracy of three different versions of the OPLS force field in predicting protein−ligand binding affinities. In a recent paper, we have shown that our current FEP simulation methodology delivers very good correlation with experimental binding data for a large
and diverse test set of protein−ligand complexes.22 Here we follow up these results by investigating whether systematic improvement of the force field leads to a similar systematic improvement in binding affinity prediction. The data presented below validates the hypothesis of systematic improvement in a remarkably consistent fashion, for a wide range of test cases. The combination of a low absolute RMS error versus experiment with the systematic improvement with force field model quality noted above in turn provides compelling evidence that the core approximations of the force field model (ignoring nuclear quantum effects, lack of an explicit treatment of polarization, etc.) are not the leading source of error in these comparisons. It is no doubt possible to find individual cases in a condensed phase simulation where one or more of these factors leads to serious problems; our results, however, demonstrate that such cases are infrequent, at least in the case of protein−ligand binding for compounds taken from the medicinal chemistry literature. The results similarly validate the detailed fitting protocols that we use to build the models, as well as the quality of phase space sampling (which if insufficient would overwhelm any correlation with experiment). Further discussion of these points, which have significant implications not only for use of the current OPLS3 force field but also for the optimal direction of future force field development efforts, is provided in section V.
III. THE OPLS3 FORCE FIELD DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL
A. Overview. Unlike proteins, where the number of naturally occurring amino acids limits chemical diversity, the primary challenge in developing accurate and reliable force fields for small molecules is parametrically covering the vast space of chemical functionalities that compose them. Our general approach, discussed in parts B−E below, aims to address this issue by leveraging a growing data set of quantum mechanically derived observables that sensitively probe the components of the force field. Development of the protein force field is covered in part F.
B. Bond Stretching and Angle Bending Terms. Stretching and bending terms require two types of parameters:
a second derivative of the energy expanded around the minimum value (bond length or bend angle), which defines a force constant for the motion in question, and the minimum itself. Each parameter set is assigned to a specific stretch or bend type, comprised of a pair or triplet of atoms (with their particular atom type and an index specifying other features of the chemical environment like the bond order). OPLS3 has a substantially larger number of stretch/bend parameter types as compared to alternative force fields in the literature: 1187 stretching types and 15236 bending types. The parameters themselves are obtained from fitting to quantum chemical data for model compounds, as well as crystallographic data where available. Each stretch or bend type has a different minimum value; however, many types have the same force constant. The second derivatives do not have to be highly precise, because they represent a relatively small energy scale (although we continue to add new second derivative
parameters in important cases, such as biaryl rings).39 In contrast, a rather modest error in the equilibrium geometry can result in poor evaluation of strain energies for complex molecules. Second derivatives and minimum geometrical values are obtained by performing DFT calculations at the B3LYP/631G* level. DFT calculations are of sufficient accuracy for the determination of force constants, bond lengths, and bond angles for the vast majority of systems covered by OPLS3. We routinely add additional stretch and bend types to the force field, on an ongoing basis, as problems are discovered for novel chemistries. Table 1 lists the number of stretch and bend parameters for the four force fields considered in this section: MMFF,
OPLS_2005, OPLS2.1, and OPLS3. The number of parameters has grown steadily as the OPLS force field has evolved, reaching nearly an order of magnitude more parameters of these types compared to MMFF. In addition to providing a consistently superior description of medicinal chemistry compounds, the breadth of OPLS3 coverage has significant implications for materials modeling, for example polymer simulations. As shown in ref 40, the use of improved bending parameters is critical to subsequent accurate description of torsions in substituted conjugated polymers. We will consider systems of this type in more detail in forthcoming publications. C. Determination of Torsional Parameters. Torsional parameters are needed to describe the quantum mechanical effects associated with stereoelectronic effects and resonance structures. We here utilize the standard truncated Fourier series form of the torsional potential, which requires fitting the parameters V1−4 from eq 1. Parameters are determined for each
atom specified quartet (torsion type) by fitting to quantum chemical data for model molecules. However, the 1−4 scale factor fij in eq 1 must be chosen based on other, more general considerations; for most torsions, the remaining parameters can be adjusted to provide reasonable RMS errors for a relatively wide range of f values (e.g., between 0.5 and 1.0).

with the protein force field (discussed in section E below) indicated that a value of 0.5 provided better stability over a range of protein structures in molecular dynamics simulations than did an alternative value (0.833) that had previously been used in OPLS2.1. There are three plausible quantum chemical methods that can be used to generate the fitting data: coupled cluster (CCSD(T)), density functional theory, and various versions of second order perturbation theory (MP2, LMP2). CCSD(T) is the most accurate method, but the computation time required to determine tens of thousands of torsional profiles for the model compounds in our data set would be prohibitive. Recent versions of DFT, such as M06-2X, and second order perturbation theory methods, such as LMP2, are of comparable accuracy for the calculation of conformational energies, and further both are sufficient, in terms of computational efficiency, to enable the evaluation of the large number of molecules
described herein.41 As such, we have here chosen to utilize the localized MP2 (LMP2) methodology in Jaguar to generate the quantum chemical torsional profiles. The accuracy of LMP2 for conformational energies has been discussed in previous
papers;41,42 the computational efficiency of Jaguar LMP2 (approximately 20 min for one torsional scan for a typical molecule in the database) enables it to be deployed across the large training and test sets used in the present paper. The quantum chemical torsional profiles used in force field fitting are generated as follows: 1. Force field based torsion scans (in 30 degree increments) are developed from low energy conformers and used as the starting geometries for subsequent QM optimization. 2. The quantum chemical profile is resolved via restrained optimization of the molecule at the B3LYP/631G* level for each discretized value of the dihedral angle. 3. Single point LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f) calculations are used to resolve the reference energy surface. In our LMP2 implementation, special care is taken to delocalize the virtual space when the wave function itself is strongly delocalized (as in an aromatic ring). Having specified the functional form of the torsional term and the quantum chemical methodology to be used in generating benchmark data, the next key issue is construction of a set of model compounds that will be used in the fitting process. The first step is to select the torsion types, based on atom quartets in which each atom is classified according to an atom-typing scheme, for which parameters are to be derived. Initially, we generated statistics for a 6 M compound data set of purchasable drug-like molecules, ranking various atom quartets by frequency of occurrence. The top 45K were targeted for parameter fitting. Subsequently, we have continued to add torsion types based on the need for differentiation of specific chemical structures (creating new atom types as necessary), structures that have come up in internal projects and drug discovery collaborations, and input from external users of our software. The number of torsion types currently in OPLS3, as well as MMFF, OPLS_2005, and OPLS2.1, are shown in Table 1. Once a torsion type is targeted for parameter fitting, the next step is to identify a model compound from which to derive parameters. Our approach to this problem is as follows: (1) Identify one or more compounds that contain the torsion in question from the large database noted above. (2) Reduce the model to the minimal structure containing the stipulated torsion type. If the molecule is too large, the
amount of computation time required to generate the torsional potential will become prohibitive; in addition, torsional profiles in large molecules become very complicated and interact with other degrees of freedom in the molecule (a problem that a minimal molecule reduces as much as is possible). (3) Select the reduced model that occurs most frequently in the database noted above. In total, benchmark profiles for 11,845 model molecules have been used in the parametrization of OPLS3. Model molecules will invariably contain more than one torsion type defining the torsional profile, even for molecules containing only a single freely rotating dihedral angle. To account for such coupling, the fitting process divides the training set into clusters with interdependent torsion types prior to fitting. At this stage, each individual model molecule calculation is very rapid, requiring only classical small molecule calculations. Various technical problems can arise with respect to convergence (of both the quantum chemical data and classical optimization and fitting process), but these can be overcome with sufficient automation and optimization of the relevant software. The results shown below reflect a major effort along these lines. The quality of the results can first be calibrated by the RMS error of the restrained torsional profile around the specified model molecule bond, as compared to the quantum chemical profile, averaged over the range of the dihedral angle, for all model molecules in the training set. The distribution of RMS errors reflects the accuracy of the fitting of the classical functional form to the quantum chemical data. Table 2 reports
RMS error distributions for the OPLS3 training set. As expected, the OPLS3 RMS errors are very small in the great majority of cases. The consistency with OPLS2.1 reflects a training set that is largely the same between the respective models. Both OPLS_2005 and MMFF display a high fraction of cases in which the RMS error is large (greater than 2 kcal/ mol). These results reveal the major deficiencies in the older force fields; a very high fraction of molecules is going to have at least one very inaccurate torsional parameter, and many will have more than one. Parameter transferability is assessed against additional data sets that enumerate relative energies between conformational minima. Three such sets of molecules are investigated: 1. Molecules are in common with the OPLS3 training set. 2. Molecules that differ from the training set with constituent torsion types fully covered by OPLS3. 3. Molecules that contain torsion types not well covered by OPLS3. Structures are developed from force field based conformational searches followed by unrestrained B3LYP/6-31G* optimizations. QM energies are evaluated using the LMP2 level discussed above. Torsion restraints are applied to the respective force field based minimizations. Corresponding RMS errors are reported in Table 3. Not surprisingly the OPLS3 error correlates with data

set similarity to the torsion training set. Good accuracy is seen when the constituent torsions of a molecule are fully covered by OPLS3 fitted torsion types (RMSE ∼ 1 kcal/mol), and poor accuracy is seen otherwise (RMSE ∼ 2 kcal/mol). An analysis of the 6 M compound database of drug-like molecules discussed above indicates that 93% of the torsional bonds found in drug-like molecules are well covered by OPLS3 fitted types. Poor accuracy (similar to when OPLS3 has poor coverage) is seen across all data sets for both OPLS_2005 and MMFF. The results shown above demonstrate that OPLS3 is much better able to represent the conformational propensities of organic molecules relevant to medicinal chemistry than older force fields such as OPLS_2005 and MMFF (or any molecular mechanics force field that does not contain tens of thousands of torsional parameters). However, the coverage of OPLS3 is not complete; we estimate that the probability that a typical new molecule of interest in a drug discovery program will have at least one missing torsion is 33%. To provide coverage for these cases, we have developed an automated version of our fitting protocol, which can be deployed by users to generate high quality parameters for such “missing” torsions (i.e., those which our atom typing software identifies as not possessing a good match in our parameter database). We have tested this module, referred to herein as the FFBuilder, on a wide variety of molecules. Validation results for FFBuilder are summarized in Table 4.
The combination of OPLS3 and the FFBuilder provides an accurate and reliable solution to the problem of assigning torsional parameters across a wide range of organic compounds. The CPU time required to run the FFBuilder for a single torsion is typically less than 1 h in with a modest computational investment (12 CPUs). This is quite small when compared to, for example, the computational effort required for an FEP simulation. It is important to note that without the extensive torsional parametrization found in OPLS3, it would be much more difficult (requiring an order of magnitude more computation) to use the FFBuilder technology to complete the force field in an automated fashion.
D. van der Waals Parameters. The van der Waals parameters are those developed by the Jorgensen group,
primarily based on liquid state simulations of small organic
molecules.3,43−45 OPLS3 has a total of 124 atom types with different van der Waals parameter sets (Lennard-Jones σ and ε values). Parameters for sulfides and disulfides are based on the Kaminski et al. revision of OPLS-AA,1 while ion parameters were taken from Jensen and Jorgensen.46 These parameters are used in all three OPLS variants that we discuss herein. E. Charge Model. The OPLS3 force field employs a CM1A-BCC based charge model that was initially introduced with OPLS2.0.29 The model is based on a combination of Cramer-Truhlar CM1A charges31 with specifically fit bond charge correction terms (BCC). Up through OPLS2.1,22 this model has employed atom-centered partial charges to represent the molecular charge distribution. In OPLS3, we introduce virtual (off-atom centered) sites for aromatic ring nitrogens and aryl halogens excluding fluorine; we show below that this augmentation of the charge model yields important quantifiable improvements in the prediction of binding free energy. The BCC corrections are fit to reproduce both QM electrostatic potentials (using HF/6-31G* over the 11,845 model compounds used for torsional fitting and an additional 357 aromatic rings) as well as solvation free energies for 153 molecules for which experimental data is available. BCC’s can range in magnitude from close to zero to nearly a full elementary charge. Protein charges, treated specially, conform to values published by Kaminski et al. for OPLS-AA/L.1 For the presently covered functional groups, the geometry of the off-site charge is defined in 2 ways. For aryl halides the offsite charge is located along the carbon-halide bond vector, distal to the aromatic ring. The distance between the halide atom and the off-site charge is 1.6 Å for chlorine and bromine and 1.8 Å for iodine. For the aromatic divalent nitrogens (n) bonded to atoms x1 and x2, the off-site charge resides in the plane formed by these three atoms, 0.4 Å from the nitrogen along the bisector of the x1−n−x2 angle. The geometries are consistent with those developed by Jorgensen et al.32 for aryl halides and by Harder et al. for the aryl nitrogens28 and are illustrated in Figure 1.

A BCC between the parent real atom and the off-site charge defines the partial charge assigned to the virtual site. That BCC parameter along with additional intraring BCC’s are fit to minimize the difference in the electrostatic potential (ESP) with respect to HF/6-31G*. The fitted parameters are subject to restraints (with respect to a BCC values of zero). Comparison against experimental condensed phase data is used to calibrate the strength of the restraint for a handful of test cases (pyridine, pyrimidine, pyridazine, pyrazole, oxazole, chlorobenzene). A total of 357 ring fragments including 81 monocycles and 256 fused rings were used in the present parametrization. The present round of charge fitting also included aromatic heterocycles not containing virtual site parameters (like thiophene and furan). The average ESP RMSD over these training set molecules drops to 1.2 kcal/mol/e for OPLS3 versus 2.2 kcal/mol/e for OPLS2.1. Preliminary testing with adding virtual sites to hydroxyl oxygen indicated only marginal impact, which is consistent with
the observations concerning alcohols made previously.28 This work also found that off-site charges added little to improve model accuracy of amide carbonyl oxygens. These results suggest that the partial charge distribution around oxygen is sufficiently close to spherical for the off-site charges to be of limited importance. The semiempirical quantum chemistry in conjunction with the parametrized BCC corrections does a reasonable job in many cases in reorganizing the charge distribution in response to these sorts of modifications. For applications where rapid computation of the force field parameters is required, the speed of a semiempirical calculation as compared to ab initio methods is highly relevant. For cases where the force field model is to be used in an expensive simulation such as FEP, one could employ ab initio quantum mechanics to compute charge distributions directly (rather than making BCC corrections). We intend to pursue this direction in future work. For the present, it is useful to calibrate the accuracy and reliability of the BCC model by comparing the FEP results to experiment, as is done below and in section IV. A useful initial test of the accuracy of the charge model is obtained by computing the aqueous solvation free energies of small molecules via FEP. The aggregate results obtained with OPLS3 are very similar to those published previously for
OPLS2.0 (unchanged in OPLS2.1);29 the accuracy versus experiment is summarized in Table 5 and compared to OPLS_2005, CHARMM, and AMBER. Table 6 highlights a small number of cases where the solvation free energy result is impacted by the addition of virtual sites; significant improvement in these cases is observed. Overall, OPLS3 yields accurate
solvation free energies for an expansive set of molecules, suggesting a capacity for high performance in protein−ligand binding (where a reliable description of solvation is important).
Consistent with the OPLS2.0 work cited above,29 we employ the SPC water model for all simulation-based results presented herein though previous work has shown that there is relatively little sensitivity to the choice of water model in computed
aqueous hydration free energies.47 As noted above, the fixed charge form of the charge model employed in OPLS3 represents a significant heuristic approximation. History has shown that fitting nonbonded parameters for fixed charge models to condensed phase properties is a reliable means of creating transferable parameters, the lineage of water models being the bestknown example. However, such systems comprise only a small fraction of the chemical space OPLS3 aims to cover. In order to validate the computational fitting methods discussed above, we turn to FEP calculations of protein−ligand binding systems as described in section IV.
F. Protein Force Field Development. For predictive biomolecular simulation, the protein force field must be refined to a very high degree of accuracy and stability. Small errors in, for example, the torsional potential of the protein dihedral angles, can translate into significant disagreements with experiment, ranging from discrepancies in the prediction of NMR spectra to incorrect prediction of the stability of proteins and peptides. Over the past decade, the CHARMM and AMBER force fields have incorporated a greatly increased amount of quantum chemical data, and training to simulation data as compared with experiment, to produce protein force fields of substantially higher quality and reliability than those available 20 years ago. The OPLS3 protein force field represents a similar upgrade of the OPLS force field and employs similar data sets and techniques to achieve improved fidelity. We briefly describe the methodology and results in what follows. The protein partial charges and van der Waals parameters are retained from older version of OPLS; we use the parameters
reported in Kaminski et al.1 These parameters were developed over many years, primarily by fitting to small molecule liquid state data. This parametrization to experiment is important in the context of simulation of a marginally stable protein structure, in which an unbalanced set of nonbonded terms

can easily lead to poor stabilization of appropriate secondary and tertiary structures. The largest changes were implemented in the torsional parameters. First after some experimentation, we reverted to a 1−4 scale factor of 0.5 (0.833 was used in OPLS2.0 and OPLS2.1). Second, we refit the backbone torsions to a larger set of quantum chemical data with better coverage of phase space. The side chain torsions were also refit to new quantum chemical data, with additional refinement so as to reproduce torsion angle distributions observed in PDB structures as discussed below. Nonglycine/proline backbone torsions were fit against alanine dipeptide QM energy data over a set of 2391 structures. This set includes 324 states spanning the phi/psi space in regular 20-degree increments. An additional 2067 structures were sampled from a high temperature (T = 340 K) molecular dynamics simulation of alanine dipeptide in explicit water. All conformations were energy-minimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level with constraints applied to the phi and psi dihedrals followed by single point LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f). All nonglycine/ proline residues employed the same set of backbone phi/psi torsion parameters. Table 7 presents results comparing the RMS error for the 2391 structures in the training set for OPLS3 and OPLS2.1. We
also used a set of 1700 alanine tetrapeptide structures as a test set; the RMS error for these structures for both force fields is also shown in Table 7. The large improvement in RMS error in OPLS3 is apparent. Further reduction of the error is possible for example by using a numerical two-dimensional form of the backbone torsional potential; however, as discussed in detail in ref 48, it appears as though at some point there are diminishing returns to fitting quantum chemical data with increasing accuracy. Glycine backbone torsions were fit against 703 glycine dipeptide structures spanning the phi/psi space in regular 10 degree increments with energies calculated at the LMP2/ccpVTZ(-f) level from B3LYP/6-31G* optimized structures. Proline backbone phi torsion parameters were based on an energy scan of the proline dipeptide. Three distinct sets of psi torsion parameters were defined and parametrized based on tripeptides where psi interfaces between: two prolines, prolineglycine, and proline-alanine. Residue specific side chain torsions were predominantly fit against chi1 and chi2 dipeptide torsion scans (30-degree increments) averaging over two one-dimensional scans with the backbone phi/psi in either the alpha or beta backbone state. Charged residues were based on fits to the beta conformer alone. The fits of ASP chi1, ARG chi1, and GLU chi2 were additionally tuned by comparing simulated propensities (averaging over all ASP, ARG, GLU’s in gb3, ubiquitin, crambin, bpti, sumo2, lysozyme, and trp-cage) to propensities observed in 5307 high resolution PDB structures. Table 8 displays RMS errors over all side chains for OPLS2.1 and
OPLS3 as compared to the quantum chemical benchmark data. As in the case of the backbone, there is significant reduction of the RMS error. Figure 2 compares the torsional distributions for the key residues Asp, Arg, and Glu for OPLS3 and OPLS2.1 to
experimental distributions observed in the PDB. As can be seen, these distributions are much improved in OPLS3. A consequence of these improved distributions can be seen in the simulation of GB3 using OPLS3 and OPLS2.1. There is a key Asp residue in one of the GB3 helices, where the native rotamer state is disfavored (incorrectly) by OPLS2.1. This inaccuracy in the torsional potential plays a significant role in the destabilization of the helix in the OPLS2.1 simulation. A comparison of the problematic structure observed in the OPLS2.1 simulation versus the more native-like structure observed in the OPLS3 simulation is shown in Figure 3.

To assess the fidelity of simulated protein structures we investigated structural propensities of three short peptides and structural stability (as measured by RMSD to experiment) of a set of seven small proteins. The short peptides include two
helix forming peptides (AAQAA,49 K1950,51) and CLN025,52 which forms a hairpin-like structure at lower temperatures. In total, 3.2 μs of simulated tempering MD simulations were run for AAQAA and CLN025. Results for K19 are based on three independent 200 ns simulations. The helical content of AAQAA, K19, and folded fraction of CLN025 as compared to experiment is summarized in Table 9. The OPLS_2005 and
OPLS2.1 force fields clearly underestimate the ordered propensities to a significant degree not seen with recent
variants of the CHARMM (C22*)53 and Amber force fields
(AMBER99sb-ILDN).7 In contrast, OPLS3 fairs reasonably well in line with the relatively good agreement observed with
CHARMM (C22*).53
Table 10 summarizes results for the protein structural stability test. Each system was run in triplicate for 200 ns starting from different random seeds. The RMSD’s reported in the table are averaged over the last 100 ns of the respective simulations. The OPLS3 results are significantly improved compared to OPLS_2005 and OPLS2.1. The same CHARMM
(C22*)53 and Amber force fields (AMBER99sb-ILDN)7 discussed above are also included, against which OPLS3 is fully competitive. While there is much more work to be done in calibrating the performance of the OPLS3 protein force field, the present results provide preliminary evidence that it now performs at the state of the art for protein models. Additional testing of OPLS3 is presented below when we discuss the dependence of FEP results upon the protein force field. These comparisons represent a true unbiased test of the model, as no adjustment of protein force field parameters was performed in response to FEP data.
IV. APPLICATION TO PROTEIN−LIGAND BINDING
In ref 22, we presented a large set of FEP calculations of protein−ligand binding affinities using the OPLS2.1 force field. In addition to the improvements in the small molecule parametrization present in OPLS2.1, a number of other important advances were combined to enable a remarkable improvement in the consistency and accuracy of FEP results. These include implementation on a GPU platform, the use of the REST approach to accelerate conformational sampling of
Figure 3. Distributions at left contrast simulated propensity of ASP chi1 across 7 protein simulations against propensities seen across 5307 X-ray crystal structures. OPLS2.1 overstabilizes the chi1 = 90 rotamer which leads to competition with intrahelix hydrogen bonding in ASP36 of GB3 (center) and a concerted unfolding of the helix after 50 ns of simulation. In contrast the same instability is not seen with OPLS3, which has well balanced ASP rotamer populations.

the complex, and an automated interface for set up of FEP jobs and error analysis via cycle closure calculations. Details of these various aspects of our FEP methodology are provided in ref 22 and will be expanded upon in upcoming publications. Our primary objective in the present paper is to examine the effects of improvements in the force field on the accuracy of FEP calculations. To that end, we present a statistical summary of FEP performance across a wide range of data sets for OPLS_2005, OPLS2.1, and OPLS3, presented in Table 11. The change in RMS error from OPLS_2005 to OPLS2.1 and then to OPLS3 is substantial. The principal sources of improvement in OPLS2.1, as compared to OPLS_2005, are the ligand partial charges and torsional parameters. In OPLS3, improvement is driven by enhancements made to the protein
force field and addition of virtual sites coupled with a more extensive parametrization of heterocyclic systems. All of these factors are significant across the entire data set; for a given molecule, one or two may be dominant. As our purpose here is to highlight the advances in OPLS3, we will focus on the effects of the protein force field and virtual sites below. Table 11 also includes one additional model which combines the new protein force field with the small molecule OPLS2.1 model (OPLS2.1+new_proteinFF) to delineate the statistical improvements due to the new protein force field and virtual sites individually for each series in the data set; it can be seen that both make notable contributions to reducing the errors, albeit with significant variation in impact depending upon which series is being studied.

We demonstrate the effects of the protein force field on ligand binding affinity prediction with a couple of examples. From Table 11, the RMSE over the BACE series improves from 1.03 kcal/mol with OPLS2.1 to 0.89 kcal/mol with OPLS3. As illustrated in Figure 4, the main driving force behind this improvement is better modeling of ligand perturbations that
specifically explore the S3 subpocket of the protein.54 The substitution position that probes this pocket (R1) is illustrated in the left panel of Figure 4. The plot in the middle gives the experimental and FEP-predicted binding affinity over a ligand subseries that solely varies R1. OPLS3 captures the trend well, whereas OPLS2.1 overestimates the favorability of larger R1 groups (methoxy, nitrile, methyl-alkyne) by 1−2 kcal/mol relative to their smaller counterparts (hydrogen and methyl). The reason for the overly favorable OPLS2.1 predictions is illustrated in the right panel. In OPLS2.1, the helix that partially encloses the S3 pocket preferentially adopts an alternate conformation translating the pocket occluding Ala396 residue leading to an overly permissible protein environment for the larger R1 substituents. A substantial improvement is also seen in CDK2, where the RMSE is 0.86 kcal/mol in OPLS3 and 1.27 kcal/mol in OPLS2.1. This level of improvement is also seen with the OPLS2.1+new_proteinFF model, which indicates that a significant portion of this gain in accuracy is attributable to improved modeling of the protein-binding site. More specifically, as illustrated in Figure 5, poor fidelity of the Asp86 rotamer states in OPLS2.1 looks to be the underlying cause of the discrepancy. The figure provides a histogram of the distance between the sulfonamide nitrogen of 1h1s and the carboxylate carbon of Asp86 derived from the simulations. Distances less than 4.5 Å indicate hydrogen bond forming configurations between the respective groups. In OPLS2.1, Asp86 preferentially adopts rotameric states that prevent sulfonamide−carboxylate hydrogen bonds which is inconsistent with the hydrogen bonding state indicated by the 1h1s X-ray structure. In contrast, a hydrogen bond is formed between these groups in approximately 80% of sampled OPLS3 configurations. The CDK2 series also contains two additional ligands that form similar hydrogen bonds to Asp86 (1oiy and 1oi9 shown in Figure 6). The relative predicted affinity between these three ligands with respect to the unsubstituted variant 1h1q is summarized in Table 12. On average, OPLS2.1 underestimates the affinity of these hydrogen-bond forming ligands by approximately 1 kcal/mol which is consistent with
the lack of hydrogen bonding observed in Figure 5. In contrast, the OPLS3 predicted relative binding affinities are consistent with experiment. We now turn to illustrative examples where the use of virtual sites provides major improvement in FEP predictions for specific ligand series. Without virtual sites, the JNK1 series in Table 11 gives a RMSE of 0.87 and 0.81 kcal/mol using the OPLS2.1 and OPLS2.1+new_proteinFF models, respectively. With the addition of virtual site based charges in OPLS3 the error improves to 0.62 kcal/mol. In part, this improvement is a consequence of improved treatment of halogen bonding effects with the virtual site based model. Halogen bonds consist of favorable interactions between Lewis bases and aryl halogens owing to a positive electrostatic potential that arises from a
depletion of electron density at the tip of the halide.63 As has
been discussed elsewhere,32,64−66 capturing this effect in a force field necessitates breaking charge symmetry inherent to atomcentered partial charge models which can be accomplished using virtual sites. Figure 7 provides an illustration contrasting
the modeling of a halogen bond between chlorobenzene and the carbonyl oxygen of N-methylacetamide. The atom centered OPLS2.1 models this interaction as unfavorable at all distances. In contrast OPLS3 models the interaction as favorable at a distance of approximately 3 Å, which is consistent with QM. As shown in Figure 7, ligands 6f and 6q consist of aryl halogen groups that can form halogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Met111. Table 13 gives the associated predicted binding affinity for both ligands. Consistent with the lack of halogen bonding in the model, OPLS2.1 underestimates the free energy of binding by 1.2 kcal/mol (averaged over the pair). In contrast, the binding affinity of the pair is predicted to

be more favorable by ∼0.8 kcal/mol, as well as more consistent with experiment using OPLS3. Figure 8 displays additional test series that were developed to specifically probe changes in protein−ligand affinity due solely to changes in the composition and position of heteroatoms in aromatic rings; this is the type of problem for which we expect the inclusion of virtual sites and to have the greatest impact. Table 14 summarizes the RMS error over the various examples. In total, the composite system includes 55 ligands, 62 FEP perturbations across 4 protein targets. The overall improvement in the error is significant (approximately 20%). The most significant improvement in this test set is seen in the FXA series where the RMSE drops from 2.05 kcal/mol in OPLS2.1 to 1.27 kcal/mol in OPLS3. The improvement in this series is driven by improved modeling of aryl nitrogen substitutions in the chloroheteroaryl ring of the series that
probe the S1 pocket of the binding site.73 As shown in Figure 9 and Table 15, placement of aryl nitrogens and their associated lone pairs (ligands 17i and 17h) in the electron rich receptor environment formed by the backbone carbonyl Gly219 and the
carboxylate of Asp18972 leads to a significant drop in affinity relative to the biaryl thiophene derivative (17d). Experimentally the drop in affinity is between 4 and 5 kcal/mol. In OPLS2.1 the drop is marginal by comparison (0.5−1 kcal/mol). The introduction of virtual sites in the representation of the thiazole derivatives more accurately captures the inhospitable nature of this regime of the binding site leading to a significant improvement in the binding affinity trend (drop in affinity of 2−4 kcal/mol).
V. DISCUSSION
As was discussed above in section II, the current state of the art in force field development entails the use of significant heuristic approximations (classical treatment of the nuclei, lack of explicit polarization and the associated models for the effective charge distribution, fitting to gas phase quantum chemical potential energy surfaces) as well as specific choices within these approximations (e.g., the precise level of quantum chemistry used to generate model torsional profiles). The central issue with regard to any such development protocol is the degree of transferability of the models, beyond explicit fitting to experiment. Fitting to experiment is at present necessary at various key points in the development process
(e.g., optimizing van der Waals parameters to fit liquid state thermodynamic data, modifying charge distributions to fit aqueous solvation free energies, adjusting torsional parameters to reflect experimental rotamer distributions in the protein force field). The question then becomes how well the overall process translates into predictive capability for experimental observables that are not directly fitted. For the protein force field, there are numerous benchmarks that have historically been used to calibrate performance in this regard. These include simulations assessing the stability of peptides and small proteins, calculations of observables in NMR experiments (NOEs and dipolar couplings), and computation of time scales for dynamical events (e.g., protein

folding, conformational changes, diffusion through ion channels). We have reported results for some of these standard benchmarks in section III.F above; we are currently performing simulations of NMR spectra, which will be discussed in a future publication. The protein−ligand binding affinity FEP results described in section IV constitute a sufficiently large and diverse data set to enable a rigorous assessment of the performance of both the protein and small molecule ligand force fields. As none of the parameters were adjusted to improve the prediction of binding affinities, the RMS errors obtained enable a fair evaluation of transferability and accuracy. Of equal importance is the fact that all of the simulations were run using an identical, fully automated sampling protocol. These aspects of the data generation protocol ensure that the comparisons of theory to experiment are completely unbiased and allow an objective comparison of the accuracy of the three force fields investigated (OPLS_2005, OPLS2.1, OPLS3). The first step in quantitatively analyzing the results is to consider the various sources of error, with respect to experiment, in computed free energies, i.e. what are the various contributions to the observed RMSE of the prediction method versus the experimental data. We enumerate these sources of error as follows: (1) Errors in the force field (2) Errors in the experimental measurements (3) Random errors in the precision of the sampling (defined further below) (4) Systematic errors in the sampling (i.e., failure to fully explore the phase space of the complex or the protein and ligand in solution). Components 1, 2, and 3 are straightforward. One can understand the precision of the sampling as the variance in the reported binding affinity one would typically obtain if a large number of simulations were performed using the standard protocol but with slight variations in the starting geometry or the initially assigned velocities. Errors (3) and (4) together constitute the total sampling error, but it is useful to separate precision and adequacy of phase space coverage as they would in many cases in practice be addressed by different approaches; longer sampling times in the first case, some sort of change in the sampling algorithm in the second (although simulating for an infinitely long time would solve both problems). Interestingly, the recently introduced cycle-closure method of estimating the sampling error can partially estimate the systematic sampling error, so long as all relevant states occur
in at least one perturbation of the closed cycle.74 We estimate the error in the experiments (averaged over many different data sets) as on the order of 0.5 kcal/mol RMS
error.75 The error in precision of the sampling and a partial estimate of the systematic error in the sampling can be estimated from a cycle closure analysis of the FEP data and is
here observed to be 0.66 kcal/mol.74 We further expect that the total observed error must grow as the quadrature of the individual sources of the error. Thus, the total observed error can be related to the individual sources of the error through the following equation
0.95 kcal/mol = sqrt([0.5 kcal/mol] + [0.66 kcal/mol] + X )
2 22
(2)
where 0.95 kcal/mol is the observed RMSE versus the experimental data of the OPLS3 force field in this work, and the remaining variable X can be interpreted to be the estimated
force field error observed in the large scale FEP binding affinity testing. This admittedly approximate analysis suggests the underlying accuracy of the OPLS3 force field to be ∼0.5 kcal/ mol or of comparable accuracy to the underlying experimental target affinity data. The preceding not withstanding, it is not possible to rigorously separate the force field and phase space sampling components of the error. Based on our experience investigating outliers in the FEP simulations up to this point, we estimate the RMS error in binding affinity predictions due to the force field to be in the range of 0.5−0.75 kcal/mol, roughly in agreement with the above first order analysis. This is a remarkably small value, particularly given the approximate treatment of polarization which some have believed to fundamentally limit force field accuracy to the point where it might not be useful for applications like a priori binding affinity prediction. Furthermore, our belief is that this error can and will be significantly reduced as we address other details of the force field model, such as improved protocols for assigning partial charges. It seems likely that the point can be reached where the RMS error in the simulation is comparable to the experimental RMS error (0.5 kcal/mol). At that point, higher precision experiments would be required to make progress in calibrating further improvements in the theoretical methodology. From the point of view of practical drug discovery projects, there is also the question of correlation between in vitro and in vivo inhibition; many factors other than in vitro potency affect activity in the cell (some of which are very difficult to model theoretically). It is important to point out that the binding of a small molecule to a protein is only one among many biophysically important events that one would like to predict using biomolecular simulation. This particular event benefits from cancellation of errors (between the ligand in solution and the ligand in the protein) for various types of interactions. For example, if a hydrogen bond strength between a ligand and protein group is overestimated, the error may in large part cancel if the corresponding hydrogen bonds between the ligand and water (and the protein and water) are proportionately overestimated. Furthermore, the ligand and protein have a small number of total interactions as compared to for example a typical protein−protein interface or the self-interactions of a folded protein; in the latter, a large number of small errors may add up to produce nonphysical behavior in binding or folding. Hence, the conclusions presented here with regard to the observed errors do not guarantee that other quantities of interest can be computed to a similar precision. From this more general perspective on biomolecular simulation, perhaps the greatest reason for optimism is the observation that the RMS errors are systematically reduced as the force field quality is improved. Table 11 reports the estimated RMS error due to the force field for OPLS_2005, OPLS2.1, and OPLS3. The improvement across this series is 30%, which is well above the level of noise in the calculations. Furthermore, the reduction in error was achieved without any empirical fitting to protein−ligand binding data. Ultimately force field improvement will include technically difficult features such as explicit polarization, and this should continue the trend in Table 11 further; and it may well be that explicit polarization has a greater qualitative impact on important properties such as relative protein conformational energetics (for example in comparing folded and unfolded states) than it apparently does on protein−ligand binding. However, the

results presented herein also set a bar for the performance that should be expected of a polarizable force field that represents an actual improvement over the state of the art fixed charge models. It is not enough to simply include polarization explicitly; the functional form of the remainder of the force field, parametrization of the entire model, and the sampling protocols have to be good enough to enable the benefits of the augmented physical representation to be realized. A demonstration that this is the case in turn requires presenting results for large data sets; a few anecdotal cases cannot be used to draw conclusions about accuracy or robustness. We provide force field parameters for the OPLS3 protein force field and for all molecules relevant to FEP calculations, in the Supporting Information. These data sets should enable benchmarking of alternative force fields, FEP protocols, and other types of binding affinity calculations. The OPLS3 force field, DESMOND molecular dynamics simulation package, and FEP+ module are available from Schrodinger, Inc.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have shown that the OPLS3 force field delivers state of the art performance in protein simulations and that it is capable of predicting protein−ligand binding affinities to high accuracy over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error). We have also demonstrated that the accuracy of protein−ligand binding affinity can be systematically improved by improving the force field. This data is highly encouraging with regard to the ability of computational methodology to directly impact drug discovery via high accuracy binding affinity prediction. Many such applications are currently in progress in a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as via Schrodinger collaborations with various experimental groups. The impact of the methodology on projects remains to be established, but the initial results in this regard are encouraging. In the immediate future, our intention is to carefully investigate the relatively small number of outliers that we have observed in our binding affinity predictions and from this deduce the most important improvements that need to be made in both the force field and the FEP sampling protocols. In parallel, we will continue to work on the protein force field, for example by comparing simulation results with NMR spectra. The combination of systematic force field improvement, better sampling algorithms, and more efficient hardware (via Moore’s law) will continue to increase the utility of computational methods in a wide range of biomolecular simulation applications. In the long run, as such calculations become less expensive, more convenient, and more reliable, theory will evolve toward a full partnership with experiment, to the benefit of both approaches.
