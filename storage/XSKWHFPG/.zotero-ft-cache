Conspectus
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials with well-defined cavities and pores, which can
be prepared under different pore topologies and chemical compositions. Their preparation is
typically defined by multiple interconnected variables (e.g. reagent sources, molar ratios, ageing
treatments, reaction time and temperature, among others), but unfortunately their distinctive
influence, particularly on the nucleation and crystallization processes, is still far from being
understood. Thus, the discovery and/or optimization of specific zeolites is closely related to the
exploration of the parametric space through trial-and-error methods, generally by studying the
influence of each parameter individually.
In the last decade, machine learning (ML) methods have rapidly evolved to address complex
problems involving highly non-linear or massively combinatorial processes that conventional
approaches cannot solve. Considering the vast and interconnected multiparametric space in
zeolite synthesis, coupled with our poor understanding of the mechanisms involved in their
nucleation and crystallization, the use of ML is especially timely for improving zeolite synthesis.
Indeed, the complex space of zeolite synthesis requires drawing inferences from incomplete and
imperfect information, for which ML methods are very well-suited to replace the intuition-based
approaches traditionally used to guide experimentation.
In this Account, we contend that both existing and new ML approaches can provide the “missing
link” needed to complete the traditional zeolite synthesis workflow used in our quest to
rationalize zeolite synthesis. Within this context, we have made important efforts on developing
ML tools in different critical areas, such as 1) data-mining tools to process the large amount of
data generated using high-throughput platforms; 2) novel complex algorithms to predict the
formation of energetically-stable hypothetical zeolites and guide the synthesis of new zeolite
structures; 3) new “ab-initio” OSDA predictions to direct the synthesis of hypothetical or known
zeolites; 4) an automated tool for non-supervised data extraction and classification from
published research articles.
ML has already revolutionized many areas in materials science by enhancing our ability to map
intricate behavior to process variables, especially in the absence of well-understood
mechanisms. Undoubtedly, ML is a burgeoning field with many future opportunities for further
breakthroughs to advance the design of molecular sieves. For this reason, this Account includes
an outlook of future research directions based on current challenges and opportunities. We
envision this Account will become a hallmark reference for both well-established and new
researchers in the field of zeolite synthesis.

1.- Introduction
Designing crystalline materials with tailored physicochemical properties is critical to industries
spanning chemicals and petroleum to pharmaceuticals and electronics. Zeolites are crystalline,
microporous aluminosilicates with well-defined cavities and pore topologies of molecular
dimensions that directly impact the global economy with their ubiquitous use in many large
scale catalytic and absorption processes. Few crystalline materials exhibit the level of synthetic
complexity encountered in the preparation of zeolites, where multiple parameters (i.e. reagent
sources, molar ratios, ageing treatments, reaction time and temperature, among many others)
can be used to alter the outcome.1 The objective of selecting the appropriate synthesis
conditions is to arrive at a crystal structure that has the desired physicochemical properties, but
this point is very difficult because zeolite crystallization is not well understood. Zeolite
crystallization is an interfacial phenomenon where the nucleation and crystallization of solute
molecules is mediated by interactions with structure directing agents (SDAs), mainly organic and
inorganic cations, that vary both in size and composition. In general, zeolites require the use of
organic SDAs (OSDAs), which typically are amines and ammonium cations, featuring sizes and
shapes commensurate with the geometry of porous channels/cages, to direct pore formation.2
3 Preferentially, these OSDAs are amines, ammonium However, today, most zeolite discovery
efforts continue to be based on trial-and-error approaches with minimal control over the
resulting structures.1-2
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with increased accessibility to large data
sets has allowed the development of new algorithms and statistical methods capable of
extracting relationships between variables in multidimensional systems.4 In particular, the use
of machine learning (ML)—a subfield of AI that relies on complex mathematical models that can
effectively “learn” from past data to find complex patterns embedded within large data sets
in materials science has revolutionized our ability to map intricate behavior to process variables,
especially in the absence of well-understood mechanisms. Considering the vast and
interconnected multiparametric space in zeolite synthesis, our poor understanding of the
control of mechanisms involved in their nucleation/crystallization, and the large amount of
empirical data existing in the field, the use of ML is especially timely for improving zeolite
synthesis. We expect these advances will have a dramatic impact on predicting hypothetical and
known zeolites, as well as their synthesis conditions, undoubtedly accelerating the discovery of
target microporous materials and ultimately improving our fundamental understanding.


5
To accomplish this goal, we must incorporate both existing and new ML approaches within the
“traditional” zeolite synthesis workflow featuring well-established high-throughput
synthesis/characterization devices and data-mining software (see Figure 1). We contend that
ML will have a pivotal role in extracting, classifying, and interconnecting information across four
critical research areas, namely i) high-throughput synthesis efforts, ii) design of feasible
hypothetical zeolites, iii) “In-silico” prediction of OSDAs for target zeolites, and iv) automated,
non-supervised data extraction from published literature. We note that most ML algorithms
require “learning” from existing data sets to improve their accuracy, thus requiring effective
methods to generate, organize, extract, and utilize existing and new information from
computational and experimental outputs.
In this account, we present, within the context of concurrent efforts by many other research
groups, the main tools developed by our group at the ITQ that have helped advance each of the
above-mentioned research areas. First, we describe data-mining tools developed to process the
large amount of data generated at the advent of high-throughput infrastructure. Next, we
describe the development of complex algorithms to predict the formation of energetically
stable hypothetical zeolites, the “ab-initio” OSDA predictions to direct the synthesis of
hypothetical or known zeolites, and, finally, the non-supervised data extraction and
classification from literature. We conclude with an outlook of future research directions based
on current challenges and opportunities.
2.- “High-Throughput” platforms for zeolite synthesis
In the late 1990’s, the empirical data acquisition process for zeolite synthesis was greatly
accelerated with the implementation of “high-throughput” (HT) synthesis methods.5-7 These HT
systems featured robotic multireactor systems operating under the tenets of automation,
parallelization, and miniaturization that could explore many synthetic parameters automatically
with drastic reductions in cost and time.8 Unlike those used in the pharmaceutical industry, HT
reactors for zeolite synthesis needed to be re-engineered to i) handle harsher temperature
(∼150-200°C), pressure (∼1.5 MPa) and alkaline conditions, ii) dispense both liquid and solids of
varying physicochemical properties, and iii) be compatible with automated and parallelized
characterization techniques using microgram scale solids. The use of these HT devices fast
tracked the discovery of some novel zeolitic materials.9-10 The fast rates and large amounts of
data generated in these systems required the development of “data-mining” methods for rapid
and unsupervised analyses (see Figure 1).11


6
2.1.- High-Throughput synthesis
The first multiautoclave designs consisted of a metal block containing Teflon-lined cylindrical
chambers presenting diverse volumes, mostly between ∼0.5-1 ml (see Figure 2A).6-7, 12-13 We
developed a multiautoclave for an in-house HT robotic system (see Figure 2B), based on 15
individual portable Teflon vessels with intermediate volumes of ∼1-2 ml.14 This feature was an
important breakthrough in the design of multiautoclaves for zeolites because it allowed precise
weight control during the entire gel preparation process. Modern multiautoclave designs also
permit the in-situ filtration of the gels by connecting the vessels to a sealed, vacuum-pumped
chamber.15-16
In general, the manufacture of fully automated devices for HT zeolite synthesis is restricted to
large HT technology producers (e.g., Unchained Labs, Avantium, HTE, Bosch, Chemspeed and
Zinsser), who can integrate robotics, engineering, and data-management into customer-tailored
commercial instruments. Unlike simpler multiautoclave reactors, these highly-modular systems
integrate liquid/powder dosing, stirring/mixing, milling/grinding, pH control, heating/cooling,
among other requirements that can be included depending on the customer necessities. Several
years ago, we developed an in-house automated system for zeolite synthesis at the ITQ (see
Figure 2B), composed of a robotic arm that handled the vials, a liquid/solid dosing station, and
a stirring/evaporation station.14 Seven calibrated syringe pumps allowed precise liquid dosing,
while the accurate control of the liquid/solid additions and liquid evaporations were
accomplished through analytical balance measurements.
2.2.- High-Throughput characterization
HT zeolite synthesis requires concomitant topological, textural, and/or chemical analysis to be
performed at commensurate timescales to avoiding workflow bottlenecks. Powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) is the most common technique to identify crystalline microporous structures.
Commercial vendors tackled automated collection of multiple PXRD patterns from large sample
libraries by incorporating flat stages that could be moved in all directions (XYZ-stages, see Figure
2C). Gas sorption to probe zeolite porosity also required unique adaptation for HT analysis
because these measurements may last several hours. In order to circumvent this bottleneck, a
system for screening the porosity of large number of microporous materials was developed
using the heat generated during gas adsorption for quantification.17 Other characterization
techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF),18 IR spectroscopy combined with the
adsorption/desorption of probe molecules,19 and temperature programmed desorption (TPD),20
have also been adapted for HT systems.


7
2.3.- Data-Mining Techniques
The development of the first automated HT zeolite synthesis systems drastically increased the
number of experiments that could be performed in parallel and, consequently, increased the
number of variables that could be explored simultaneously (see Figure 3).6, 13-14 Accordingly,
data-mining techniques begun their development almost simultaneously with HT synthesis as a
means to aid in the exploration of broad synthesis spaces through careful design of experiments
(DoE) and to analyze the large quantities of data generated by these experiments (see Figure 1).
2.4.1.- Design of Experiments (DoE)
In HT zeolite synthesis, selecting which variables to investigate during the initial DoE is a very
challenging task because the effects that individual variables have on nucleation/crystallization
mechanisms are highly intercorrelated. The first DoE for early HT zeolite synthesis campaigns
were based almost exclusively on classic exploratory factorial designs.6, 13-14 These designs
involve generating possible combinations of two or more variables, which presenting different
levels or values. Full factorial designs allowed to exploring the effect of each synthesis variable
on zeolite crystallization, as well as the influence of interconnected variables (see Figure 3A).6
We systematically studied the system TEA:SiO2:Na2O:Al2O3:H2O by HT methods, where TEA is
tetraethylammonium, in order to synthesize the Beta zeolite with high yields while using a low
OSDA content in the synthesis gel.14 Following a full-factorial design (see Figure 3B), a high-silica
Beta with low OSDA contents (TEA/Si∼0.27) and excellent crystallinity was obtained when using
concentrated synthesis gels (e.g., H2O/Si∼5). The factorial design approach has also yielded new
zeolite structures. For instance, researchers at UOP systematically explored simple mixtures of
tetramethyl and tetraethylammonium OSDAs, ultimately discovering conditions that crystallized
UZM-4 (12x8-rings) and UZM-5 (8x8-rings).9
In this respect, our group initiated some of the first efforts to incorporate simple statistics to
properly evaluate the impact of the different synthesis variables during HT synthesis processes.
Our objective was to direct the synthesis conditions more effectively in the second generation
of experiments.
The discovery of ITQ-33 started by performing a very large initial factorial design (3×43) to
explore unusual synthesis conditions using flexible OSDA molecules (e.g. hexamethonium).10, 21
The initial proposed conditions totaled 192 experiments, spanning the following precursor
ranges: Si/Ge∼2-30, B/(Si+Ge)∼0-0.05, OH/(Si+Ge)∼0.1-0.5, H2O/(Si+Ge)∼5-30. This campaign


8
resulted in some phase-pure zeolites and several multi-phase mixtures, one of which contained
an unknown phase that was named ITQ-33. The results were subjected to Pareto analysis in
order to plan a second generation of experiments aimed at isolating ITQ-33.21 The Pareto
analysis showed that ITQ-33 was most influenced by Si/Ge and OH/(Si+Ge) (see Figure 3C). In
light of these findings, a second set of 18 experiments was proposed that yielded phase-pure
ITQ-33—a unique extra-large pore zeolite interconnected bidirectionally with 10-ring channels
exhibiting remarkable selectivity to diesel and propylene in the cracking of vacuum gasoil.10, 21
In a similar way, the discovery of ITQ-30—a zeolite with excellent catalytic performance for the
alkylation of benzene with propylene to produce cumene—involved studying the directing role
of the rigid and bulky N-methyl-sparteinium OSDA across 144 experiments spanning a broad
range of synthesis conditions.22 These experiments generated ITQ-21 (a large-pore zeolite) and
an unknown phase named ITQ-30. Further statistical analysis revealed that the crystallization of
ITQ-30 was negatively influenced by increasing water and Al contents, regardless the Si/Ge ratio
(see Figure 3D). Accordingly, the next generation of experiments afforded the crystallization
phase-pure ITQ-30 zeolite under Ge-free conditions.22
Advanced methods, including artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs),
are necessary for cases in which simple statistics cannot effectively guide experimental design.14,
23 ANNs are non-linear systems that can model complex multidimensional studies through nodes
with connections reminiscent of those found in a biological brain (see Figure 4A). GAs operate
with similar mechanisms to those behind Darwinian evolution, where the best variables
dominate the next generation population by selecting the proper operators (e.g., selection,
crossover, and mutation). As a standout example, we combined ANNs and GAs to improve the
catalytic behavior of Ti-silicates for the selective epoxidation of olefins.23 Specifically, we used
ANNs to predict the internal relationships between different synthesis variables after being
properly trained with previous data, and then used GAs to optimize the next generation of
material synthesis experiments considering the knowledge extracted by the ANN. Different
synthesis variables were considered (e.g. surfactant, organic modifier, OH or titanium contents).
Three generations of 38 samples were synthesized using the NN-GA optimization process,
achieving an outstanding improvement of both catalytic activity and epoxide selectivity each
generation (see Figure 4B). The improved catalytic behavior was found when decreasing the
amount of the organic modifier while keeping the OH/Si molar ratio at ∼0.2.23
2.4.2.- Data extraction and classification


9
Data extraction and classification from HT experiments can become a major bottleneck if not
managed properly. For this reason, significant efforts have been dedicated to develop non
supervised data analysis tools with the aim of generating new Data-Mining mapping/exploration
methods that allow facile and rapid data extraction and visualization.
Clustering using k-means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Clustering analyses of raw PXRD data permits non-supervised classification of crystalline
materials into diverse groups based on similarities in the diffraction patterns. This technique is
particularly useful for discriminating and identifying pure-phases in mixed systems. By
considering the PXRD patterns as structural vectors, the classification or clustering of the
achieved solids can be carried out by applying statistical tools, such as k-means clustering and
PCA.
The k-means clustering algorithm assigns n samples into k clusters with the nearest mean (a
value which is updated every time a new component is added to the cluster) and this process is
repeated until all components are classified into different clusters. We utilized the k-means
clustering algorithm for classifying HT synthesis raw data, by selecting all the PXRD patterns
obtained from the 144 syntheses carried out during the ITQ-21/ITQ-30 synthesis campaign
described in the previous section (see Figure 5A).11 The k-clustering analysis binned the raw
PXRD data results into three well-defined clusters: amorphous (cluster 1), ITQ-21 (cluster 2),
and ITQ-30 (cluster 3) (see Figure 5B). Interestingly, the overall match between real phases and
the proposed clusters following the k-means analysis was ∼90%, demonstrating the high
potential of this tool.
The PCA uses statistical methods to reduce the information contained within a long descriptor
(e.g., an individual PXRD pattern containing all the diffraction intensities), into three structural
principal components (SPCs) while conserving all the information of the original data. We
applied the PCA analyses to the data from the same ITQ-21/ITQ-30 synthesis campaign,11
achieving a dimensional reduction to just three components for each PXRD pattern, ultimately
providing a very simple 3D cluster visualization (see Figure 5C) that allowed us to correlate the
SPC projections with the crystallinity and chemical composition of each synthesized material.
Adaptable Time Warping (ATW) models
Our group has developed protocols to extract and predict structural parameters of synthesized
materials in order to classify and relate structural features to synthesis variables.24-25 For


10
example, a common issue in the analysis of diffraction data is that the PXRD pattern of a specific
crystalline structure can present large differences, both in peak intensity and 2θ shifts,
depending on its crystal size or chemical composition. This complicates non-supervised
structural recognition, particularly when mixed phases are present. Our ATM algorithm allows
searching distances to detect 2θ shifts between the input and the reference pattern instead of
comparing the value of the input pattern at a specific 2θ angle with a reference at the same 2θ
angle (see Figure 6A).24-25 The method was successfully validated when the diffraction patterns
for eight different crystalline zeolites were correctly identified with a classification error of <3%
from the complex diffractogram of the mixed solids (see Figure 6B).24-25
3.- Computational methods and machine learning techniques for zeolite synthesis
Modern zeolite synthesis requires close integration between experiments and computation to
gain insight into the fundamental underpinnings linking structure and property to the synthesis
recipe. Computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulations, electronic structure
calculations using first principles, Monte Carlo techniques, and continuum macroscopic
approaches, have been developed hand-in-hand with experimental methodologies to
understand the assembly of microporous materials.26 Theoretical simulations can in principle
require less time compared to experimental measurements, thereby accelerating the discovery
of new materials, reducing both time and cost expenditures. However, unlike well-established
HT experimental protocols, most computational techniques used to date cannot be
implemented in a HT manner without jeopardizing accuracy given the need to use expensive
high-level quantum chemistry methods to correctly calculate the complex energy landscape of
hydrothermal crystallization processes. In this respect, the use of ML algorithms offers an
attractive avenue to accelerate the discovery and optimization of molecular sieve synthesis by
bypassing the need for resource-intensive simulations and instead use learned patterns from
training examples to estimate properties or predict outcomes under unexplored conditions. In
the next section we present some of our efforts towards the development of computational
tools for enabling the use of ML for zeolite synthesis.
3.1.- Hypothetical structures and phase identification
To date, approximately 240 distinct zeolite structures have been successfully synthesized, which
is in stark contrast to the millions of hypothetical structures generated using mathematical
constructs. Hypothetical zeolites have been generated using symmetry-constrained geometric
linkage of subunits, tiling theory, and genetic algorithms coupled with bonding rules and lattice
energy minimization programs to down select chemically-feasible structures.27-28 Deem and co


11
workers who used Monte Carlo simulations coupled with interatomic potential refinement to
investigate the arrangement of Si atom positions, unit cells, space groups, and framework
densities in porous materials, generating over 2.6 M predicted zeolite-like materials.29 Since
then, the chemical feasibility of these hypothetically structures has been evaluated by various
groups using more complex methods, including local interatomic distances (LIDs), TTT angles,
minimum 5-th neighbor distance, average tetrahedral order parameter, and pore dimensionality
to further refine the subgroup of synthetically accessible materials.30-31
Evidently, these hypothetical structures can be used to identify new zeolites synthesized in the
laboratory. For instance, when we obtained the structure of ITQ-51 (see Figure 7A), an extra
large pore zeolite with 16-rings synthesized using bulky proton sponges as OSDAs, we realized
that the structure was included in Deem’s database as a pure-silica analog.32 This encouraged us
to explore analogous structures, an exercise that revealed extensive similarities between ITQ
51 and AlPO-31. Using this information, we surmised that if the 4-rings forming the 12-ring
channel in AlPO-31 were substituted by six helical 4-ring chains, a hypothetical 18-ring zeolite
(denoted as T18MR, see Figure 7B) would be formed.32 This approach was extended to generate
three additional hypothetical large-pore structures that are currently important synthetic
targets in our laboratory.
Hypothetical zeolite construction is also a powerful tool when used to narrow down the
structural space for unknown, highly-complex crystals for which limited available
characterization data is available. ITQ-43 is a hierarchical zeolite featuring a very open structure
(11.4 T-atoms/1000 Å3) and cloverleaf-like channels formed by 28-rings (see Figure 7C).33 When
we first synthesized ITQ-43, we knew from PXRD data that the crystal structure was built either
by C222, Cmm2, Cm2m, C2mm, or Cmmm space groups. However, due to its large cell
parameters and low stability in its calcined form, we could not extract reliable structural
information from either diffraction or HR-TEM data. With limited characterization data, we
relied on an in-house simulation program to generate a feasible set of potential structural
candidates.33-34 More specifically, we developed an evolutionary algorithm deployed using GPU
hardware that independently manipulated fixed arrays of variables corresponding to atoms
coordinates belonging to the asymmetric unit cell. By using suitable fitness evaluation and
optimization criteria we generated the 50 most-viable structures. The resolved crystal structure
of ITQ-43 was shown to be one of these predicted structures, thereby demonstrating the
usefulness of hypothetical structures generated through experimentally-imposed constrains.


12
In a very elegant attempt to predict the synthesis of hypothetical zeolites, Yu et al. have
described a multidatabase, Zeobank, containing synthesis conditions, known structures, and
hypothetical structures to perform computational-guided studies between synthetic
parameters and zeolite structures.35-37 Different data-mining techniques, as support vector
machines (SVM) and neural networks (NN), were investigated for correlating experimental
conditions and crystalline products.
3.2.- OSDA-zeolite prediction
For zeolites, we now understand that coupled thermodynamic and kinetic factors, mainly in the
form weak van der Waals interactions between OSDAs and inorganic moieties that influence
nucleation events, are responsible for determining the synthesis product. Accurately capturing
the fine interplay between organic and inorganic species at the molecular level necessitates the
development of the appropriate computational tools.
Inspired by the work of Catlow et. al.,38 we used Monte Carlo and energy minimization molecular
dynamics simulations to rationalize the effect of OSDA stabilization on the zeolite structure.39-40
Specifically, by explicitly including the OSDA-OSDA and OSDA-zeolite interactions in the potential
energy function, we established a simple, yet powerful framework to approximate the energy
change of the system upon OSDA incorporation. This approach allowed us to isolate one product
out of two closely related zeolite structures, namely ITQ-7 and ITQ-17, by identifying an optimal
OSDA out of several structurally-similar azocompounds.39 We used similar molecular simulations
to predicted an optimal OSDA to synthesize phase pure Ti-containing BEC.40 Notably, the
generality of the approach was demonstrated when a commercial tert-butyl
iminotris(dimethylamino)phosphorane OSDA was identified amongst multiple phosphazenes to
stabilize the structure of the elusive boggsite zeolite, enabling, for the first time, the synthesis
of a molecular sieve that had only been obtained as a naturally-occurring mineral.41
These results suggest that these computational methods allow the a priori prediction of an OSDA
molecule to synthesize a desired framework. However, a major shortcoming of this approach is
that molecules used in the calculation could be difficult to synthesize. A computational method
to predict chemically synthesizable OSDAs for crystalline molecular sieves was reported by
Deem, wherein transformations from organic chemistry were applied to a library of available
reagents to generate molecules that were scored based on rigidity, volume, stability under
synthesis conditions, and energy of interaction with the zeolite.42 Davis et. al. validated the


13
method experimentally by successfully synthesizing the SFW zeolite,43 and the enantioenriched
polycrystalline STW zeolite (see Figure 8).44-45
The time requirement to perform accurate molecular dynamics simulations is inextricably
correlated with computing power and availability. For example, when predicting the suitability
of a molecule to serve as an OSDA for a target zeolite, calculating the stabilization energy within
the framework is one of the most intensive computational steps, requiring several hours of CPU
time. Comparatively, trained ML algorithms are inherently more efficient and less
computationally-intensive, making them ideally suited to replace computationally expensive
molecular dynamics evaluations of the stabilization energy of the OSDA inside zeolites. Deem
et. al. used a data set of 4781 OSDA stabilization energies previously computed for BEA zeolite
to train a NN on the molecular structure descriptors of OSDAs to forecast their stabilization
energies.46 Notably, the trained network was able to predict stabilization energies for new
putative molecules with comparable accuracy to that obtained with molecular dynamics
simulations, generating a list of new, chemically-synthesizable molecules that could be used to
crystallize the elusive polymorph A of BEA.
This approach could be applied to an even more ambitious goal: the synthesis of custom
designed zeolites that are tailored for specific applications. We recently demonstrated a new
concept in which a zeolite is prepared using OSDAs that mimic the transition state (TS) of
preestablished reactions, resulting in drastically enhanced reaction rates and selectivities.47-49
The idea of imprinting a TS within a rigid crystalline structure represents a disruptive departure
from traditional catalysis and provides exciting opportunities for designing more selective,
active, and responsive solids that can be further extended with the help of ML.
3.3.- Literature Data extraction
The full-scale implementation of ML techniques for zeolite synthesis is hindered by the
challenges associated with data sparsity and scarcity. Indeed, open-access datasets and
synthesis protocols for zeolites are smaller and more diverse compared to other efforts like the
Materials Genome Initiative. Low availability of materials data causes underfitting and large
prediction bias in ML models,50 and these shortcomings can be further exacerbated if negative
examples are not included. In this respect, the prolific peer-reviewed manuscript and patent
literature for zeolite synthesis offers a vast amount of data collected over a span of six decades.
However, collecting the relevant data from tables, figures, and experimental sections of
thousands of documents is an impossible task without automation. Leveraging recent advances


14
in natural language processing and text markup parsing tools, we recently developed a tool in
collaboration with Olivetti and co-workers to automatically extract synthesis information and
trends from zeolite journal articles (see Figure 9).51 Specifically, our pipeline automatically
located, extracted, and organized zeolite synthesis data from both the tables and main text of
thousands of articles. We validated the accuracy of the extracted data using a subset of articles
related to the preparation of germanium-containing zeolites for which the pipeline accurately
identified the complex relationships between the synthesis parameters and resulting topology.
We envision that with future improvements and small changes in data engineering, this tool can
be used to solve several other research questions in zeolite synthesis chemistry.
4.- Frontiers of ML for zeolite synthesis
The main challenge in zeolite synthesis is the incomplete understanding of the molecular-level
interactions and the kinetic and thermodynamic driving forces that govern the adsorption and
binding specificity of OSDAs to precursors leading to specific nucleation/crystallization events.
A fundamental understanding of these processes and the ability to a priori control crystallization
requires synergistic research efforts to probe atomic to macroscopic length scales. The complex
and multidimensional space of zeolite synthesis requires drawing inferences from incomplete
and imperfect information, for which ML methods are very well-suited to replace the intuition
based, trial-and-error approaches traditionally used to guide experimentation.
We showed how databases of hypothetical zeolites can play an important role in zeolite
discovery. However, the standard representation of crystal structures has been optimized for
human learning, which might not necessarily be optimal for ML. We need to develop improved
descriptors that can capture the properties we intend to model in more effective ways. Thus,
developing “ML-friendly” representations of crystal structures that are easily transferable across
methods is essential for reaching the level of predictive sophistication we have acquired in
molecular systems. In organic synthesis, NN have been used to create fingerprints or molecular
fragments for molecules in reactions, leading to improved prediction capabilities.52 The field of
zeolite crystallization could benefit tremendously from developing new approaches to define
more efficient nomenclature and structural representations.
Undoubtedly, new ML approaches will play an important role for enabling the computer
assisted synthesis of organic molecules that could replace expensive OSDAs for known zeolites
or predict the structure of molecules leading to new topologies. Recent work showing the use
of ML to predict the stabilization energies of chemically-synthesizable OSDAs with an accuracy


15
commensurate to that of high-level molecular dynamic simulations is a true testament of the
versatility of these algorithms. Future directions should leverage current efforts in ML-based
automated organic molecule retrosynthesis,53 including the unsupervised selection of reaction
conditions,54 catalysts, and reagents, to deploy AI-driven experimental platforms including full
automation for highly parallelized OSDA synthesis. OSDA design could benefit from cutting-edge
algorithms, such as generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning already used in
the design of biological compounds, in which new molecules with specific physicochemical
features are produced using a punishment/reward system analogous to that in psychological
conditioning.55 Further, given the limited amount of data compared to other fields, ML tools
applied to zeolite synthesis will benefit from cutting-edge approaches in meta-learning,
including neural Turing machines,56 and imitation learning.57
Naturally, the efficacy of ML schemes hinges on both the quality and amount of data used to
train the algorithms. We showed the tremendous advantages of natural language parsing tools
capable of accessing the vast amount of experimental data published in patents and journal
articles in an automated fashion. Future efforts should focus on developing improved ML and
visual recognition AI algorithms used in face-recognition and self-driving vehicles to extract and
classify data from figures (including diffractograms and spectrograms) in addition to written
records, journal articles, patents, laboratory notebooks, and internal databases. In many cases,
however, data is collected and stored in many disjoint formats without having validation or
standardized metadata. It is essential, that we, as a community, create and adopt robust
standardization protocols to make data/metadata accessible in a computer-readable form akin
to those implemented in parallel fields, while also allowing for easily implementing changes as
the data are updated or corrected.58
The growth of ML tools used for zeolite design is exciting, but they cannot be used yet as a
“silver-bullet” for solving all open questions in the field. It is imperative we understand the
limitations of ML tools so that we can help them learn properly. We should keep in mind that
predictive models developed by ML tools might not be interpretable to humans, given that the
way ML models represent knowledge rarely mirrors that used by scientists. Therefore, as we
embrace the ML-based design, we have to continue working on representing data in a manner
that maximizes the amount that humans and machines learn from each other.
