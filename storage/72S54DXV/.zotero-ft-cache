ABSTRACT The distributions of different cations around A-RNA are computed by Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation and replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD). Both the nonlinear PB and size-modified PB theories are considered. The number of ions bound to A-RNA, which can be measured experimentally, is well reproduced in all methods. On the other hand, the radial ion distribution profiles show differences between MD and PB. We showed that PB results are sensitive to ion size and functional form of the solvent dielectric region but not the solvent dielectric boundary definition. Size-modified PB agrees with replica exchange molecular dynamics much better than nonlinear PB when the ion sizes are chosen from atomistic simulations. The distribution of ions 14  ̊A away from the RNA central axis are reasonably well reproduced by size-modified PB for all ion types with a uniform solvent dielectric model and a sharp dielectric boundary between solvent and RNA. However, this model does not agree with MD for shorter distances from the A-RNA. A distance-dependent solvent dielectric function proposed by another research group improves the agreement for sodium and strontium ions, even for shorter distances from the A-RNA. However, Mg2þ distributions are still at significant variances for shorter distances.
INTRODUCTION
RNA molecules perform numerous functions in cells. These functions include transmission and storage of genetic information, biochemical synthesis, and more. Their functional diversity made the RNA molecules prime candidates to be the first living molecules (1). It is no wonder that RNA molecules attracted considerable experimental and computational interest. From the perspective of molecular biophysics, these macromolecules are particularly intriguing. They carry one negative charge per phosphate and nucleotide group. As polynucleotides, they accumulate a large negative charge that is balanced by mobile counterions in ionic solution. This cloud of counterions is an integral part of the RNA molecules in vivo and vitro, and is essential for RNA folding and function. In this article, we investigate computationally the ionic cloud surrounding one of the simplest (and most abundant) structures of RNA, the A-form duplex. Our understanding of linear polyelectrolytes and their interactions with counterions was advanced considerably by counterion condensation theory (2–4). In this theory, the polyelectrolyte is modeled as an infinite straight wire (or a smooth cylinder) with a uniform charge density. The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation is solved to determine the properties of the ion distributions around the charged wire and these distributions were used to compute experi
mental observables. Interestingly, this simple cylinder model illustrates the intriguing phenomenon of counterion condensation. In the simplest terms, counterion condensation means that a minimal number of counterions stick (or condense) near the polyelectrolyte rod independent of the bulk salt concentration. In this article, we compare ionic clouds computed with different computational methods. Alternative computational models can be tested by comparison to experimental data. The measurement should be sensitive enough to differentiate between different models and invalidate incorrect theories. An alternative is to compare the theory to all-atom simulations. The advantages of all-atom simulations are that the exact mathematical conditions are known, making it easier to evaluate the approximations of the theory against a detailed solution of a mathematically well-defined problem. The disadvantages of the simulations are that they are 1), based on a model and 2), approximate. In addition to being approximate, they usually cannot take into account experimental variables over a broad range of ionic solution conditions due to computational cost. A recent experimental observable that we consider in this article is the number of counterions (NCI) bound to the A-RNA (5,6). NCI is obtained computationally by integrating the local concentration over an influence volume around the A-RNA (a radius of ~20–30A ̊ from the central axis of the A-RNA) that includes counterions diffusively or tightly bound to the polyelectrolyte. The volume is proportional to r2 (r is the distance from the RNA center), making the short distance contribution to NCI less significant. A theory that accounts for short-length scales approximately while accurately reproducing properties that depend on large distances is accurate for volume-averaged

observables. Indeed, we demonstrate here that even a lowlevel PB calculation provides good predictions for the NCI. A potentially more sensitive measure is the binding pattern of counterions near the RNA surface. Crystallographic studies of RNA show tightly bound magnesium ions (7). These tightly bound ions influence RNA folding (8,9) and function (10). Therefore, approaches that are able to accurately predict ion distributions at short-distance from the RNA are also of considerable interest. In this article, we illustrate significant variances between theories for tight binding of magnesium. One possible approach to go beyond the simplest cylindrically symmetric PB model is to introduce the explicit structure of the RNA while using the same level of theory (Poisson-Boltzmann equation) for counterions, coions, and water molecules. The change with respect to the cylinder model is that the RNA specifies the boundary conditions at the dielectric boundary and the detailed three-dimensional charge distribution is taken into account. Hence, the molecular surface and the charge distribution of the biopolyelectrolyte are more realistic. Advances in algorithmic developments in the early 1990s led to three-dimensional nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann solvers. These solvers account for the realistic three-dimensional structure and shape of the polynucleotides and dielectric discontinuity effects. Sharp and Honig (11,12) pioneered numerical solutions of nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (NLPB) equations for biological macromolecules. New algorithms have been developed (13–16) that increase accuracy and efficiency of the original approach. In addition to the presumably better description of the ionic cloud, suggestive metal binding sites at the RNA surface have been proposed in many studies. Regions of high charge density near RNA and DNA computed with NLPB solvers were correlated with experimental observations, such as binding sites observed in crystallographic x-ray studies (17–19). More recently, the numerical formulation of PB has been modified to account for ion exclusion effects using a more physically sound lattice gas model (20). We consider this approach and variations in considerable detail in this article. Interestingly, the size-modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation and NLPB with a Stern layer (21,22) provides the same predictions of the average number of ions bound to biopolyelectrolytes as we see in cylindrical PB. However, as we illustrate in this article the same is not true for ion distribution profiles around nucleic acids. In another twist, one would expect that a physics-based ion-sized modeling should lead to an ion distribution function that better agrees with detailed experiments. However, this is not always true. It depends on PB model parameters that are chosen while setting up the computational system. One observation from the above discussion is that there are different models that can be used to solve the PB equations and produce results in agreement with experimental data. The large number of choices makes it harder to choose
the best computational model for the problem at hand. For example, one needs to specify the type of molecular surface used to define the dielectric boundary and how to treat the solvent dielectric region (especially near the A-RNA). One also has to decide what PB parameters to use (e.g., ion size). In particular, the best ionic radii to be used in size-modified Poisson Boltzmann equation (in the sense of a better agreement with experiment) are rarely known. Thus, different groups consider ion sizes as fitting parameters in their studies (23,24). It is important to say at the beginning that atomically detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ionRNA interactions are not perfect. Probably the most uncertain factor is the force field. The model we discuss below includes only point charges, while the inclusion of polarization effects (e.g., when Mg2þ interacts with its solvation shell (25,26)) are found to be important. Nevertheless, our explicit solvent MD simulation passes the following tests: 1), it was able to correctly predict the tight binding positions of Mg2þ on the A-RNA surface, as observed in crystallographic studies (7); 2), it successfully reproduced ASAXS measurements of the number of bound ions associated with A-RNA; and 3), it accurately reproduced the ASAXS spectra of excess ions around A-RNA in ionic solution (27). The same atomically detailed model is used here for comparing the replica exchange molecular dynamics and PB approaches (A-RNA with explicit TIP3P water molecules, point charge models for mobile ions). Therefore, the comparison between MD and PB approaches include an indirect comparison to experiments. Moreover, we expect to have more confidence in a theoretical result if the two different theoretical methods agree. The comparison below helps us decide to which results we can assign a higher confidence. The difference between MD and PB approaches is that for a given force field, MD simulations are essentially parameter-free. Provided that the simulations are statistically converged, the binding sites and distribution functions are direct results of the simulations. Of course, MD simulations are more expensive than PB by factors of tens of thousands (minutes versus months of CPU time). PB calculations with an effective ion size and a choice of dielectric models have considerably more freedom compared to MD. We attempt below to identify some of these choices from more physical principles and bring PB-based ion distribution closer to MD in short- and long-range distances from the A-RNA. Our comparison of PB and MD studies suggests a unique opportunity of assessing a different set of theoretical assumptions and further exploring numerical approaches for quantitative calculations of ionic clouds around nucleic acids. A similar type of approach is taken by others. In their studies they compare MD with NLPB for nucleic acids immersed in monovalent ionic solutions (28,29). We extend these studies to size-modified Poisson Boltzmann formalism with a distance-dependent dielectric

METHODS
The biomolecular system
We consider the RNA sequence (GCAUCUGGGCUAUAAAAGGGCG UCG) and its complementing strand that forms A-RNA. The three-dimensional structure of the A-RNA is generated using the Nucleic Acid Builder software package (30) (Fig. 1). This particular A-RNA structure is used because ion distributions obtained with SAXS and ASAXS techniques are available (24). We compare the ion distributions around A-RNA in different ionic solutions obtained using different PB models and parameters with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.
Size-modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation with variable ion sizes
The A-RNA is embedded in aqueous solutions of either pure salts such as MgCl2 and NaCl or a mixture of these salts. We describe below the theory for size-modified Poisson Boltzmann equation (SMPB) for three different ions. The formulation is extendible for any number of ion types. We assume that the ion species have different volumes that are made to fit the lattice with a whole number of ions,
a3
k : a3
m : a3; (1)
where a is the diameter of the largest ion, and k and m are integers with k R m R 1. The nonuniform SMPB is derived from a lattice gas approach (31). We report below calculations with SMPB and NLPB described below. For the SMPB we extended the derivation given in Chu et al. (23), by accounting for an arbitrary number of ion sizes. Here, we briefly outline our generalized nonuniform ion SMPB approach that is presented elsewhere (32). We implemented the generalized SMPB formulation by modifying the Aquasol PB solver (33).

where ε(r) is the spatial-dependent dielectric constant, 4(r) is electrostatic potential, rf(r) is the charge density of solute, a is the diameter of the largest ion, and ei is the charge of ith ion. In every cell of the lattice we can find at most one large ion, or an integer number of smaller ions. The grand canonical partition function of ions in a single lattice cube, zcell(r), is given by

Numerical integration of ion distribution
The NLPB and SMPB equations are solved with the AQUASOL PB solver (33). To obtain continuous representation of the energy, the electrostatic potential is interpolated from values at the Cartesian grid points using a trilinear interpolation scheme:

Here xi, yi, and zi values represent the location of one of the eight corners of the Cartesian grid around the arbitrary point (x, y, z). When one or more of the corners are inside the solute, the electrostatic potential is computed from the closest corner outside the solute. We used a 225  225  225 A ̊ 3 box with a grid spacing of 0.5 A ̊ in all our NLPB and SMPB calculations. To get a finer grid with less memory allocation we incorporated cylindrical grid points into the solver.

The ion radii required for SMPB calculations are obtained from all-atom MD simulations. We define the effective ion radius as the position of the first (and highest) peak of the pair correlation functions of the cation (anion) with phosphate oxygens of the RNA. This way, the impact of the RNA chelating groups on the effective solvation shell of the ion is taken into consideration. Although others consider the radii used in the PB calculations as free parameters to be fitted against experimental data (23,24), it is more reassuring to determine these parameters independently. In addition to the choice of ion radii, we need to specify the dielectric boundary that separates the solute and solvent dielectric regions. There is substantial debate in the literature about which surface should be used in PB calculations (34,35). Here, we consider two molecular surface definitions: the solvent-excluded molecular surface (SES) and the van der Waals (vdW) surface. Moreover, we treat the solute and solvent dielectric regions using two different dielectric models. Our first dielectric model, called Option 1, assumes a dielectric constant of one for the A-RNA and a uniform dielectric of e 1⁄4 78.5 for the solvent region. Our second dielectric model, called Option 2, assumes that the A-RNA region has a dielectric constant of 1 and a sigmoidal dielectric function is used for the solvent dielectric region. This distance-dependent solvent dielectric function was parameterized by computing the dielectric constant from all-atom MD simulation (36) of B-DNA, and is of the form

with a 1⁄4 sr, s 1⁄4 1.2, ε 1⁄4 78.5, and εi 1⁄4 1.76, and r is the closest distance from the set of A-RNA atoms that are not directly exposed to the solvent: backbone oxygen [ O50], major groove atoms [N7, N6, N1, O4, O6, N4], and minor groove atoms [N9, N3, N2, O2X] to the grid point. The set of atoms are chosen by visual inspection of the ion-binding sites in MD simulations and they are consistent with crystallographic binding sites (37). The parameters used in Eq. 8 were for B-DNA (36). We use them here for A-RNA to have an alternative to the discontinuous dielectric model (Option 1), which (as we show below) is not satisfactory. Another alternative that we did not test is of a dipolar solvent model (38), which may obviate the need to use a rather empirical distance-dependent solvent dielectric function.
Molecular dynamics simulation
The details of the MD simulation are discussed elsewhere (37). However, for the completeness of this article we summarize them below. Ion distributions are calculated from all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations (39) where the A-RNA is solvated with explicit (TIP3P (40)) water molecules and ions. We used the MOIL suite of programs (41) for simulations with water, ion, and A-RNA. The force-field parameters are from OPLSAA (42). The same parameters (atomic radii and partial charges for A-RNA) are also used in the PB calculations discussed above. Throughout the simulations, the A-RNA molecule is kept rigid to focus on the properties of the ions and for easier comparison with PB calculations. A variant of SHAKE (43) was implemented for keeping water molecules rigid (44). Particle-mesh Ewald (45) was used to compute long-range electrostatics with a real-space cutoff of 12A ̊ and 9A ̊ for Lennard-Jones interactions. We used a time step of 1.5 fs with a total simulation time of ~20 ns for each of the biomolecular systems discussed below. In both PB calculations and MD simulations we consider A-RNA immersed in four types of ionic solutions: The first ionic solution contains 0.4 M NaCl. Sodium is a monovalent cation that binds primarily diffusively to A-RNA. The second ionic solution contains 0.1 M SrCl2. Strontium is a divalent cation with a significantly higher potential for effective screening of charges.
The third ionic solution contains 0.2 M MgCl2. Magnesium is also a divalent cation but of smaller size compared to strontium, making it a good candidate to bind tightly to a specific A-RNA site. Additionally, magnesium also contributes to the diffusive ion cloud around A-RNA. The larger size of strontium makes tight binding less favorable. The last type of ionic solution contains mixtures of NaCl and MgCl2. We used three different salt mixtures with varying magnesium and sodium ratios: (0.15 M MgCl2 and 0.1 M NaCl), (0.1 M MgCl2 and 0.2 M NaCl), (0.05 M MgCl2 and 0.3 M NaCl). The simulations were conducted in the NVT ensemble. The temperature was enforced by velocity scaling. We used a periodic box of 118  118  88.8  ̊A3 filled with a total of 119,207 particles for the RNA-Sr2þ simulation. For the rest of the biomolecular systems the box size was 58.8  58.8  88.2 A ̊ 3 with ~29,200 particles. The larger box was used to test for possible long-range electrostatic effects and no such effects were found. Therefore, the use of the smaller box is adequate. For better sampling we used the replica exchange method where each system was run with multiple replicas that have different temperatures. We swap neighboring replicas by a Monte Carlo procedure. To ensure good overlap of the potential energy distributions of neighboring temperatures, 88 replicas were required for the RNA-Sr2þ system in the temperature range of 300–380 K. For each of the other cases, with significantly smaller number of particles, we used only 64 replicas in the temperature range 300–450 K.
Calculations of radial ion distribution and number of bound ions around A-RNA
We calculate the radial ion concentration from the last ~15 ns of the allatom molecular dynamics simulations. The radial ion concentrations, c(r), are computed from
cðrÞ 1⁄4 K DnðrÞ
DVðrÞ 1⁄4 K nðr þ DrÞ  nðrÞ
Vðr þ DrÞ  VðrÞ; (9)
where r is the radial distance from the central axis of A-RNA (see Fig. 1), n(r) is the number of ions within the cylindrical volume V(r) 1⁄4 pr2d (in A ̊ 3), and d is the height of the cylinder along the z axis. The height is 78  ̊A while the length of the 25 basepair RNA duplex is 74 A ̊ . The prefactor K 1⁄4 1027/NA converts the number to molarity where NA is Avogadro’s number. The computed ionic distribution was tested for statistical convergence as described elsewhere (37). Note that c(r) defined in Eq. 9 does not account for the volume excluded by A-RNA. Hence, the definition is slightly different from the one presented before (37). The bulk ion concentrations were determined from the MD simulations by examining the concentration at the edge of the box. These concentrations were used in PB calculations. Error bars in the MD results are estimated by calculating c(r) using 5–10, 10–15, and 15–20 ns blocks and taking the average and standard deviation of the three sets. The procedure tests ergodicity and standard deviation. See Kirmizialtin and Elber (37) for more details. The number of bound ions around A-RNA, a quantity that can be measured experimentally, is calculated from c(r) as
NðrÞ 1⁄4 2p
ZN
0
ðcðrÞ  cbulkÞrdr; (10)
where cbulk is the bulk ion concentration. The term c(r) approaches the bulk value and the integrand vanishes at ~20 A ̊ for divalent ions and 30  ̊A for the monovalent ions, which is significantly shorter than the box size. The volume excluded by RNA is ~5% of the total cylindrical volume at distance R, and thus is ignored in our number of bound ion calculation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Radial ion concentration profiles around A-RNA
0.4 M NaCl
Shown in Fig. 2, a and b, are radial concentration profiles of sodium ions around A-RNA computed using a PB solver and MD simulations. In Fig. 2 a, we report results with Option 1 for the dielectric model whereas in Fig. 2 b, Option 2 for the dielectric model is used (see Methods for a description of the two options). NLPB calculations were done with a 2.4 A ̊ ion-exclusion layer (the so-called Stern layer). To define the dielectric interface separating the solute and solvent regions we used two methods: 1), solvent-excluded surface (SES) with water as the rolling probe of radius 1.4 A ̊ , and 2), vdW surface. Note that we did not use an
ion exclusion region in the SMPB because we already accounted for ion size effects by means of a lattice gas formulation. MD simulations show three peaks in the Naþ ion distributions around the A-RNA. The first two are close to A-RNA. They are attributed to structural features of A-RNA and specific ion-binding sites. The first peak corresponds to the binding of ions to the major and minor grooves located at r 1⁄4 3–7 A ̊ , and the second peak is at the surface and corresponds to the binding of cations to the oxygen molecules of the phosphates at r 1⁄4 9–11 A ̊ . The third peak lies on the outer surface of the A-RNA (see Fig. 1, b and c). In Fig. 2, a and b, the third peaks of MD and SMPB agree quite well. Interestingly, in NLPB with a Stern layer all peaks are shifted to larger distances from the A-RNA surface. The reason for the discrepancy is likely to be the Stern layer, which is widely used in PB calculations. We also used SMPB with ion radius set to 4.8 A ̊ . These results were poor compared to SMPB calculations with ion radius of 2.4 A ̊ , illustrating the importance of an adequate choice of ionic radius. The sizes of all the ions used in the calculations are summarized in Table 1. The first and the second peaks are not in great agreement, which is expected for ion distribution functions that depend on short distances from the A-RNA. Nevertheless, we tried to improve the agreement between PB and MD by examining different dielectric models. When we used the solvent dielectric function defined in Eq. 8, an increase in the height of the first and second peaks (as compared to Fig. 2 a) is observed. The ion distributions now agree well with MD simulations. Of all PB calculations, the choice of solventexcluded surface with water as the rolling probe with radius 1.4 A ̊ and with a distance-dependent solvent dielectric function adapted from Young et al. (36) gives the best agreement with MD. The use of vdW predicts an ion distribution profile that is comparable to that of the SES. It is remarkable that the empirical solvent dielectric function designed for B-DNA works quite well for ionic clouds around A-RNA. Yet there is still a region between 5 A ̊ < r <8 A ̊ where the ion distributions obtained by MD and PB do not agree. PB predicts a higher cation concentration at this region and the reason is not obvious. One explanation is the presence of ion-ion correlation effects. MD simulations show that mobile ions of opposite charges strongly correlate near A-RNA (see Fig. 10, e and f, of Kirmizialtin and Elber

(37) and an earlier observation in Feig and Pettitt (46)). In MD we observe a chloride peak at 7 A ̊ < r <10A ̊ , which depletes the positive ions in this region probably due to excluded volume effect. The approach of chloride ions to A-RNA is assisted by their interaction with mobile cations. This type of correlation is not included in the PB calculations. Indeed, our PB results show a monotonic increase in the concentration of chloride ions as a function of r (results not shown). Near the A-RNA the PB-based chloride ion density is also smaller than that of MD (results not shown).
0.1 M SrCl2
As a second comparison, we computed the radial strontium ion concentration around the same A-RNA. Sr2þ is a divalent ion that has a vdW parameter similar to that of Naþ ðsSr2þ 1⁄4 3:1 A; sNaþ 1⁄4 3:3 AÞ in the force field employed here. Strontium ion distributions obtained with MD and PB show trends similar to that of sodium ions (see Fig. 3, a and b). The agreement between the ion distributions produced with SMPB and MD is quite good at distances far from the A-RNA (but so are cylindrical linear PB models (37)), whereas it is worse at short distances. The best results are obtained when a distance-dependent solvent dielectric function is employed (Fig. 3 b). The peak heights are slightly lower in SMPB compared to the MD results but the peak positions are in good agreement. We used the Stern layer of width equal to the ion size of the cation of interest (2.3 A ̊ for strontium). Similar to the sodium study, NLPB with Stern layer substantially shifts the peaks from the A-RNA surface and makes the results worse. We also tried NLPB without a Stern layer. The peaks shifted to the right direction but the results showed unrealistically high ion densities in some grid points near the A-RNA (results not shown). Again, of all the PB dielectric models and parameter choices made, distance-dependent solvent dielectric with the SES (probe radius of 1.4 A ̊ ) and Sr2þ ion radius of 2.3 A ̊ gives us the best agreement with MD. The vdW surfaces predict a fairly similar distribution as the SES.
0.2 M MgCl2
In Fig. 4, a and b, we compare magnesium radial distributions around A-RNA in 0.2 M MgCl2 solution, obtained with MD and PB. Magnesium ion has a van der Waals parameter ðsMg2þ 1⁄4 1:6 AÞ smaller than the other cations we discussed previously, which results in a high local charge density. Magnesium therefore binds tightly to its first solvation shell and keeps it in all conditions. Its effective ion size is therefore larger than the other cations (see Table 1). Mg2þ binds specifically to the major grooves of A-RNA and has very distinct binding motifs as observed in crystal structures (7). Not surprisingly, Mg2þ and Sr2þ ion distributions are quite different in MD simulations as illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. The most obvious differences are: 1), the height of the first peak, which is approximately two times higher
than the peak height for Sr2þ, and 2), the positions of the second and third peaks are different. Unlike Naþ and Sr2þ, where radial distribution functions obtained with PB and MD were in good agreement, radial concentration of magnesium ions predicted by PB does not agree well with MD simulations near the A-RNA (the first two peaks of the distribution functions). The first peak is not reproduced and the second and third peaks of PB are different from the single peak in MD (Fig. 4 a). The use of the distance- dependent solvent dielectric function did not reduce the differences between the two distributions obtained with PB and MD (Fig. 4 b). This result suggests, not surprisingly, that PB-based continuum description of electrostatics is not appropriate for tight binding of magnesium to highly charged biopolyelectrolytes.

ions (i.e., 0.3 M NaCl and 0.05 M MgCl2). As shown in the previous case (Fig. 4), the probability densities of Mg2þ ions far from A-RNA (third peak) computed with MD and PB approaches are in good agreement (see Fig. 5 a). However, PB and MD magnesium ion distributions at short distances from A-RNA disagree. This observation does not change when the distance-dependent solvent dielectric function is used (Eq. 8). Moreover, we vary the radius of the magnesium ion 0.7 A ̊ increments between 0 and 5.6 A ̊ (result for 1.4 A ̊ is shown in Fig. 5 a) but the agreement between MD and SMPB did not improve, implying that using ion size as a fitting parameter would not help. It is interesting to note that the SMPB result of Naþ ion distribution around A-RNA in the salt mixture is still in good agreement with the MD simulations (see Fig. 5 b). This result suggests that two cations interact weakly with each other in our system.
Number of bound ions associated with A-RNA
The number of ions bound to a highly charged polyelectrolyte is an important observable because it can be measured directly using experimental techniques (5,6,27). Here, we compare the MD results to PB calculations. The number of ions bound to the A-RNA is computed by integrating the radial density function from zero to the distance in which the asymptotic bulk distribution of the counterions is reached. We consider below both the sodium and the magnesium ion distributions around A-RNA. We report our results for ion mixtures such that the concentration of chloride ion in the bulk ionic solution is the same. The sodium ion spatial densities were quite similar in PB and MD. Therefore, we expect that the number of bound sodium ions associated with A-RNAwill also agree. The distributions of magnesium ions are, however, quite different in the two calculations—PB and MD—suggesting that the number of bound ions may be different too. Interestingly, Fig. 6 shows

remarkable agreement between MD and PB for the number of sodium and magnesium ions bound to A-RNA. The number of bound ions does not depend on the local details of charge distribution and precise modeling of ion size effects (results not shown). Not surprisingly, the number of bound ions measured by ASAXS for the same A-RNA show good agreement with our results (27). Experiments found 34 5 3 excess ions for the monovalent ion and 20 5 2 for the divalent ion in the pure salt solutions (27), whereas the number of Na(Mg) ions computed with the SMPB is 35(21) whereas it is 32(19) in MD (see Fig. 6). One should bear in mind that the number of bound ions is an averaged quantity. Averaging sometimes helps to cover detailed differences, as is seen in this case. Nevertheless, there is still hope for experimental differentiation between the computational results. Spatial distributions of ions can be recovered experimentally using low-angle x-ray scattering and measurements of structure factors. Structure factors are related to the pair correlation functions by Debye transform (47). It is therefore expected that experiments will assess the accuracy of the computational techniques using higher resolution data that reflect on detailed distribution functions.
FINAL REMARKS
The PB approach is widely used to compute the distributions and energies of mobile counterions around biological polyelectrolytes (16,17,23,48–50). Despite numerous successes one should bear in mind that the continuum and mean-field based PB equations are most appropriate at large distances
and deviation from experiment and detailed all-atom simulations are expected at short-range distances and especially near large electric fields. As experimental approaches are fine-tuned to provide a more atomistic picture of the ion clouds around RNA, deviations between experiment and PB theory have been observed. For example, in Bai et al. (51) it was suggested that PB theory fails to properly account for the interactions between two DNA duplexes in the presence of magnesium due to the low magnesium ion screening. The PB formulation neglects direct and explicit interactions between ions (the so-called ion-ion correlations), and at best approximates the finite ion size. The impact of these approximations is not obvious. The more expensive explicit solvent MD approach cannot be used efficiently for large macroions under a wide range of ionic solution conditions. However, the MD approach avoids both of these approximations and is therefore a useful tool to explore the impact of these approximations. Any comparison between PB and MD should be done carefully, making sure that calculation setups used, such as the force-field parameters, are as similar as possible. Here, we focus on the SMPB that takes into account finite ion sizes using a lattice gas theory (20). To allow for a more meaningful comparison with MD, these PB parameters were based on MD. We define the ion radius as the position (distance) of the first peak in the pair correlation function of the ion and the RNA phosphate oxygens. The results are reported in Table 1. This choice is still uncertain, because the effective radius of a mobile ion (including the solvation shell) can change following its proximity to the polyelectrolyte. However, the above definition is clearly sensible for distances close to A-RNA and is therefore a useful starting point for the desired comparison between MD and PB. The treatment of the solvent dielectric near highly charged interfaces such as A-RNA is more complex. Although calculations of a solvent dielectric constant by explicit solvent MD simulations are possible, they are extremely expensive and hard to converge statistically (52). Moreover, here we are interested in the solvent dielectric constant profile near the molecular surface (not bulk). The lower statistics at the interface makes the determination of the solvent dielectric function even more difficult. We therefore did not compute the solvent dielectric function with simulations but consider instead two empirical choices. The first choice was the common approach of assuming a uniform solvent dielectric constant of 78.5 for the whole solvent region, and 1 for the RNA. The second choice is that an empirical solvent dielectric function proposed in Young et al. (36) is assumed. The first option is the more widely used; however, the comparison between PB and MD was poor across all types of ions and solution conditions at short distances from the A-RNA. The second option led to a remarkable agreement between MD and SMPB for

the distribution functions for sodium and strontium ions around A-RNA, supporting the argument that ion radii in the SMPB model can be chosen on physical grounds and still allow for good agreement with atomically detailed simulations, if a solvent dielectric function is chosen appropriately. In contrast, the magnesium radial distribution profiles around A-RNA shows significant differences between MD and PB, even when the distance-dependent solvent dielectric function is used. Both peak heights and locations are shifted considerably when the two approaches are compared. A plausible explanation for this difference would be ion-ion correlation effects. In Kirmizialtin and Elber (37) we illustrate that negative ions (chloride) are assisted by the mobile cations and are able to penetrate the neighborhood of A-RNA. We also showed that this penetration is higher for Mg2þ than for Naþ. No such penetration is observed in PB. The presence of negative ions helps to localize the distribution functions of cations. We stop short of saying that MD is better than PB, though experimental evidence suggests that MD is adequate at both short- and long- distances from highly charged nucleic acids (27,37). MD is also approximate. For example, the force field does not include polarization. The final judge of correctness should be a detailed experiment that probes local, near RNA properties. Nevertheless, the agreement between two different types of numerical methods over for a wide range of parameters is reassuring.
