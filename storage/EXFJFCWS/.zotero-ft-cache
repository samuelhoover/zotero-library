Cellular processes are tightly coordinated in both space and time to ensure proper biological function. Disrupting this precise spatiotemporal regulation can have devastating pathological consequences, as exemplified by the broad dysregulation of basic cellular processes in cancer, including transcription, genomic integrity, quality control pathways and intracellular signalling1–6, which underlies the acquisition of disease hallmarks such as uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, increased cell survival, and metabolic reprogramming7–9. Unravelling the mechanisms of spatiotemporal coordination in biological pathways can therefore shed light on the molecular basis of pathway disruption in cancers. Spatiotemporal control is often achieved by sequestering biological reactions within discrete subcellular compartments, such as organelles, with distinct biochemical environments. Increasingly, subcellular compartmentation is being found to arise through higher-order molecular assemblies, variously known as membraneless organelles, droplets, puncta, granules and, of late, biomolecular condensates, formed via liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS)10. Biomolecular condensates lack the lipid membranes of classic intracellular organelles
focusing specifically on the role of LLPS in controlling nuclear function, regulating cellular quality control and organizing biochemical networks, followed by a discussion of recent studies highlighting the emerging view of dysregulated LLPS as a cryptic driver of cancer pathology. Finally, we look ahead to future strategies for investigating the molecular function and therapeutic potential of LLPS in cancer.
Phase separation at a glance
LLPS describes the spontaneous demixing of a homogeneous solution into two or more distinct phases. Phase separation occurs when interactions among subsets of molecules overcome the tendency to remain disordered in solution (entropy)11,17, causing these molecules to become enriched in the demixed (condensed) phase and depleted from the bulk (diffuse) solution (Fig. 1a). Surface tension causes the condensed phase to adopt a spherical shape and form droplets within the diffuse phase. Molecular interactions also shift the free-energy landscape such that, although individual molecules freely diffuse between phases, there is no chemical potential difference across the phase boundary, and thus no net diffusive flux, despite a dramatic concentration gradient. Hence, the two phases dynamically exchange material over short timescales (for example, seconds) (Fig. 1b) while stably coexisting over long timescales (for example, minutes or hours). First suspected over a century ago18, the biological significance of LLPS is evidenced by the many membraneless structures found in cells10: these spherical bodies rapidly form and dissolve, can fuse and be deformed by shear flow, and exhibit dynamic internal organization (Fig. 1b), as first revealed through elegant studies of Caenorhabditis elegans germline granules19. Biomolecular LLPS is driven by multivalency or the ability to engage in multiple weak interactions that rapidly form, break and reform10,17. Proteins achieve multivalency via tandem binding modules as well as through repetitive motifs, often containing aromatic or charged residues, within stretches of low sequence complexity (Fig. 1c). These interactor domains, called stickers, are typically interspersed between unfolded loops or within intrinsically disordered regions
as well as the fixed stoichiometries of more traditional macromolecular complexes, instead being defined by weak, multivalent interactions between biological polymers (for example, proteins, RNA and DNA), which coalesce into stable, micron-sized bodies with distinct compositions from the cellular milieu10,11. The past decade has revealed a pervasive role for biomolecular condensates in organizing myriad biochemical pathways throughout the cell, upending established views of cellular compartmentation via membrane-bound organelles. Recent evidence has also begun to highlight the particular importance of biomolecular condensates in not only controlling cancer-related processes but also in directly promoting oncogenic dysregulation12–16, thus helping to reconcile conflicting observations and longstanding mysteries in the field while also opening up new avenues for investigating disease pathology and treatment. Here, we examine how compartmentation via LLPS defines the biochemical landscape of cancer cells. We first summarize the thermodynamic and molecular principles underlying LLPS and the formation of biomolecular condensates. Then, we take a detailed look at several key cellular processes that are critical to cancer development,
Liquid–liquid phase separation drives cellular function and dysfunction in cancer
Sohum Mehta and Jin Zhang
Abstract | Cancer is a disease of uncontrollably reproducing cells. It is governed by biochemical pathways that have escaped the regulatory bounds of normal homeostatic balance. This balance is maintained through precise spatiotemporal regulation of these pathways. The formation of biomolecular condensates via liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) has recently emerged as a widespread mechanism underlying the spatiotemporal coordination of biological activities in cells. Biomolecular condensates are widely observed to directly regulate key cellular processes involved in cancer cell pathology, and the dysregulation of LLPS is increasingly implicated as a previously hidden driver of oncogenic activity. In this Perspective, we discuss how LLPS shapes the biochemical landscape of cancer cells.

(IDRs), called spacers17,20 (Fig. 1c). Nucleic acids often exhibit a similar multivalent sticker-and-spacer configuration and can thus also phase-separate in the presence or absence of proteins. Together, these features promote liquid-like behaviour by extending the range over which molecules interact, preventing them from becoming too densely packed and incapable of dynamic rearrangement11. Multivalency gives rise to oligomeric complexes, whose growth decreases their solubility while simultaneously promoting additional interactions10. This positive-feedback loop drives the switch-like phase transition that occurs
at the critical threshold concentration (Fig. 1d). Considering this exquisite concentration dependence, one way that cells can regulate condensate formation is thus by controlling the concentration (for example, expression) of constituent molecules. These are loosely characterized as scaffolds, which are obligatory for condensate formation, and clients, which bind scaffolds and make up the bulk of the condensate but are largely dispensable for LLPS10,21 (Fig. 1e). Cells can further regulate droplet composition by altering the relative stoichiometry and valency of scaffolds and clients. The physical properties of condensates can also vary as condensates are not exclusively liquid-like.
In fact, as the interaction density increases, particularly among IDR-rich constituents, condensates can ‘mature’ from liquid-like to gel-like or solid-like materials10. Notably, many of these properties can be modulated via post-translational (or post-transcriptional, in the case of RNA) modifications, which can add or remove interaction sites or alter surface charges, thus altering valency, solubility and condensate dynamics10. The ability of biomolecular condensates to concentrate specific molecules within stable, defined structures whose dynamic, liquid-like interiors are conducive of chemical reactions lends itself to the

Fig. 1 | Basic principles of liquid–liquid phase separation and biomolecular condensates. a | Whereas entropy typically drives molecules to become dispersed in solution, mutual interactions among a subset of molecules can shift the free-energy landscape to favour demixing and drive the formation of a separate condensed phase. b | Biomolecular condensates display liquid-like properties, such as highly dynamic interiors capable of rapid rearrangement and stochastic exchange with the bulk solution, as well as dynamic fusion, deformation and fission events. c | Phase separation of biomolecules is driven by multivalent binding interactions. These molecules often exhibit a sticker-and-spacer configuration, in which multiple folded binding modules and/or short interaction sequences (stickers) are separated by unfolded or disordered regions
(spacers), thus achieving multivalency while promoting liquid-like behaviours. d | At low concentrations, molecules capable of phase separation interact randomly but remain in solution. Increasing the concentration of these molecules promotes nucleation of small complexes, which begin to exclude the surrounding solution. Each new interactor contributes binding sites that attract more interactors. This positive feedback loop results in switch-like demixing and phase separation (blue curve) once a critical threshold concentration is reached. e | Phase-separating biomolecules are often categorized as scaffolds, which are both necessary and sufficient for phase separation, and clients, which can selectively partition into scaffold-containing condensates but cannot independently phase separate.

formation of biochemically distinct sub-compartments. Indeed, biomolecular condensates are implicated in the spatiotemporal regulation of myriad cellular functions. Below, we highlight several key processes regulated by LLPS that also figure prominently in the pathophysiology of cancer cells.
Nuclear function
Eukaryotic nuclei comprise a multitude of distinct microenvironments essential for the spatiotemporal regulation of nuclear processes. Visible disruption of this complex architecture due to the sweeping dysregulation of nuclear function is a prominent feature of cellular transformation and is frequently exploited in cancer diagnosis22. LLPS is already known to control the formation of constitutive nuclear substructures, including nucleoli, speckles, Cajal bodies, and promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies23,24, the latter playing a prominent role in cancer25–27. Mounting evidence reveals that LLPS is the primary driver of nuclear subcompartmentation23. Indeed, biomolecular condensates are increasingly found to play an integral role in diverse nuclear processes such as gene expression28–31, DNA repair32,33 and chromatin organization34–36.
Regulation of gene expression
Activation of oncogenic transcriptional programmes causes myriad changes in gene expression, often leading cancer cells to exhibit ‘transcriptional addiction’4 via the actions of so-called super-enhancers. These clusters of enhancers were initially identified by their extreme enrichment of transcriptional regulators such as bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and the mediator complex, and are essential for maintaining cell lineage-specific gene expression5. Numerous oncogenes, including BCL-6, CDK6, HRAS and MYC, acquire super-enhancers during tumorigenesis37,38, likely marking a critical step in oncogene activation. LLPS is predicted to underlie super-enhancer function39 (Fig. 2a) and, indeed, purified recombinant BRD4 and MED1, a core mediator subunit, were shown to phase-separate via their IDRs in vitro (that is, in the ‘test tube’ rather than in living cells), while fluorescently tagged BRD4 and MED1 were observed to form liquid-like condensates at super-enhancer sites in the nuclei of mouse embryonic stem cells28,29. BRD4 phase separation also requires its tandem bromodomains40, which increase valency through interactions with acetylated histones. Recent evidence also implicates
the BRD4 short isoform (BRD4S) in driving BRD4 LLPS and influencing BRD4 function in gene transcription as larger BRD4 puncta size was observed to correlate with higher BRD4S expression levels across a panel of cancer cell lines. Additionally, knocking BRD4S alone was sufficient to disrupt puncta formation and transcription of genes including FOS, CDKN1A, CDK6 and DCPS40. Super-enhancers are also highly enriched in enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), a class of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from active enhancers and implicated in enhancer function41. RNA–protein interactions promote LLPS by increasing interaction valency42, and eRNAs have recently been shown to interact with proteins (for example, BRD4 and MED1) found at super-enhancers and to directly contribute to phase separation, although their precise role remains unclear41. Indeed, eRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein condensates were recently shown to drive rapid ligand-induced super-enhancer assembly and transcriptional activation in response to ERα binding at enhancer sites in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells43. Finally, the nucleated assembly of transcriptional regulators via LLPS has been implicated in positive feedback-mediated amplification of transcriptional activity44 (Fig. 2a). Through its regulation of the transcriptional machinery at super-enhancer cites, LLPS thus seems to play a central role in promoting robust oncogene activation and expression to establish cancer cell identity. Aspects of this model have recently been challenged by data suggesting that key proteins found in super-enhancer condensates (for example, MED1 and BRD4) are not required for enhancer-promoter interactions45–47, leading some to completely dismiss the role of LLPS in transcriptional regulation48. However, these studies do not rule out a specific role for LLPS in transcriptional activation and, in fact, observed that loss of super-enhancer-associated proteins disrupted transcription, particularly of lineage-specific genes, in KBM7 (reF.45) and SEM47 leukaemia cells as well as in mouse B cells, T cells and embryonic stem cells46. Thus, although condensates may not drive all aspects of super-enhancer function, LLPS may still play a key role. The transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralogue transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are another set of key players linked to cancer cell transcriptional addiction via super-enhancers49. YAP and TAZ are
widely transcriptionally activated in cancer cells50, driving proliferation, survival and invasiveness as well as stem-like properties. YAP and TAZ are each capable of forming condensates in the test tube as well as in the nuclei of HEK293T30, MCF-10A31 and mouse lung adenocarcinoma cells51 through their protein-interaction domains31,51 and extensive intrinsic disorder30,51. YAP and TAZ condensates associate with transcriptionally permissive chromatin regions, recruit transcriptional components such as RNA polymerase II (Pol II), TEA-domain-family transcription factors, BRD4 and MED1, and even colocalize with nascent mRNAs30,31,51, demonstrating that YAP and TAZ condensates represent transcriptionally active super-enhancer sites. Disrupting YAP and TAZ condensates abolishes downstream gene expression, further confirming the importance of LLPS in YAP and TAZ transcriptional regulation30,31,51. Curiously, YAP and TAZ phase-separate under distinct conditions. Nuclear TAZ condensates were found to form constitutively in proliferating MCF-10A and HeLa cells and were, in fact, shown to be elevated in invasive breast cancer versus healthy samples in a commercial breast cancer tissue array31. By contrast, YAP condensates fail to form in normally proliferating cells but can be induced by external stimuli such as hyperosmotic stress30 and interferon-γ (IFNγ)51. Despite their considerable homology, YAP and TAZ exhibit non-redundant functions, likely mediated by differential interactions with binding partners52. Differences in YAP and TAZ phase separation may further highlight distinct roles in regulating cancer proliferation versus adaptation and survival. Indeed, IFNγ-induced YAP phase separation conferred resistance to anti-PD1 immunotherapy, whereas disrupting YAP condensates increased sensitivity, in a mouse lung adenocarcinoma model51.
DNA damage and repair
Aberrant cell cycle regulation triggered by oncogene activation places cancer cells in a constant state of replicative stress, leading to the frequent generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)53 (Fig. 2b). DSBs are a major source of genome instability in cancer1, resulting in persistent activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway53,54. An early step in the DDR is the deposition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers at DSB sites by PAR polymerase 1, which has been shown to trigger LLPS of intrinsically disordered

Fig. 2 | The regulation of nuclear function by LLPS. a | Many transcriptional regulators, such as mediator complex subunit 1 (MED1), bromodomaincontaining protein 4 (BRD4), RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and various transcription factors (TFs), feature large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that allow them to undergo phase separation and form biomolecular condensates at super-enhancer sites. Initial binding of TFs and other regulatory proteins at neighbouring enhancer sites triggers the nucleation of additional factors via multivalent interactions mediated by their IDRs. This short-lived intermediate rapidly gives rise to a phase transition, yielding a transcriptional condensate that drives gene activation. Thus, liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is thought to play a key role in the robust, switch-like regulation of cell-identity genes by super-enhancers. b | High levels of replicative stress and excessive transcription induced by oncogene activation cause the accumulation of genome damage, including DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The binding of poly-(ADP-ribose)
polymerase 1 (PARP1) and synthesis of PAR chains at DSB sites leads to the recruitment of disordered FET-family proteins via their RGG repeats, resulting in the formation of phase-separated condensates. Similarly, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) binds nucleosome proteins near DSB sites, resulting in the formation of phase-separated condensates via 53BP1 oligomerization. Notably, 53BP1 condensates have been observed to fuse, suggesting a possible mechanism of the clustering of DSBs in cells. c | Chromatin undergoes LLPS as a result of multivalent interactions driven by intrinsically disordered histone tails. LLPS of chromatin can be modulated by post-translational modification of histone tails, such as acetylation, which disrupts condensate formation. The addition of BRD4, which binds acetylated histone tails, restores LLPS of acetylated chromatin. The resulting condensates cannot mix with unmodified chromatin condensates, yielding two distinct phases, similar to distinct chromatin domains in the nucleus.

FET proteins (fused in sarcoma (FUS), Ewing sarcoma and TATA box-binding protein-associated factor 15) at DSBs32 (Fig. 2b). Another key factor in the DDR is p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), which localizes at nuclear foci corresponding to DSB sites54. Nuclear 53BP1 foci were recently shown to exhibit properties of biomolecular condensates, including liquid-like internal dynamics and coalescence of individual foci33,55, the latter being consistent with the clustering of DSBs, which may aid chromosomal translocations56 (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, FET protein recruitment to PAR chains is mediated by their Arg/Gly-rich (RGG) LC domains32,57, which also participate in RNA binding, and PAR chains appear to compete with mRNAs for FUS binding57. Although FET protein RNA binding has not been directly implicated in LLPS at DSBs, RNA does play a role in forming DSB foci. Specifically, DSBs actively recruit Pol II, MED1 and other factors to transcribe damage-induced lncRNAs, which were recently shown to facilitate 53BP1 condensate formation55. Ironically, transcription itself can induce DNA breaks58 (Fig. 2b), and the need for cancer cells to balance repairing DNA damage with feeding transcriptional addiction likely places tremendous strain on their transcriptional apparatus. Further insights into how LLPS regulates DSB repair may thus reveal opportunities to therapeutically exploit this delicate balance.
Chromatin organization
The assembly of eukaryotic nuclear DNA into chromatin is essential for genome function and regulation. Recent work using in vitro reconstituted nucleosome-DNA arrays has suggested that chromatin is intrinsically capable of undergoing LLPS34 (Fig. 2c). Formation of in vitro chromatin condensates depended on intrinsically disordered histone tails, whereas condensates were dispersed by histone acetylation, a typical marker of transcriptionally active, decondensed chromatin. Strikingly, the addition of multi-bromodomain-containing proteins reformed droplets that were immiscible with unacetylated chromatin condensates, suggesting that LLPS can spontaneously organize chromatin into distinct physical and functional domains34. Chromatin LLPS was further increased by addition of the linker histone H1, which caused condensates to become more dense and less internally dynamic, consistent with the role of H1 in heterochromatin formation34. Heterochromatin plays
major roles in gene silencing and genome stability, and altered heterochromatin is a frequent hallmark of disrupted chromatin organization in cancer22. Another major component, heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α), has also been shown to undergo LLPS in vitro and in live cells35,36,59. Studies using purified protein showed that LLPS of human HP1α requires DNA binding or phosphorylation of its unstructured N-terminus, either of which promotes multivalent interactions mediated by a disordered hinge domain35. Mass spectrometry studies also recently demonstrated that HP1α promotes nucleosome LLPS by inducing conformational rearrangements that expose buried histone tails, thereby increasing overall disorder36. Notably, it has also been shown that the binding of specific peptides to the HP1α dimer interface can increase or decrease LLPS of purified HP1α35, hinting at a potential novel strategy of targeting HP1α LLPS to rescue chromatin alterations in cancers where HP1α expression is upregulated60. However, such enthusiasm is tempered by recent work finding no evidence of HP1α LLPS in U2OS osteosarcoma cells and a largely dispensable role for HP1α in maintaining heterochromatin61, highlighting the need for further investigation, particularly in the context of cancer.
Cellular quality control
Effective quality control mechanisms are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis62. These pathways rapidly clear damage to proteins and/or organelles incurred through changes in growth or metabolism, and/or adaptations to environmental stress. Two major quality control processes in cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, are highly interconnected pathways that also play important roles in cancer6. These and other adaptive pathways are often exploited by cancer cells for survival63–65. Recent studies have begun to uncover evidence strongly linking LLPS to proteasomal degradation and autophagy, deepening our understanding of their pathophysiological mechanisms and potentially illuminating new avenues for therapeutic targeting.
Proteasomal degradation
Proteins bound for the ubiquitin-proteasome system are typically selected and targeted via a series of adaptor proteins and enzymes that ultimately catalyse the addition of poly-ubiquitin chains, marking the target protein for degradation62. One such adaptor
protein, speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), is a known tumour suppressor that regulates the degradation of numerous oncoproteins66. While SPOP is known to associate with existing nuclear condensates, it has also been shown to undergo LLPS itself67. SPOP was observed to form phase-separated condensates in conjunction with its target protein death-domain-associated protein (DAXX), both in vitro and in HeLa cell nuclei. Phase separation was mediated by SPOP oligomerization through its self-interaction domains as well as by multivalent interaction with the DAXX C-terminal IDR (Fig. 3a). Co-condensation of SPOP and DAXX also triggered DAXX polyubiquitination in HeLa cells, which was disrupted by mutants lacking LLPS capability, indicating that SPOP utilizes LLPS for efficient substrate targeting67. More recent work suggests that the proteasome is also capable of undergoing LLPS as evidenced by the formation of proteasome-containing biomolecular condensates in the nuclei of various cell lines, including HCT116 colon cancer cells, under acute hyperosmotic stress68. Proteasomal condensates were found to be sites of active proteolysis and to form through multivalent interactions between polyubiquitinated substrates and ubiquitin-binding domains in the proteasomal shuttle protein RAD23B68. Although it remains to be seen whether proteasome condensates can be triggered by other stress conditions, cancer cells are known to exhibit severe proteotoxic stress69 and to upregulate proteasomal activity for survival70. Further insights into LLPS within this pathway may therefore yield strategies to augment the growing use of proteasome inhibitors for cancer treatment64.
Autophagy
The autophagy pathway channels aberrant proteins and damaged organelles (for example, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)) to the lysosome for degradation and recycling62. During autophagy, poly-ubiquitinated cellular components are bound and sequestered by adaptor proteins such as p62, followed by engulfment within double-membrane structures known as autophagosomes (Fig. 3b). Autophagosome formation is triggered by the activation of a protein complex containing unc51-like kinase 1/2 (ULK1/2), autophagy-related protein 13 (ATG13) and FAK family kinase-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200). Recently, the yeast counterparts of these proteins, Atg1, Atg13 and Atg17, were found to assemble

into a dynamic liquid-like condensate both in vitro and in living yeast cells71 (Fig. 3b). Condensate formation was primarily scaffolded by interactions between IDRs in Atg13 and specific sites in Atg17 dimers. Atg13 also mediated condensate localization to the yeast vacuole membrane71. ULK1/2 and ATG13 also both contain IDRs and analogously seed autophagosome formation on the ER surface72,73. It thus seems plausible
to speculate that ULK–ATG13–FIP200 LLPS occurs in higher eukaryotes. Meanwhile, p62 has previously been shown to form poly-ubiquitin-containing cytosolic inclusions in cells, which were recently revealed to be liquid-like biomolecular condensates74. LLPS was triggered by poly-ubiquitinated proteins, with longer poly-ubiquitin chains more effectively driving condensation, and also required
p62 oligomerization (Fig. 3b). In normal rat kidney epithelial cells, p62 bodies were observed to recruit the autophagosome receptor LC3 and could, in fact, be engulfed by autophagosomes74, suggesting that p62 LLPS plays an active role in cargo trafficking. Autophagy is important for cell survival not only as a quality control pathway but also as a source for raw materials for metabolic pathways during nutrient-deficient conditions. Thus, autophagy has a complex relationship to tumorigenesis, being implicated in tumour suppression through the elimination of pre-cancerous cells while also being essential for the survival of more advanced tumours by sustaining tumour growth75,76. Mutations in autophagy components, including ULK1/2, have been detected in various cancers75,77, though their role in driving tumorigenesis is debated78. Nevertheless, autophagy is emerging as a promising target for cancer therapy76, and further investigation into the links between LLPS and autophagy in cancer may yet reveal important new insights.
Biochemical pathway organization
Subcellular compartmentation through the assembly of higher-order molecular complexes is critical for organizing biochemical pathways within cells79, whether it be to channel metabolic flux or maintain the specificity of intracellular signalling. The accelerating pace of discovery over the last 5 years has unequivocally demonstrated that molecular assembly via LLPS is a major force governing the spatiotemporal organization of biochemical pathways.
Condensates regulate metabolic flux Cancer cells are typified by dysregulated metabolism. Famously, the Warburg effect was coined almost a century ago to describe the reliance of tumours on glycolysis rather than on aerobic respiration to metabolize glucose9. Rather than being a mere symptom of energetic imbalance, the Warburg effect is now understood as a hallmark of the extensive metabolic reprogramming that shifts biosynthetic pathways to meet the demands of uncontrolled proliferation9. For example, increases in glycolysis drive metabolic flux through the pentose phosphate and de novo serine synthesis pathways, both of which are upregulated in cancers and function to supply critical metabolites required to support tumour cell proliferation and survival80,81. These pathways are also both linked to the formation of the glucosome, a multi-enzyme metabolic complex, or metabolon82, that comprises four rate-limiting cytosolic enzymes involved in

Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of SPOP and DAXX is driven by the formation of SPOP dimers through its BR-C/ttk/bab (BTB)/Pox virus and zinc finger (POZ) domain, interactions between SPOP dimers mediated by their BTB and C-terminal Kelch (BACK) domains, and interactions between the long, C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of DAXX with multiple copies of the N-terminal meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain of SPOP. The BTB/POZ-BACK domain junction in SPOP also binds E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases, recruiting them into condensates (omitted from cartoon) to promote DAXX polyubiquitination. b | Simplified schematic of the autophagy pathway, highlighting the involvement of condensates in autophagy initiation and cargo loading during phagophore expansion (top). Atg1–Atg13–Atg17 condensates are scaffolded by Atg13 and Atg17, with the C-terminal IDR of Atg13 containing a pair of binding sites that crosslink Atg17 dimers. Atg1 is recruited as a client protein via its C-terminal microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domain, which binds Atg13. LLPS of p62 condensates requires the formation of p62 oligomers, mediated by an N-terminal Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain, whose C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains then participate in multivalent interactions with the ubiquitin chains on polyubiquitinated substrate proteins (bottom).

glycolysis and gluconeogenesis83. Glucosomes have been observed to form in HeLa cells as well as in human breast (Hs578T) and pancreatic (Pa04C and Pa18C) cancer cell lines83. Notably, glucosome size has been found to increase as a function of flux through the pentose phosphate and serine synthesis pathways, and Hs578T breast cancer cells exhibit higher numbers of large glucosome puncta compared with normal Hs578Bst cells, suggesting a link to cancer metabolism83. Another well-studied cytosolic metabolon, the purinosome, encompasses all of the enzymes responsible for catalysing de novo purine biosynthesis84. Itself an offshoot of the pentose phosphate pathway, de novo purine biosynthesis is also upregulated in cancers and has been implicated in therapeutic resistance85 and metastasis86. Purinosomes have been shown to rapidly form in HeLa and Hs578T cells upon purine depletion84,87, and upregulated purinosome formation was recently observed in highly metastatic derivatives of 4TO7 breast cancer cells86. Emerging evidence from HeLa cell studies also suggests that purinosomes can be induced by hypoxia88, a hallmark of the tumour microenvironment. The formation of metabolons is thought to enhance the specificity and efficiency of metabolic reactions by insulating metabolic intermediates from the bulk milieu and allowing them to pass directly between enzymes that catalyse sequential reaction steps, known as substrate channelling82, which was elegantly demonstrated for purinosomes using mass spectrometry imaging in HeLa cells89. Both glucosomes and purinosomes appear as roughly circular cytoplasmic puncta that exhibit characteristic liquid-like internal dynamics of biomolecular condensates in HeLa and Hs578T cells83,87, though additional mechanistic factors (for example, concentration dependence, sources of multivalency and scaffold-client relationships) will need to be resolved before these structures can be regarded as examples of LLPS. Nevertheless, these liquid-like metabolic assemblies are emerging as potentially central factors in metabolic rewiring. Meanwhile, recent evidence that LLPS of glycogen can drive liver cancer initiation90 potentially suggests much deeper links between LLPS and metabolic rewiring in cancer, highlighting the need for further investigation.
Phase separation in intracellular signalling Intracellular signalling pathways form a critical regulatory network governing cellular behaviour and homeostasis, the
dysregulation of which underlies multiple facets of cancer pathology3. The molecular elements that promote LLPS are common features of signalling proteins91 and, indeed, a growing body of evidence argues compellingly for biomolecular condensates as pervasive organizers of the signalling machinery. Through these studies, we are also beginning to unravel the direct functional role of LLPS in shaping biochemical dynamics.
Phase separation controls cytosolic DNA sensing and immune signalling. The presence of cytoplasmic DNA is an acute danger signal that triggers innate immunity, cellular senescence and cell death92. These responses are mediated by pattern recognition receptors such as 2′,3′-cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which becomes activated upon double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding to synthesize cGAMP from ATP and GTP. cGAMP binds the ER transmembrane receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which then traffics to the Golgi apparatus and activates TBK1 and IKK, triggering type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine production92.
dsDNA binding by cGAS was recently shown to induce LLPS of cGAS–DNA biomolecular condensates, both in vitro and in living cells93. cGAS binds DNA in a sequence-independent manner through multivalent interactions mediated by its catalytic core and its positively charged, disordered N-terminal domain (Fig. 4). cGAS phase separation not only requires its disordered N-terminus but is also enhanced by longer dsDNA, underscoring the critical role of multivalency in condensate formation. Importantly, cGAS condensates are catalytically active, and their disruption drastically impaired cGAMP production in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)93, directly implicating LLPS in pathway function. cGAMP production may be further enhanced through the exclusion of a negative regulator, the exonuclease TREX1, which degrades cytosolic dsDNA and thus antagonizes cGAS activation. In vitro studies of purified components show that TREX1 phase separates to form a shell surrounding cGAS–DNA condensates, thereby restricting its activity and prolonging cGAMP production94. LLPS thus produces a discrete biochemical compartment for efficient DNA sensing and switch-like pathway activation93.

Fig. 4 | LLPS regulates signalling pathway function. 2′,3′-cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) via its positively charged N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and its C-terminal nucleotidyl transferase (NTase) domain, which also mediates cGAS dimerization. These multivalent interactions rapidly nucleate the formation of cGAS–dsDNA condensates, dramatically lowering the concentration threshold for cGAS activation and leading to ultrasensitive dsDNA detection and cGAMP production (left). Excess cGAMP production has been shown to trigger liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident cGAMP receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which requires interactions mediated by the C-terminal IDRs in STING dimers and forms condensates containing intricately folded membrane networks. Because LLPS requires cGAMP-bound STING, these condensates may function to buffer excess cGAMP and regulate immune signalling (right).

Cytoplasmic DNA is frequently present in cancer cells in the form of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments and micronuclei generated via DNA damage and other nuclear aberrations, and activation of the cGAS–STING pathway is thought to play a tumour-suppressive role by stimulating senescence and immune-mediated clearance of pre-cancerous cells92. Indeed, many cancers show reduced or loss of cGAS and/or STING expression. cGAS–STING signalling has also been linked to antitumor immunity through host cell uptake of tumour DNA95 and tumour-produced cGAMP96, which triggers host-cell STING activation and immune responses. cGAS–STING activation thus represents an attractive therapeutic target and, in fact, contributes to the efficacy of established therapies92. However, emerging evidence that cGAS–STING pro-inflammatory signalling promotes tumorigencity97 represents a potential complication, as does the recent discovery of LLPS by STING to form ER-incorporating spherical condensates that buffer cGAMP and dampen immune responses98 (Fig. 4). Unravelling the dual role that LLPS plays in tuning cGAS–STING signalling may thus prove essential for effectively targeting this pathway in cancer.
cAMP–PKA signalling compartmentation by phase separation. The ubiquitous
intracellular messenger 3′,5′-cyclic AMP (cAMP) is involved in regulating a diverse array of cellular processes, including gene expression, growth, proliferation and migration99. cAMP is typically produced in response to G protein-coupled receptor-induced activation of adenylyl cyclases via the Gαs heterotrimeric G protein subunit. GNAS, which encodes Gαs, is the most frequently mutated G protein gene in cancer, with key mutational hotspots linked to constitutive Gαs activation100,101, implicating hyperactive cAMP production in oncogenesis. cAMP signalling is primarily mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a tetrameric holoenzyme composed of a regulatory (R) subunit dimer bound to a pair of catalytic subunits. Of the various R subunit isoforms (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, RIIβ), only RIα is ubiquitously expressed, and RIα loss through various mechanisms is linked to tumorigenesis102,103. RIα has recently been shown to undergo LLPS to form biomolecular condensates in vitro and at endogenous expression levels in cells104 (Fig. 5c). LLPS of RIα requires its dimerization domain and a disordered linker region and is promoted by cAMP binding, which is thought to induce a conformational
change in the holoenzyme that exposes the disordered linker104. Functionally, RIα condensates are directly involved in the spatial control of cAMP signalling. The compartmentation of cAMP elevation within discrete subcellular microdomains is essential for encoding specificity in the regulation of downstream targets. Indeed, the idea of compartmentalized signalling was first articulated with respect to the cAMP pathway105. The classic model of cAMP signalling has focused on cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs) as the major drivers of compartmentation through the formation of sinks that consume cAMP and limit its subcellular mobility106. However, restricted diffusion through cAMP buffering is emerging as another critical mechanism underlying compartmentation107. RIα condensates are strongly implicated as the source of cAMP buffering as genetically encoded biosensors targeted directly to endogenous RIα in cells report saturating levels of cAMP inside droplets, which was also confirmed through in vitro droplet reconstitution using purified RIα and a fluorescent cAMP analogue104. In fact, RIα LLPS was shown to be required for effective cAMP compartmentation by PDEs, with loss of phase separation disrupting PDE-mediated cAMP sinks. Notably, disrupting RIα condensates phenocopies the ability of RIα knock-out to induce cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, two markers of cell transformation, in both AML12 cells and MEFs104. Thus, it may be time to reconsider the role of cAMP and RIα in cancer through the lens of phase separation.
Condensates in the driver’s seat Alongside work implicating LLPS in basic cellular processes that are intimately connected to cancer biology, recent studies are increasingly affirming a direct link between LLPS and tumorigenesis. In particular, prominent nuclear condensates, such as PML bodies, are being shown to play an expansive role in tumorigenesis25,26,108. A striking example comes from the study of paraspeckles108,109, which have been shown to form upon activation of p53, a critical tumour suppressor that directs multiple pathways, including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and cell death110,111. p53 induces paraspeckles by directly upregulating the scaffold lncRNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in response to various oncogenic stimuli108,109,112. Knocking out NEAT1 in mice not only disrupts p53-induced
Fig. 5 | Dysregulation of LLPS as a tumorigenic driver. a | Gain of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) ability by disease-causing SHP2 mutants. Both activating and inactivating mutations in SHP2 are able to trigger oncogenic signalling by altering SHP2 conformation to favour the open state. This conformation exposes a patch of positively charged, basic residues on the surface of the SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) domain, which can then form electrostatic interactions with negatively charged acidic residues elsewhere on the protein surface, thus driving LLPS by these mutants. Condensates formed by activating SHP2 mutants induce RAS–ERK pathway hyperactivation through their intrinsically high PTPase activity. By contrast, condensates formed by inactivating SHP2 mutants gain PTPase activity by recruiting and activating wild-type (wt) SHP2 to trigger hyperactive signalling. b | Gain of LLPS by EWS–FLI1 oncogenic fusion. In Ewing sarcoma, the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of Ewing sarcoma RNA-binding 1 (EWSR1) becomes fused to the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of Friend leukaemia integration 1 (FLI1). Native FLI1 binds conserved enhancer sites containing a single GGAA consensus sequence to control physiological gene expression but is unable to bind GGAA microsatellite repeats. The EWS–FLI1 fusion disrupts the binding of native FLI1 to enhancers and also gains the ability to undergo LLPS via its IDR. EWS–FLI1 condensates tightly bind GGAA microsatellites while also strongly recruiting the BRG1–BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodelling complex, producing open chromatin sites that act as super-enhancers for pro-tumour gene expression. c | Pathological loss of LLPS by an oncogenic fusion. In the DNAJB1–PKA-Cα chimera, an N-terminal portion of DNAJB1 encompassing the J-domain (J) replaces the native N-terminus of wt PKA-Cα. Wt PKA-Cα and DNAJB1–PKA-Cα behave similarly in forming holoenzymes with PKA-R subunits (for example, RIα), in undergoing 3′,5′-cyclic AMP (cAMP)-induced activation and in phosphorylating substrates. However, DNAJB1–PKA-Cα completely abolishes RIα LLPS, which disrupts the compartmentation of cAMP signalling by phosphodiesterases (PDEs), leading to tumorigenic signalling. d | Loss of LLPS by UTX mutants disrupts chromatin regulation. In healthy cells, histone demethylase UTX undergoes LLPS mediated by a core IDR between the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) and Jumonji C (JmjC) domains. The TPR domain of UTX recruits the MLL4 histone methyl transferase and the p300 histone acetyl transferase to form chromatin-regulating co-condensates that maintain physiological chromatin states (left). UTX is frequently mutated in cancers, with the most frequent alteration being a nonsense mutation near the start of the core IDR. These mutant UTX variants (UTX*) cannot phase separate with MLL4 and p300, leading to dysregulated chromatin states and tumorigenesis (right).

paraspeckle formation but also prevents the formation of chemically induced skin tumours, indicating that paraspeckles are required for tumorigenesis108. Abolishing NEAT1 expression, and thus paraspeckle formation, was found to induce elevated levels of replicative stress in MCF-7 and U2OS cells as well as increased DNA damage and apoptosis in mouse keratinocytes compared with control cells in response to chemical carcinogens. p53 accumulation was also markedly prolonged in the absence of NEAT1 (reF.108), suggesting that paraspeckle formation triggers a negative feedback loop to limit DNA damage and attenuate p53 signalling, allowing precancerous cells to survive and accumulate additional mutations (for example, loss of p53) to drive cancer progression. LLPS of the nuclear-localized A-kinase anchoring protein 95 kDa (AKAP95), which regulates RNA splicing113, was also recently shown to directly promote tumorigenesis114. AKAP95 is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of cancers114–116, including ovarian, rectal and breast cancers, and was shown to be required for in vitro proliferation and anchorage-independent growth as well as in vivo tumour formation by cancer cells114. Knocking down AKAP95 expression in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells leads to the downregulation of pro-tumorigenic pathways (for example, cell proliferation or DNA damage repair) and upregulation of tumour-suppressive pathways (for example, senescence or apoptosis)114, suggesting that AKAP95 plays a similar role to that of paraspeckles in enabling survival and adaptation to oncogene-induced stress. The protumorigenic effects of AKAP95 largely stem from its role in controlling the alternative splicing of multiple cancer-associated gene transcripts such as CCNA2 and SMAD6, which was found to depend on AKAP95 phase separation114. AKAP95 LLPS behaviour is mediated primarily by a core disordered region (residues 101–210) that is sufficient to induce droplet formation in vitro, whereas deleting this entire region or mutating key residues blocks both in vitro droplet formation and the appearance of AKAP95 puncta in MDA-MB-231 and MEF cell nuclei114. Importantly, these LLPS-disrupting mutants lacked RNA splicing activity despite successfully interacting with key binding partners, and failed to rescue the defects in gene expression, RNA splicing and tumorigenesis observed in AKAP95-knockout cells114.
Cancers also rely on mutations that disrupt the normal functions of key gene products, either via loss (for example, inactivation, silencing or deletion) or gain (for example, amplification or hyperactivation) of function. Yet, the mechanistic link between specific cancer-related mutations and their pathological effects is not always clear. For example, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP2, a major positive regulator of RAS activation, is frequently mutated in cancers and is an emerging therapeutic target117,118. Curiously, mutations that increase and decrease SHP2 phosphatase activity both increase cancer risk119, suggesting that altered catalytic activity is not sufficient to drive disease pathology and raising questions about the actual molecular mechanism. New work is revealing that these and other seemingly cryptic mutations achieve their pathological effects by dysregulating LLPS. Indeed, several disease-associated SHP2 mutants were recently shown to undergo LLPS in vitro and in KYSE520 oesophageal cancer cells120 (Fig. 5a). SHP2 LLPS is driven by charged residues within the PTP domain, which become exposed when SHP2 adopts its open, active conformation, and allosteric modulators that lock SHP2 in its open and closed states can promote and disrupt LLPS, respectively120. The open conformation is also prevalent in disease mutants, regardless of their catalytic activity, suggesting that SHP2 mutants gain LLPS ability through their altered conformations. Importantly, both SHP2 mutants harboring activating or inactivating mutations were found to promote ERK pathway hyperactivation in HEK293T cells, which required their ability to form condensates120. Yet, whereas the intrinsic activity of condensates formed by SHP2 mutants with activating mutations was sufficient to induce signalling, condensates formed by SHP2 mutants with inactivating mutations were found to acquire catalytic activity by recruiting and activating wild-type SHP2 (reF.120) (Fig. 5a). Thus, disease-causing SHP2 mutants gain the capacity for constitutive molecular assembly via LLPS, allowing them to induce pathological signalling independent of their intrinsic catalytic activity. Many cancers are specifically driven by chimeric proteins generated by chromosomal rearrangements121–125, and gain of LLPS ability is increasingly being found to underlie the pathology of these oncogenic fusions. For example, multiple fusion oncoproteins contain intact kinase domains from receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) but lack transmembrane domains for canonical RTK signalling121, leaving their tumorigenic mechanism unclear. Recently, several variants of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4–anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4–ALK) fusion found in lung cancers121,126 were shown to form biomolecular condensates when purified in vitro as well as at endogenous levels in H3122 lung adenocarcinoma and when expressed in Beas2B normal bronchial cells, spanning a range of liquid-like to gel-like properties depending on their precise fusion architecture127,128. Phase separation of EML4–ALK variants appears largely mediated by oligomerization via EML4-derived self-interaction domains as removing these domains or mutating key residues abolished condensates127,128. EML4–ALK condensates were also shown to recruit a number of RAS-activating factors, such as SOS1 and SHP2, notably triggering their dramatic redistribution from the cytosol into condensates127. Meanwhile, negative regulators of RAS activity, such as GTPase-activating proteins, were excluded from EML4–ALK condensates, similar to the behaviour of other RAS-activating condensates129. Disrupting the formation of EML4–ALK condensates blocked the hyperactivation of RAS–ERK signalling, which was found to specifically occur through a cytosolic rather than membrane-associated pool of RAS127. Given that similar RTK fusions typically contain oligomerization domains such as coiled-coils121, gain of LLPS may be a general mechanism for hyperactive signalling by these oncogenic chimeras and, indeed, similar behaviour was observed with a CCDC6–RET fusion kinase127. Aside from altering signalling, many oncogenic fusions incorporate elements of transcription factors or other DNA-binding proteins and are directly associated with profound changes in gene regulation122–124,130, yet how these effects are accomplished is unknown. Ewing sarcoma, for instance, is typically driven by fusion of the N-terminus of Ewing sarcoma RNA-binding 1 (EWSR1) and the DNA-binding domain of the E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factor Friend leukaemia integration 1 (FLI1)123,131,132 (Fig. 5b). The resulting EWS–FLI1 chimera binds GGAA microsatellite repeats to induce de novo activation of oncogenic enhancers via chromatin remodelling, while inactivating canonical ETS sites133,134. Both EWS–FLI1 and native FLI1 recognize the GGAA

core ETS consensus sequence133,134 but only EWS–FLI1 binds GGAA repeats123, suggesting that DNA-binding per se is not responsible for tumorigenic activity. Similarly, EWS–FLI1 recruits the BRG1–BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodelling complex to GGAA repeats, yet both EWSR1 and FLI1 interacted with the BAF complex on their own, which was not sufficient to reproduce the actions of the EWS–FLI1 fusion123. Instead, the novel functions of EWS–FLI1 were shown to stem from its ability to undergo LLPS and form liquid-like nuclear condensates. The N-terminus of EWS–FLI1 corresponds to the N-terminal IDR of EWSR1, and IDR-mediated phase separation was found to be required for the tumorigenic activities of EWS–FLI1 (reF.123). Specifically, mutating key aromatic residues to disrupt LLPS abolished BAF recruitment to GGAA repeats, chromatin remodelling and enhancer activation by EWS–FLI1 heterologously expressed in human mesenchymal stem cells, whereas a minimal repeat derived from the EWSR1 IDR was sufficient to recapitulate these effects when fused to the FLI1 DNA-binding domain123. Recent work on the oncogenic nucleoporin 98–homeobox A9 (NUP98–HOXA9) chimera further demonstrates the role of acquired LLPS as a key molecular alternation driving tumorigenicity124. This chimeric protein found in leukaemia combines the NUP98 IDR, containing the characteristic phenylalanine/glycine (FG) repeats135, with a DNA-binding homeodomain and was shown to form liquid-like condensates in vitro and in the nuclei of 293FT and mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells124. NUP98–HOXA9 was found to exhibit a dense, super-enhancer-like DNA binding pattern and to drive aberrant chromatin looping within genomic regions located near leukaemia-associated genes in 293FT cells; however, an NUP98–HOXA9 mutant in which FG-repeat phenylalanines were changed to serines, which abolished LLPS, showed dramatically reduced DNA binding and chromatin looping behaviour in 293FT cells and also lacked tumorigenic activity when expressed in mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells124. Notably, a similar disruption was observed using NUP98–HOXA9 mutants whose FG repeats were below a threshold number, illustrating a direct link between multivalency and tumorigenicity. The loss of LLPS can likewise account for the tumorigenic effects of
cancer-driving mutations with no clear mechanistic explanation. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), for instance, is a rare and lethal form of liver cancer that predominantly strikes in the young that is almost universally driven by a single mutation: an ~400 kilobase heterozygous deletion in chromosome 19 joins the first exon of DNAJB1 (encoding the J domain of an Hsp40-like molecular chaperone) with exon 2 of PRKACA (encoding the α isoform of PKA-C (PKA-Cα))136,137 (Fig. 5c). The resulting fusion is transcribed from the DNAJB1 promoter, resulting in ~10-fold higher accumulation of DNAJB1–PKA-Cα versus wild-type PKA-Cα136,138. Yet, overexpressing PKA-Cα fails to recapitulate FLC tumorigenesis137. DNAJB1–PKA-Cα also differs little from wild type PKA-Cα with respect to R-subunit binding, cAMP-induced activation or intrinsic catalytic activity136,139. Instead, DNAJB1–PKA-Cα was found to completely abolish the LLPS behaviour of RIα, both when reconstituted using purified proteins and when expressed in cells104, resulting in
the total collapse of PDE-mediated cAMP compartmentation. This effect is identical to that of RIα deletion and, indeed, a small number of FLC cases have been linked to the loss of RIα protein expression rather than to acquisition of DNAJB1–PKA-Cα140. Thus, although the principal genetic alteration in FLC is PKA-Cα fusion and overexpression, the actual molecular defect appears to be loss of RIα LLPS. Similar PKA-C chimeras are recurrent in intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasms141 and, while their effect on RIα LLPS remains unknown, it is tempting to speculate on a general role for loss of LLPS-mediated cAMP compartmentation in tumorigenesis. Another example of defective LLPS driving tumorigenesis comes from work on ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) on chromosome X (UTX), a histone demethylase that plays an important role in developmental gene regulation and is also a major tumour suppressor142–144. Although UTX is mutated in several cancers145, mutations affecting catalytic activity are uncommon, and UTX
Box 1 | Tools for studying biomolecular condensates
various strategies have been used to investigate biomolecular condensates160, with new techniques continually emerging and gaining wider use. The chosen technique depends primarily on the questions being explored.
Formation and composition
observing droplet formation by purified proteins can yield key insights into condensate formation, including detailed phase behaviour, as well as composition, although purifying multiple candidate proteins is labour intensive. Alternatively, condensates can be reconstituted with cell lysates or directly in live cells expressing fluorescently tagged proteins. endogenous tagging via CriSpr–Cas gene editing29,161,162 can help avoid overexpression120, especially combined with split-fluorescent protein tagging104,127,163. proximity-labelling techniques164 (for example, ApeX or BioiD) are also increasingly facilitating unbiased explorations of condensate composition98,165,166. Similarly, individual RNA or DNA species can be synthesized for in vitro reconstitution studies, while advanced aptamer-based labelling167 and ApeX-seq168 promise to enable broader profiling of nucleic acid-containing condensates.
Physical characteristics
microscopy is widely used to investigate the physical properties of biomolecular condensates. A classic example involves imaging condensate fusion via standard light microscopy to monitor liquid-like behaviour. more sophisticated techniques, such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching169 and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, are typically used to obtain greater detail, with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching being particularly useful for measuring diffusion within condensates and molecular exchange with the bulk phase. Atomic force microscopy is also being taken up to probe not only condensate fluidity170 but also structure71,171, while other recent studies have adopted various superresolution172,173 imaging approaches29,30,127,174 as well as electron microscopy98,165,175 to extract information on condensate structure.
Function
Disrupting liquid–liquid phase separation using mutations or chemical agents (for example, 1,6-hexanediol)176 and measuring cellular responses is often used to infer the function of biomolecular condensates, and optogenetic approaches to spatiotemporally manipulate liquidliquid phase separation150,151 may further elevate these approaches. meanwhile, strategies based on the enrichment of fluorescently labelled enzyme substrates120 or binding partners148 by condensates reconstituted in solution or on model membranes have recently been used to directly monitor biochemical reactions within condensates as have biochemical pull-downs from cell lysates127. Genetically encoded biosensors are also being used to probe condensate function104,170 and a new suite of fluorescent sensors targeted to endogenously expressed proteins149 shows promise as a generalizable platform for illuminating condensate biochemical dynamics in situ.

demethylase activity is often dispensable for developmental regulation and tumour suppression142–144. Instead, UTX mutations typically produce truncated proteins142,145. A recent study identified a central IDR in UTX spanning residues 549–848 that drives UTX phase separation in vitro and in cell nuclei and is almost completely deleted in the most frequent UTX mutant, which is truncated at residue 555 (reF.142). The formation of UTX condensates was required for its tumour-suppressive function in cancer cell lines and in vivo, which was abolished by either deleting the IDR or mutating residues enriched in this region and was preserved by mutants containing an unrelated IDR as well as catalytically dead UTX142. LLPS-deficient UTX mutants showed reduced chromatin binding, which also coincided with global changes in histone methylation and dysregulated gene expression. The UTX N-terminal TPR domain was shown to recruit other histone-modifying enzymes, such as multiprotein mixed-lineage leukaemia 4 (MLL4) and p300, which also form condensates146,147, suggesting a potential scaffolding role for UTX in the co-condensation of chromatin-modifiers at key genomic sites142 (Fig. 5d). Considering the tight link between biomolecular condensates and multiple fundamental processes that both protect against cancer and drive its progression, it is only to be expected that the dysregulation of LLPS directly contributes to cancer pathology. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that LLPS behaviour is a critical aspect of protein function that, if aberrantly gained or lost, can fundamentally alter cellular homeostasis and drive tumorigenesis. These examples highlight the need to pay careful attention to LLPS when attempting to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying seemingly cryptic pathological mutations.
Concluding remarks
A clear picture has emerged that places LLPS in direct control of multiple processes that define the hallmarks of cancer. Yet, too often, the precise functional link between condensates and cancer cell pathophysiology remains elusive owing to an incomplete understanding of how condensates actually shape biochemical reactions. Bridging this gap requires expanding the toolkit for studying biomolecular condensates (Box 1). Several recent studies devised approaches combining in vitro reconstitution of biomolecular condensates with enzyme
activity assays120,127,148, while a recent strategy for targeting genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors to endogenously expressed proteins104,149 proved invaluable for dissecting in situ biochemical regulation by native condensates in living cells104. Tools to manipulate LLPS in cells are similarly essential for unravelling the functional impact of condensates. Although recent approaches have enabled light-controlled induction of LLPS by heterologously expressed proteins150,151, strategies to selectively perturb LLPS by specific, endogenously expressed proteins remain lacking. Continued innovations along these lines are eagerly anticipated to achieve greater insights into condensate function. Deeper investigation into the molecular function of condensates enabled by these new technologies will ultimately intersect with and inform budding efforts to therapeutically target dysregulated LLPS. One potential strategy for effective targeting will be to develop drugs tailored towards specific condensates and, indeed, several small molecules that disrupt LLPS by specific proteins have already been identified152–155, which may enable selective targeting of aberrant gain of LLPS without the deleterious effects of broader-acting chemotherapies. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these compounds, and whether their design principles are readily generalized, remains to be determined. Rescuing the loss of LLPS may also be possible as illustrated by the case of PML bodies, which are disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukaemia by fusion of the PML protein to retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα). LLPS can be recovered by treating with all-trans retinoic acid and inducing degradation of the PML–RARα fusion, leading to complete recovery27. Other condensate-disrupting oncogenic fusions may be similarly druggable, potentially via proteolysis-targeting chimeras156 or RNA therapeutics157,158; however, this has yet to be demonstrated. Successful treatments may also emerge from efforts to identify and target the molecular factors responsible for modulating condensate formation (for example, through post-translational modification). Further insights may also come from studying how existing cancer drugs interact with condensates159. Of course, all of these efforts remain in their infancy. Regardless, we expect the study of LLPS to foster a deeper understanding of pathological mechanisms in cancer and unlock new therapeutic opportunities.
