Abstract
Nanotechnology has shown tremendous promise in target-specific delivery of drugs and genes in the body. Although passive and active targeted-drug delivery has addressed a number of important issues, additional properties that can be included in nanocarrier systems to enhance the bioavailability of drugs at the disease site, and especially upon cellular internalization, are very important. A nanocarrier system incorporated with stimuli-responsive property (e.g., pH, temperature, or redox potential), for instance, would be amenable to address some of the systemic and intracellular delivery barriers. In this review, we discuss the role of stimuli-responsive nanocarrier systems for drug and gene delivery. The advancement in material science has led to design of a variety of materials, which are used for development of nanocarrier systems that can respond to biological stimuli. Temperature, pH, and hypoxia are examples of “triggers” at the diseased site that could be exploited with stimuliresponsive nanocarriers. With greater understanding of the difference between normal and pathological tissues and cells and parallel developments in material design, there is a highly promising role of stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for drug and gene delivery in the future. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction
1.1. Target-specific pharmacotherapy: need for nanocarrier delivery systems
With parallel recent breakthroughs in molecular understanding of diseases and controlled manipulations of material at the nanometric length scale, nanotechnology offers tremendous promise in disease prevention, diagnosis, and therapy [1]. Among the various approaches for exploiting developments in nanotechnology for biomedical applications, nanoparticulate carriers offer some unique advantages as delivery, sensing and image enhancement agents [2]. Many bioactives used for pharmacotherapy, while have a beneficial action, can also exhibit side-effects that may limit their clinical application. There has long been the desire to achieve selective delivery of bioactives to target areas in the body in order to maximize therapeutic potential and minimize side-effects. For example, cytotoxic compounds used in cancer therapy can kill target cells, but also normal cells in the body resulting in undesired side-effects. For achieving better therapeutic application, nanocarriers are considered for target-specific delivery of drugs and gene to various sites in the body in order to improve the therapeutic efficacy, while minimizing undesirable sideeffects. Improvements in target-to-non-target concentration ratios, increased drug residence at the target site, and improved cellular uptake and intracellular stability are some of the major reasons for greater emphasis on the use of nanoparticulate delivery systems. With nucleic acid-based therapeutic modalities, there is substantial need for the therapeutic molecules to be
delivered to desired sub-cellular compartments in an efficient and reproducible manner [2]. Nanoparticulate carriers can be made from a variety of organic and inorganic materials including non-degradable and biodegradable polymers, lipids (liposomes, nanoemulsions, and solid-lipid nanoparticles) self-assembling amphiphilic molecules, dendrimers, metal, and inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) [1,3]. The selection of material for development of nanoparticulate carriers is mainly dictated by the desired diagnostic or therapeutic goal, type of payload, material safety profile, and the route of administration. Preponderance of literature on nanocarrier systems is based on the use of polymeric, lipid, self-assembling, and a variety of inorganic nanoparticulate carriers [1,3,4]. The use of stimuli-responsive nanocarriers offers an interesting opportunity for drug and gene delivery where the delivery system becomes an active participant, rather than passive vehicle, in the optimization of therapy. Several families of molecular assemblies are employed as stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for either passive or active targeting. Liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, block copolymer micelles and dendrimers are colloidal molecular assemblies (Fig. 1). The composition of each class of these molecular assemblies can be manipulated to obtain nanocarrier of desired stimuli-responsive property. The benefit of stimuliresponsive nanocarriers is especially important when the stimuli are unique to disease pathology, allowing the nanocarrier to respond specifically to the pathological “triggers”. Select examples of biological stimuli that can be exploited for targeteddrug and gene delivery include pH, temperature, and redox microenvironment [2,5–8]. The extracellular and intracellular pH

profile of biological system is greatly affected by diseases. For instance, in solid tumors, the extracellular pH tends to be significantly more acidic (∼6.5) than the pH of the blood (7.4) at 37 °C [9]. In addition, the pH values of endosomal and lysosomal vesicles inside the cells are also significantly lower that the cytosolic pH. By selecting the right material composition, it is possible to engineer nanocarriers that can exploit these pH differences and allow for delivery of the encapsulated payload to specifically occur in select extracellular or intracellular sites. Temperature is another variable that can be exploited in specifically releasing the nanocarrier-delivered drugs or genes to a select target site [10]. For instance, using temperature-sensitive nanocarriers one could envision a delivery system that will only release the payload at temperatures above 37 °C. Such a system would keep the toxic drug encapsulated in the systemic circulation or upon contact with non-targeted tissue. However, on application of hyperthermic stimuli to the disease area, the drug would be readily available in a localized region [10]. Lastly, intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels in tumor cells are 100–1000 fold higher than the extracellular levels [11]. This concentration gradient can be exploited using disulfide cross-linked nanocarriers that will release the payload inside the cell. Such a system is especially relevant in delivery of nucleic acid-based therapies, such as plasmid DNA, small interference RNA, or oligonucleotide, since these molecules have to reach intracellular targets in a stable form for efficient therapeutic effect. Another possible strategy is physical targeting of drugs and genes by external stimuli (magnetic field, ultrasound, light and heat) [12–16]. An interesting example is targeted delivery of iron oxide nanoparticles using magnetic field. Upon the administration, the drug immobilized magnetite carrier can accumulate at targeted site under the direction of external magnetic field [14]. During the last decade, ultrasound has attracted growing attention in the targeted-drug delivery. Ultrasound has been used to achieve the targeted delivery to the tumor by local sonication after the injection of micellar encapsulated drugs [15,16]. In addition to tumor uptake, this technique also allows the uniform distribution of micelles and
drug throughout the tumor tissue [17]. Light-responsive nanocarriers have also gained recent attention. Designing of light sensitive polymeric systems that undergo reverse micellization/disruption under the action of light is an attractive idea that would allow external control of drug release [18]. Discussion of extensive current literature on the external stimuli is beyond the scope of the present review. Several examples illustrating approaches to designing external stimuli are available for further reading from the references [12–16].
1.2. Passive and active targeting
For systemic therapy, passive and active targeting strategies are utilized. Passive targeting relies on the properties of the delivery system and the disease pathology in order to preferentially accumulate the drug at the site of interest and avoid non-specific distribution. For instance, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)- or poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-modified nanocarrier systems can preferentially accumulate in the vicinity of the tumor mass upon intravenous administration based on the hyper-permeability of the newly-formed blood vessels by a process known as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, schematically illustrated in Fig. 2. Maeda and colleagues [19,20] first described the EPR effect in murine solid tumor models and this phenomenon has been confirmed by others. When polymer–drug conjugates are administered, 10–100 fold higher concentrations can be achieved in the tumor due to EPR effect as compared to administration of free drug [21]. The EPR effect has been also present in other diseases such as chronic inflammation and infection. Thus, the application of nanocarriers is expected to have therapeutic benefits for treating these diseases as well [22]. The tendency of nanocarriers to localize in the reticuloendothelial system also presents an opportunity for passive targeting of bioactives to the macrophages present in the liver and spleen. For example therapies can be used to treat intracellular infections such as candidiasis, leishmaniasis and listeria; where macrophages are directly involved in the disease process [23]. Other approaches for passive targeting involve the

use of specific stimuli-sensitive delivery system that can release the encapsulated payload only when such a stimuli is present. For instance, the pH around tumor and other hypoxic disease tissues in the body tends to be more acidic (i.e., ∼ 5.5 to 6.5) relative to physiological pH (i.e., 7.4). Using pH-sensitive poly (beta-amino ester) (PbAE) nanoparticles, we have found significant enhancement in drug delivery and accumulation in the tumor mass as compared to drug administration in PCL nanoparticles, a non-pH-sensitive polymer, and in aqueous solution [5–7]. Further approaches for passive targeting involve size of the nanocarriers and surface charge modulation. Nanoparticles of b 200 nm in diameter and those with positive surface charge are known to preferentially accumulate and reside in the tumor mass for longer duration than either neutral or negatively charged nanoparticles [21]. Recently, we have examined the role of combination paclitaxel and the apoptotic second messenger, C6-ceramide, when administered concurrently in PEO-modified PCL nanoparticles to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer [21,24]. Furthermore, we have shown that passively-targeted delivery of type B gelatin-based nanoparticles has been very effective in systemic gene delivery to solid tumor [25]. Type B gelatin (pI∼ 4.5) in nanoparticulate formulations is able to physically encapsulate plasmid DNA at neutral pH [26]. The physically encapsulated DNA in PEG-modified gelatin nanoparticles was found to be more effective in vitro and in vivo in transfection of reporter plasmid DNA expressing green fluorescent protein and beta-galactosidase [27,28]. Upon systemic administration in C57/BL6J mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma, the PEG-modified gelatin nanoparticle afforded long-lasting transfection (up to 96 h) upon intravenous and intratumoral delivery. Recently, we have shown that PEG-modified thiolated gelatin nanoparticles could also encapsulate DNA and
transfect tumor cells in response to higher intracellular glutathione levels [8,29]. When PEG-modified thiolated gelatin nanoparticles encapsulated with plasmid DNA encoding for soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR-1 or sFlt-1), highly efficient transgene expression was observed in human breast cancer cells and in vivo in an orthotopic tumor model. In addition, the expressed sFlt-1 was very effective in suppressing tumor growth and angiogenesis [29]. Active targeting to the disease site relies, in addition to PEG modification of nanocarriers to enhance circulation time and achieve passive targeting, coupling of a specific ligand on the surface that will be recognized by the cells present at the disease site [30]. Using solid tumor as an example again, there are several strategies that can be adopted for surface modification of nanocarrier systems for effective targeted delivery to the tumor cells or to endothelial cells of the tumor blood vessels. Since tumor cells are rapidly proliferating, they over-express certain receptors for enhanced uptake of nutrients, including folic acid, vitamins, and sugars. When the surface of nanocarriers is modified with folic acid, they can be targeted to the tumor cells that over-express folate receptors (Fig. 3). In addition, Fig. 3 also illustrates the intracellular delivery of folate anchored nanocarrier through endocytosis process and releasing its contents in response to internal stimuli. Tumor and capillary endothelial cells also express specific integrin receptors, such as αvβ5 or αvβ3 that can bind to arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide sequence. RGD-modification, therefore, has been used to direct nanocarriers to tumor cells and capillary endothelial cells of the angiogenic blood vessels. The phage display method has been used to identify specific peptide sequences that can be used for targeting tumors and other disease areas in the body [31]. For example, Schluesener et al.

[32] used in vivo phase display of recombinant M13 phages as a tool to select peptides targeting pathological endothelium of experimental rat brain tumors. One of the FDA approved targeted therapeutics is Adalimumab® antibody; a human antiTNF IgG1 used against rheumatoid arthritis is generated by phage display technique [33]. Recently, Farokhzad et al. [34] have elegantly described the use of aptamers, nucleic acid constructs that specifically recognize prostate membrane antigen on prostate cancer cells. The aptamer technology provides an additional strategy for active targeting of tumor cells in the body. Development of monoclonal antibodies against specific epitopes present only on tumor cells allows for other targeting strategies. For instance, HER2 specific antibody (Trastuzumab® or Herceptin®) modified nanoparticles were able to localize and deliver the therapeutic payload specifically in HER2 expressing tumor cells [35]. Using a monoclonal antibody 2C5 that specifically recognizes anti-nuclear histones, Torchilin's group has developed various strategies for active targeted delivery of drugs to the tumor mass using liposomes and micellar delivery systems [36,37]. Other groups have used transferrin, an iron-binding protein, for surface modification of nanocarriers for delivery to tumors [38]. Epidermal growth factor receptors are over-expressed in breast or prostate cancers, making it a good candidate for targeting gene-delivery complexes [39]. Apart from tumor, epithelial surfaces of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, muscle myoblasts and skin fibroblasts are also potential targets for gene delivery [40]. Along with targeting ability, the nanocarriers also can be tailored of stimuliresponsive property to enhance the transfection ability of the carriers. For example, Oishi et al. [41] showed that pHresponsive and PEGylated nanogels bearing a lactose group at the PEG end display endosomolytic abilities and achieving the enhanced transfection efficiency.
1.3. Intracellular delivery and sub-cellular distribution
Once the nanocarriers are delivered to the specific diseased organ or tissue, they may need to enter the cells of interest and ferry the payload to sub-cellular organelles (Fig. 4). In this case, non-specific or specific cell penetrating strategies need to be adopted [42]. Non-specific cell uptake of nanocarriers occurs by endocytotic process, where the membrane envelops the nanocarriers to form a vesicle in the cell called an endosome. The endosome then shuttles the content in the cell can fuse with lyososomes, which are highly acidic organelles rich in degrading enzymes. Endocytosed nanocarriers usually travel in a specific direction and converge at the nuclear membrane. Endosomal acidic condition is deterrent to therapeutic molecules present in the nanocarrier. This bottleneck in gene delivery can be responsible for the degradation of N 99% of the internalized DNA. Efficient gene delivery is achieved by buffering the endosomes for safe release of its contents. For example, the buffering capacity of the polycationic carriers can hamper the acidification of the endosomes, causing it to swell and burst, as a consequence safe release of trapped contents [43,44]. Specific cellular uptake can occur through receptor-mediated endocytosis, where upon binding of the ligand-modified nanocarrier with the cell-surface receptor leads to internalization of the entire nanocarrier–receptor complex and vesicular transport through the endosomes. Following dissociation of the nanocarrierreceptor complex, the receptor can be re-cycled back to the cell membrane. Recently, in order to enhance cellular uptake, a surge of research effort has been directed towards development of arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPP's) [45]. Based on the pioneering work of Dowdy's group HIV-1 Tat peptide was identified to promote non-specific intracellular localization of various molecules upon systemic delivery [46]. This observation has been supported by other groups and a number of cationic

peptides have been identified, including penetratin, to enhance intracellular delivery. The exact mechanism of how Tat and other CPP's enhance cell permeation is still a subject of controversy, but recent data show that it may be through endocytosis as well [47]. Following cellular internalization, stability of the payload in the cytosol and uptake by specific organelle, such as the nucleus, is also essential for nucleic acid-based therapeutics. Weissig's group has attempted to direct various nano-sized delivery systems to mitochondria using delocalized cationic amphiphiles and other mitochondriotropic vector systems [48]. For efficient systemic gene therapy using non-viral vectors, nuclear import of plasmid DNA in non-dividing cells is considered to be the major limiting factor.
2. Stimuli-responsive delivery
2.1. pH differences for stimuli-responsive delivery
The pH profile of pathological tissues, such as upon acquisition of inflammation, infection, and cancer, is significantly different from that of the normal tissue [49]. The pH at systemic sites of infections, primary tumors, and metastasized tumors is lower than the pH of normal tissue. For example, pH of the region drops from 7.4 under normal conditions to 6.5 after 60 h following onset of inflammatory reaction [50]. This behavior can be utilized for the preparation of stimuliresponsive drug or gene-delivery systems, which can exploit the biochemical properties at the diseased site for targeted delivery. The cellular components display trans-membrane pH gradient in normal as well as pathological conditions, which can also be used for intracellular delivery of macromolecules. Since for many macromolecules with therapeutic potential, such as antigenic peptides targeting the major histocompatibility complex-I pathway, antisense oligonucleotides targeting mRNA, or corrective genes targeting the nucleus, delivery to the cytosol becomes necessary for therapeutic effect. Cellular components such as the cytoplasm, endosomes, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi bodies, mitochondria and nuclei are known to maintain their own characteristic pH values [49]. The pH values range from 4.5 in the lysosome to about 8.0 in the mitochondria. Given these pH gradients, therapeutic compounds with pKa between 5.0 and 8.0 can exhibit dramatic changes in physicochemical properties. The apparent membrane partitioning of a weak acid can increase significantly as pH decreases its pKa and decreased membrane partitioning was observed for a weak base due to the neutralization of charges. These pH-responsive compounds can be incorporated into nanocarriers or conjugated as such to macromolecules to achieve efficient intracellular delivery and sub-cellular localization of macromolecules. Anticancer therapy is normally associated with unwanted side-effects which are largely due to non-specific distribution of drugs into normal tissue. The selective targeting of drugs or macromolecules in tumor tissue is of high interest in cancer therapy. The pH [49], surface charge [51], and density of low density lipoprotein receptors [52] are the factors that show notable differences among the normal and tumor tissues. All
these properties are known to influence the drug's physicochemical properties and are exploited for enhanced delivery to the target site. The pH is on average lower in the tumor mass and than normal tissue [53]. Since tumors proliferate very rapidly, the vasculature of tumor is often insufficient to supply enough nutritional and oxygen needs for the expanding population of tumor cells. This results in difference in metabolic environment between the various solid tumors and the surrounding normal tissue. The insufficient oxygen in tumor leads to hypoxia and causes production of lactic acid and hydrolysis of ATP in an energy-deficient environment contributes to an acidic microenvironment, which has been found in many tumors. Most of the solid tumors have lower extracellular pH (b 6.5) than the surrounding tissues (pH 7.5). The pH is compartmentalized in tumor tissue into an intracellular component (pHi), which is similar in tumor and normal tissue and an extracellular component (pHe), which is relatively acidic in tumors [9]. This gives rise to cellular trans-membrane pH gradient difference between normal tissue and tumor tissue, which may be exploited for the delivery of drugs to tumor that are weak electrolytes with the appropriate pKa [49]. The non-ionized form of weakly acidic drugs diffuses freely across the cell membrane, upon reaching a relatively basic intracellular compartment, becomes trapped within a cell, leading to substantial difference in drug concentration between normal and tumor tissue.
2.2. Temperature differences for stimuli-responsive delivery
The use of hyperthermia as an adjunct to radiation or chemotherapy of various types of solid tumors has become an area of active investigation for the past 20 years, in part due to the improvements in instrumentation and temperature monitoring technique, as well as, an increasing understanding of the biology of hyperthermia [54]. In addition, tumor cells seem to be more sensitive to heat-induced damage than normal cells. Recently the majority of clinical studies of hyperthermia have used super-paramagnetic iron oxide-containing liposomes or nanoparticles [55,56]. The liposomes and nanoparticles provide a method for intracellular delivery and localization of the iron oxide particles. Unlike the external probes that can heat the surrounding normal tissues, the magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia is appealing because it offers a way to ensure that only the intended target is heated. A typical in vivo dose of 100–120 kHz alternating magnetic field is applied to experimental tumor models for about 30 min to achieve temperatures between 40 and 45 °C. For example, radiofrequency ablation in combination with liposomal doxorubicin (DOX) has been examined as an approach to promote the DOX accumulation in highly refractory tumors [57]. Studies by Dewhirst and colleagues [10] at Duke University have shown that a greater fraction of the intravenously administered liposomes and other nanocarriers of up to 400 nm in diameter were able to extravasate from the tumor microcirculation and into the tumor mass upon heating to 42 °C in human ovarian carcinoma (SKOV-3) xenograft model. In addition, the same authors have shown a higher concentration

and enhanced efficacy of doxorubicin in tumor mass upon delivery in heat-sensitive liposomal formulations [58]. Both of these studies and others clearly point to the fact that nanocarrier mediated delivery of anticancer drugs can be positively influenced by localized hyperthermia. Heat-responsive triggered drug delivery using polymeric nanocarriers with low melting point offers additional advantage of creating microemboli in the tumor vasculature as a drug delivery depot and for restricting oxygen and nutrient supply to tumor mass.
2.3. Changes in the redox status at the disease site
The potential for nucleic acid therapeutics has grown rapidly over the past decade. Such therapeutics include the use of plasmid DNA, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, peptide nucleic acids and silencing RNAs for gene therapy to treat
genetic and acquired diseases [59]. However, limited cytoplasmic delivery of genes is a challenge facing the development of gene therapies that act on intracellular compartments. Genedelivery systems sensitive to intracellular stimuli mechanisms have been the subject of intensive scrutiny as they would allow formation of gene carriers stable in blood circulation that disintegrate after intracellular uptake [60]. Redox potential as a stimuli mechanism has been put forward in gene delivery apart from other stimuli mechanism like pH change and temperature [11,60]. A high redox potential difference (∼ 100–1000 fold) exists between the reducing intracellular space and oxidizing extracellular space that enables it as a potential stimuli for delivery of gene therapeutics [11]. Redox-sensitive nanocarriers rely on the higher intracellular reduction capacity compared to the extracellular milieu [61].

may undergo disulfide cleavage in the lysosomal compartments [62]. The glutathione pathway which controls the intracellular redox potential [63], is significantly involved in this stimuli mechanism. The use of reducible polymers for gene delivery achieves efficient gene transfection in vivo while limiting effects of toxicity. For example polyethylene imine(PEI)/DNA polyplex formed by disulfide bond enhanced the transfection efficiency [64]. Redox-sensitive carriers with long circulating ability were obtained by coupling PEG to polycations. Redoxsensitive PEGylated polylysine polyplexes exhibited enhanced blood levels of DNA [60].
3. Illustrative examples of pH-responsive nanocarriers
Polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric conjugates, liposomes, micelles, and dendrimers have been developed to provide responsive drug release behavior. A summary of the different types of pH-responsive nanocarriers is shown in Table 1.
3.1. pH-responsive polymeric nanocarriers
Nanocarriers constructed from the stimuli-responsive polymers have been proposed as anticancer drug delivery systems. The physical properties, such as swelling/deswelling, particle disruption and aggregation of stimuli-responsive nanocarriers change in response to the changes in environmental condition. In turn, these properties alter the interactions of the nanocarriers with the cells and trigger the drug release from slow to fast at the tumor site. The pH-sensitive poly(β-amino ester) (PbAE) constitutes a novel class of biodegradable cationic polymers for development of site-specific drug and gene-delivery systems. In the acidic microenvironment of tumor (pH b 6.5) PbAE undergoes rapid dissolution and releases its content at once. Using PbAE nanoparticles, we have found significant enhancement of paclitaxel accumulation in the tumor tissue as compared to PCL nanoparticles containing paclitaxel, a nonpH-sensitive polymer, and in aqueous solution [5–7,79]. In another study, pullulan acetate, a linear polysaccharide has been introduced with sulfadimethoxine (SDM, pKa 6.1) to prepare pH-sensitive and self-assembled hydrogel nanoparticles, which also demonstrated enhanced adriamycin (ADR) release in response to lower pH and increased cytotoxicity [80]. The intracellular delivery of drugs or genes to macrophages is a particular challenge mainly because of its high degradative activities of the endosomal/phagosomal compartment. The inflammatory reactions as well as in the foreign body responses are mediated through macrophages. In addition, macrophages are also antigen presenting cells and play a role in the development of T and B lymphocytes. Therefore, macrophages are an important target to treat inflammatory and immune responses. There is a growing interest in developing pH-sensitive nanocarriers that can enhance cytoplasmic entry of genes in macrophages, such as antisense oligonucleotides, and antigenic protein and peptides. Murthy and co-workers have elegantly described the nanocarriers that incorporate three functionalities of viruses and toxin: 1) targeting ligands that direct receptor-mediated endocytosis, 2) a pH-responsive agent that selectively disrupts the endosomal
membrane, and 3) the therapeutic component which is delivered as an active agent into the cytoplasm termed as “encrypted polymers” by the authors [81]. The encrypted polymer has provided pH-sensitivity through acid-cleavable acetal bonds that link the PEGs and PEG-modified drugs or targeting ligands to the polymer backbone. These systems can target and direct cellular uptake, as well as enhance cytosolic delivery by disrupting endosomal membranes in a pH-dependent manner. A functionalized monomer, pyridyl disulfide acrylate was incorporated into an amphiphilic copolymer of methacrylic acid and butyl acrylate. This resulted in a pH-sensitive and glutathione-membrane disruptive terpolymer with thiol functional groups that can allow rapid conjugation of peptidal moieties. Oligonucleotides and peptides conjugated to this polymer show the significant enhancement in cytoplasmic delivery of these molecules [82]. The pH-sensitivity of polymeric carriers can be manipulated by controlling the length of hydrophobic alkyl segments. Stayton et al. [83] demonstrated that the pH profile of poly(alkyl acrylic acid) polymers is controlled by the choice of the alkylacrylic acid monomer (Fig. 5) and by the ratio of the carboxylate-containing alkylacrylic acid monomer to alkylacrylate monomer. Poly (propylacrylic acid) (Fig. 5) is from the family of poly (alkylacrylic acid) polymers, which is very effective at membrane disruption at pHs below 6.5 and significantly enhances in vitro transfections of lipoplex formulations [83].
3.2. pH-responsive polymer–drug conjugates
Anticancer drugs can be conjugated to pH-sensitive polymers to exploit the acidic environment of tumor. Presence of acidsensitive spacers between the drug and polymer enables release of drug either in relatively acidic extracellular fluids or, after endocytosis in endosomes or lysosomes of tumor cells. Kamada and colleagues [84] synthesized a pH-sensitive polymeric carrier, in which a poly(vinylpyrrolidone-co-dimethyl maleic anhydride) (PVD) was conjugated to doxorubicin (DOX), that could gradually release free drug in response to changes in pH

[i.e., from near neutral (∼ 7.0) to slightly acidic pH (∼ 6.0)]. The authors concluded that the superior anticancer activity of PVDDOX conjugate is mainly due to controlled release and enhanced tumor accumulation of the drug. Water-soluble polymeric drug carriers based on copolymers of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) or linear polymers consisting of PEG blocks are a group of potential drug delivery systems capable of delivering drugs to model tumors or tumor cells in mice [85]. HPMA copolymers conjugated with DOX via pH-sensitive linkage have been described [74]. Ulbrich et al. [86] have synthesized and examined the properties of antibody-targeted pH-sensitive polymer–DOX conjugates in which DOX was attached to a water-soluble polymer carrier via a simple hydrolytically labile linker containing the hydrazone bond. Hydrazone linkage hydrolytically controls the release of DOX from the carrier and its activation after transfer of the polymer–drug from the blood circulation and extracellular environment into intracellular compartments. Unlike classic conjugates, these conjugates do not require lysosomal enzymes for biological activity of the hydrazone conjugates. Drugs bound to thiolated protein carrier through acid-sensitive hydrazone linker can be released in the acid environment of endosomes and/or lysosomes after cellular uptake of the conjugates by endocytosis [87]. Anticancer drugs conjugated to serum albumin displayed greater anticancer activity, for example, in vitro studies of acid-sensitive chlorambucil and anthracycline conjugates with serum albumin showed higher antiproliferative activity, and acid-sensitive DOX albumin conjugates displayed greater antitumor activity in animal tumor models when compared to free drug [88,89]. Polyacetals rapidly undergo hydrolysis at acidic pH and have potential for development as biodegradable carriers for anticancer drug delivery. Terpolymerization of divinyl ethers, serinol and PEG can be used to synthesize biodegradable, hydrolytically labile amino-pendent polyacetals (APEGs) suitable for drug conjugation. These have been used for conjugation of DOX (APEG–DOX) and compared to HPMA copolymer–DOX conjugates which are in clinical development and found to be more promising [90].
3.3. pH-responsive liposomes
Extensive research has been carried out during the past 30 years to use liposomes, bilayered phospholipid vesicles with the anticancer drugs and gene delivery and are principle areas of interest. As a consequence some of the liposomal formulations are approved for clinical trials or in the market (e.g., DaunoXome, Doxil\Caelyx, Mycet, AmBisome). To achieve the pH-sensitivity to release active contents, the liposomes can be tailored from the pH-sensitive components. The pH-sensitive liposomes are endocytosed in the intact form and fuse with the endovascular membrane as a consequence of the acidic pH inside the endosome, and release its active contents into the cytoplasm [91]. Recent studies mainly focus on the construct of new lipid compositions that attribute pH-sensitivity to liposomes or modification of liposomes with various pH-sensitive polymers [92] and imparting hydrophilicity to the liposomal surface for longevity and ligand-mediated targeting. This
combination of pH-sensitivity, longevity and targeting ability of liposomes can effectively deliver their contents into the cytoplasm [93]. Anionic pH-sensitive phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) incorporated liposome are used to deliver the antisense oligonucleotides intracellularly. These are stable in the blood, however, they undergo phase transition at acidic endosomal pH, in turn this facilitates cytoplasmic delivery of oligos [76]. Long circulating PEG-modified pH-sensitive liposomes have been prepared using a combination of PEG and a pH-sensitive, terminally alkylated copolymer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPAAm) and methacrylic acid [94]. pH-sensitive liposome attached with target-specific ligands (folate and Tf) has been described for cytosolic drug delivery [95]. Imparting hydrophilic property, particularly by incorporating PEG by covalent linking or physical coating of the carrier surfaces, prolongs the residence time of carriers during circulation in the blood by preventing opsonization and thus minimizing the clearance in reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs. This long circulating property of nanocarrier promotes EPR effect and more valuable in passive targeting of drugs or genes for cancer therapy. This finding has lead to designing of pH-sensitive liposomes by anchoring the surface with carboxylic groups, but these failed to respond to small changes in physiological pH because of intrinsic pKa of carboxylic group. The pH-sensitive liposomes have been designed to deliver highly hydrophilic molecules or macromolecules into the cytoplasm. These pH-sensitive liposomes destabilize under acidic conditions present in the endosomes and usually contain PE and titrable stabilizing amphiphiles. The well investigated class of pH-sensitive liposomes consists polymorphic lipids such as unsaturated PE with mildly acidic amphiphiles that act as stabilizers at neutral pH [96]. The amphiphile head group gets protonation in the acidic environment and causes a destabilization of liposomal bilayer which is usually accompanied by the release of liposomal contents [97]. These systems have been successfully investigated for the in vitro cytoplasmic delivery of antitumor drugs, protein toxins, antigen, antisense oligonucleotides and plasmid DNA [98,99]. Lipids other than PE incorporated in liposomes also show pH-sensitive behavior such as cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) and poly(organophosphazenes) (Fig. 5) [93,100]. pH-sensitive liposomes prepared from the hydrophobically-modified copolymers of NIPAAm bearing pH-sensitive moiety have been examined for the release of water-soluble fluorescent marker, pyranine, and an amphipathic cytotoxic anticancer drug DOX. The release from the copolymer modified liposomes is found to be pH dependent [101]. Lipids like dioleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) form a non-bilayer structure in an aqueous medium at neutral pH but when combined with stabilizing components such as CHEMS are able to assemble into a bilayer [102]. The liposomes based on these bilayered components are destabilized in the acidic environment of the endosomes and rapidly released their contents [102]. Ishida et al. [73] have found that DOPE liposomes stabilized with cleavable lipid derivative of PEG (mPEG-S-S-DSPE) enhanced the DOX delivery into the nuclei of the CD19 epitope on B-lymphoma

cells and increased cytotoxicity compared to non-pH-sensitive liposomes. A pH stimuli release of drugs encapsulated in liposomes can be achieved both with drugs that increase as well as decrease membrane permeabilities upon acidification, as long as the intraliposomal buffer strength and pH is rationally selected. Lee et al. [103] investigated the folate receptor-targeted liposomes with three different compounds whose pKa is dependent on pH. Anionic 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein converts into non-ionic at endosomal pH and releases at endosomes. These compounds can be encapsulated into liposomes at neutral pH. As a result of decreasing pH of intraliposomal at endosomal acidic pH, the liposomal contents can be released to endosome. Another category of compounds retains both anionic and cationic charges at endosomal pH and retains at endosomes for a long time like sulforhodamine B. DOX in its cationic form in strong acidic buffer when loaded into liposomes, displays endocytosis triggered release, since sufficient uncharged DOX remains at endosomal pH.
3.4. pH-responsive micellar delivery systems
Micelles are spherical supramolecular nanoassemblies ranging from 20 to 100 nm in size that have attracted considerable interest as potential drug nanocarriers due to their unique properties such as high solubility, high drug loading capacity and low toxicity [104]. The small size of micelles is responsible to avoid rapid renal exclusion and uptake by the RES [105]. This in turn prolongs the blood circulation of micelles and facilitates their passive accumulation at tumor tissue. Many approaches have been described to the development of pHsensitive micelles that can exploit acidic environment at tumor tissue to unload its contents [106]. One such approach is attaching the “titratable” groups such as amines or carboxylic acids into the block copolymers such that the micelle formation is controlled by the protonation of these groups. Despite the fact that, only a few of these have been found to undergo transitions in the physiologically relevant pH range of 5.0–7.4 and proved to encapsulate drugs [72,101]. In their recent work, Bae and co-workers have reported the intracellular pH-sensitive polymeric micelles that can release the anticancer drug, DOX, in response to acidic pH at endosomes (pH 5.0–6.0) and lysosomes (pH 4.0–5.0), which can maximize the DOX delivery efficiency to the tumor tissue [69]. Bae and co-workers have also found that water-soluble polymers modified with a new pH-sensitive functional group (a weak acid of sulfonamide) self-assembled nanoparticles showed increased drug release, interaction with and internalization into cells at tumor pH [80]. A mixed micellar formulation has been explored for the paclitaxel, in which micelle-unimer transition will takes place due to the ionization–non-ionization of sulfamethazine oligomer in the pH range (pH 7.2–8.4) above the CMC [107]. A polyamine, poly(L-histidine) is investigated in pH-sensitive micellar systems because of its amphoteric property and fusogenic activity of the imidazole group and its interaction between endosomal membrane and poly(L-histidine) [108]. Folate receptor present on tumor has been utilized for
targeting of anticancer drugs, genes, and radiopharmaceuticals via folate receptor-mediated endocytosis [109,110]. Folate receptors are highly expressed on various tumors such as ovarian, lung, breast, brain, colon and kidney cancers [111]. In one such study, poly(L-histidine) based micelles were further conjugated with ligands either folic acid or biotin to enhance the tumor uptake by folate receptor-mediated or biotin receptormediated endocytosis [112]. The activity is further enhanced by preparing the mixed micelles [poly(L-histidine)/PEG and poly (L-lactic acid)/PEG block copolymer] conjugated with folic acid, enhanced cytotoxicity has been found in vitro using these mixed micelles. Water-soluble block copolymers that can exhibit different forms in aqueous environment have been in recent focus for drug delivery [113]. Block copolymers based on poly[4vinylbenzoic acid (VBA) and 2-N-(morpholino)ethyl methacrylate (MEMA) can dissolve in pH above 6.0. VBA forms micelles if the pH is below 6.0, whereas MEMA micelles can form in alkaline pH [114]. Triblock copolymers such as poly (acrylic acid)-b-polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (PAA-bPS-b-P4VP) have also been shown to exists in different forms by changing the aqueous pH. Poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethylmethacrylate]-block-poly[2-(N-morpholino)ethyl methacrylate] (DEA-MEMA) forms MEMA-core micelles at pH 6.5 in the presence of 1.0 M Na2SO4, whereas the DEA block forms a micellar core at pH 1.0 [115]. These unique characteristics of amphiphilic block copolymers are responsible for the special advantage of using micelles for various drug delivery applications. NIPAAm (Fig. 5) is a thermosensitive polymer that exhibits a low critical solution temperature (LCST) of 32 °C, below which the polymer is soluble but precipitates if the temperature is raised above the LCST [116]. By incorporating a hydrophilic titrable monomer (e.g., MAA), it is possible to increase the LCST of NIPAAm and make the polymer pHsensitive [117]. Polymeric micelles based on poly(L-lactide)-bpoly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)-b-poly(L-lactide) (PLLA-PEOzPLLA) ABA triblock copolymers and diblock copolymers (PEOz-PLLA) have been successfully investigated for tumor targeting of DOX [118]. Polymeric micelles consisting of random copolymers of NIPAAm, methacrylic acid, and octadecyl acrylate [119], also with adding an additional hydrophilic monomer, N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (VP) decrease the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) uptake and improve accumulation in tumors [120]. Anthracycline antibiotics, DOX and daunorubicin are known to form a dimer in an aqueous solution due to π–π stacking of their planar aromatic ring [121]. Polymeric micelles were prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)poly(beta-benzyl-L-aspartate) block copolymer (PEG-PBLA), in which DOX was converted partially into its dimeric form during the drug loading [122]. These polymeric micelles exhibited two-stage release profile, an initial rapid release was followed by a state of slow and prolonged release of DOX. DOX release was accelerated by decreasing the surrounding pH from 7.4 to 5.0, indicating a pH-sensitive release of DOX from the micelles. This rapid release may be due to the protonation of the 3′-NH2 group as well as an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the azomethine bond in DOX–DOX.

3.5. pH-responsive dendrimers
High molecular weight polymers that incorporated with anticancer drugs can significantly improve tumor targeting of drugs due to the EPR effect. However, the availability of welldefined water-soluble polymers with uniform dispersities and that are nontoxic and biocompatible is rather limited. Dendritic polymers are promising polymeric drug carriers due to their well-defined molecular architecture. Dendrimers are synthetic, spherical, highly branched, macromolecules of nanometer dimensions developed as a result of pioneering work of Tomalia et al. [123]. They have excellent control over polydispersity, and the ability to display a high surface functionality along with water solubility is one of the factors that makes dendrimers attractive for drug delivery and biomedical applications [124]. Dendrimers are capable for use in many applications mainly due to incorporating a variety of physical properties in its structures through functional group modifications at the core, branches and the periphery. Imparting a stimuli-sensitive property into dendrimers could significantly expand the scope of these macro-molecules in biomedical and drug delivery applications. The synthetic dendritic polyester systems composed based on the monomer unit 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propanoic acid are possible versatile drug carriers [125]. DOX was attached via a pH-sensitive linkage to these carriers. This demonstrated the feasibility of using these polyester dendritic polymers to prepare a viable polymer–drug conjugate. The dendritic polymer can be attached to the DOX through several functional groups that are available with the DOX. The hydrolysable amide linkage with the polymer may be too stable toward acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. On the other hand, the keto group of DOX can be used to form an acid labile hydrazone linkage, the resulting compound showed excellent water solubility and making it an excellent candidate for further biological evaluation [125]. Recently, a new approach has been investigated using PEOdendrimer hybrids as backbones for acid-sensitive micelles [126]. This approach involves the incorporation of hydrophobic groups to the periphery of the core-forming dendrimer block using an acidsensitive acetal linkage. It loses hydrophobic groups upon hydrolysis of the linkage, the core-forming block becomes hydrophilic, thus destabilizing the micelle and allowing the release of the drug from its encapsulating micellar compartment. The stepwise synthesis of the PEO–dendrimer backbone allows a high degree of control over the polymer structures. This in turn controls the properties such as the rate of micelle disruption, the critical micelle concentration, and the size of the micelles [126]. This approach has been used to deliver the DOX for tumor targeting [126].
4. llustrative examples of temperature-responsive nanocarriers
A summary of the different types of temperature-responsive nanocarriers is shown in Table 2.
4.1. Temperature-responsive polymeric nanocarriers
Temperature-sensitivity is one of the most interesting characteristics in stimulus-responsive polymeric nanocarriers
and has been extensively investigated to exploit the hyperthermia condition for drug and gene delivery [10,136]. A thermosensitive polymer displays a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in aqueous solution, below which the polymers are water soluble and above which they become water-insoluble. This property has been exploited in targeted delivery of anticancer drugs. For example, the rhodamine–poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-acrylamide) conjugates were selectively accumulated in a tumor tissue using targeted hyperthermia [10]. Thermosensitive amphiphilic polymers generally have temperature-responsive hydrophilic segments and a suitable hydrophobic segment. NIPAAm and its random copolymers are the most intensively investigated temperature-sensitive hydrophilic segments (Fig. 5) [137]. Block copolymers of PEG as a hydrophilic block and NIPAAm or poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide-dilactate as a thermosensitive block are able to self-assemble in water into temperature-responsive nanocarriers above the LCST of the thermosensitive block [138]. An amphiphilic thermosensitive nanocarrier was prepared from N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide lactate and PEG. This system showed to be a promising delivery system for the parenteral administration of paclitaxel [139]. An interesting review on triggered destabilization of polymeric micelles and vesicles by changing polymer polarity is available for further reading, see Ref. [136]. The hydrophobic segments, poly(L-lactide), cholic acid, alkyl, and poly(γ-benzyl L-glutamate) also have been used in diblock polymers with the temperature-sensitive polyacrylamide derivatives being the hydrophilic segments. Indomethacin incorporated in block copolymeric nanospheres was prepared from poloxamer and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL). These exhibited the reversible change of size depending on the temperature and were able to reduce the damage compared with the free indomethacin when evaluated by MTT assay [138]. In another interesting work, gold nanoparticles were used to prepare shell cross-linked Pluronic® (poloxamer) micelles that exhibit a reversibly thermosensitive swelling/shrinking behavior. This property of the micelles was caused by hydrophobic interactions of crosslinked or grafted poloxamer copolymer chains in the micelle structure with raise in temperature [139]. Polymeric micelles have been explored for temperature induced release of actives for drug and gene delivery. Temperature-sensitive micelles can be formed as a result from the assembly of block copolymers composed of a temperaturesensitive block and hydrophobic block. The temperature-sensitive property is possessed by the outer shell of the polymeric micelles and the drug molecules are incorporated into the hydrophobic inner core. NIPAAm is known to exhibit phase-transition temperature at 32 °C termed as LCST [137]. It shows a very sharp change in hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity in a very narrow temperature region around 32 °C. In addition, LCST of NIPAAm can be easily modified to get above 37 °C using copolymers with varying hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity. PEG is the commonly used hydrophilic segment of the copolymers forming the micelles as well as for the coating of other colloidal nanocarriers, because of its biocompatibility and good “stealth” properties [140]. The micelle's hydrophobic inner core offers an important control point
S. Ganta et al. / Journal of Controlled Release 126 (2008) 187–204 197


for temperature-sensitive drug release. Both inner cores and outer shell polymer chemistries were investigated to modify the temperature-responsive behavior of micelles for specific drug delivery [141]. AB type block copolymers consisting of a NIPAAm segment and hydrophobic segment can form core–shell micellar structures below the NIPAAm LCST. The inner hydrophobic core can be loaded with the water-insoluble drugs, while the NIPAAm outer shell plays the role of temperatureresponsiveness and aqueous solubilization. Introduction of an amino group to the NIPAAm chain raises the LCST and slows down the rate of the phase transition [142]. Cholesteryl endcapped temperature-sensitive amphiphilic polymers were synthesized from the hydroxyl-terminated random poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (NIPAAm-co-DMAAm) and cholic acid, conjugated with amine-terminated NIPAAm was shown to have LCST 37.7–38.2 °C and 31.5 °C respectively [143]. In another study, amphiphilic NIPAAm-grafted-polyphosphazene (NIPAAm-g-PPP) was synthesized by stepwise cosubstitution of chlorine atoms on polymer backbones with aminoterminated NIPAAm oligomers and ethyl glycinate (GlyEt), the LCST was found to be 30 °C in water. Non-viral vectors based on thermosensitive polymers have been proposed for effective in vitro or in vivo gene transfection. Piskin and colleagues investigated different types of cationic PEI and their block copolymers with NIPAAm as temperaturesensitive carriers for in vitro and in vivo transfection of plasmid DNA [144,145]. In this study [144], introduction of PEI units to
the NIPAAm chains increased the LCST values up to 37 °C. A green fluorescent protein expressing plasmid to transfect Hela cells in cell culture media was complexed to PEIs and copolymers. Cytotoxicity was evident with PEIs especially with the branched higher molecular weights. Copolymerization reduced the cytotoxicity. The effective gene expression without any significant toxicity was achieved with the complex prepared with NIPAAm/PEI25L. The authors also demonstrated, release of plasmid DNA from polycationic polymers in response to temperature stimuli and enhanced in vivo transfection efficiency [145]. Elegantly discussed reviews on gene therapy with main emphasis on polycationic stimuli-responsive carriers as non-viral gene vectors are available from Refs. [146–148]. Twaites et al. [149] reported DNA binding behavior of pH and temperatureresponsive NIPAAm copolymers. Plasmid DNA complexed to NIPAAm copolymers displayed variation in gel retardation behavior above and below polymer phase-transition temperatures. High molecular weight NIPAAm copolymer forming complexes with reduced affinity above LCST where a branched PEI–NIPAAm bound with higher affinity above NIPAAm phase transition. However, PEI–NIPAAm conjugate showed low level transfection efficiency. Cell viability studies showed that the polycationic polymers were toxic at high concentrations when not complexed to DNA or at certain DNA:polymer ratio [150]. PEI copolymers with side chain grafted NIPAAm were shown to be less toxic than PEI alone or NIPAAm copolymer and the effects were concentration dependent [150].

4.2. Temperature-responsive liposomes
Temperature-sensitive liposomes that show the response to the temperature above physiological temperature have been studied intensively to achieve targeted-drug delivery, since temperaturesensitive liposomes can release their contents to the target site where the heat is applied [151]. It is a well recognized fact that the membranes of various types of phospholipids undergo phase transitions, such as gel-to-liquid crystalline and a lamellar-tohexagonal transition and become highly leaky to small watersoluble molecules. A typical example is the design of temperaturesensitive liposomes using dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) as the primary lipid [151]. These DPPC liposomes become leaky to small water-soluble molecules at a gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition. The gel-to-liquid crystalline transition of DPPC membrane takes place at the clinically achievable temperature of 41 °C. Adding small amount of distearoylphosphatidylcholine as a co-lipid to the liposomal membrane can help in adjusting the desired transition temperature. Recently, temperature-sensitization of liposomes has been employed using thermosensitive polymers [152] which exhibits a LCST [153]. At the molecular level chains of these polymers undergo a coil-to-globule transition as the temperature changes. Attachment of these temperature-sensitive polymers to the liposomes can provide the liposomes with temperature controlled functionalities. For example, highly hydrated polymer chains attached to the liposomes stabilize the liposomes below the LCST, but above the LCST, the dehydrated polymer chains cause destabilization of the liposomes, resulting in release of its contents [154]. As a consequence of change in temperature dependent alteration of hydrophobicity and conformation of the polymer chains, the surface properties of liposomes can change and which exhibit temperature controlled fusion or affinity to cells [155]. Therefore in addition to targeted delivery by temperature-sensitive drug release, the modified liposomes using temperature-sensitive polymer may offer another strategy for targeted-drug delivery, which is targeting by the temperature induced control of interaction with cells. Various researchers have investigated the modification of liposomes with NIPAAm copolymers to obtain liposomes with temperature-sensitivity [156]. An interesting review on thermosensitive polymer-modified liposomes is available for further reading [152]. Han et al. [157] investigated the surface modification of liposomes by using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) (NIPAAm-AAM) and PEG. The release of DOX from the NIPAAm-AAM/PEG modified liposomes was increased around the transition temperature of the polymer. In addition, modified liposomes were found to be stable in the serum compared with unmodified liposomes suggesting that NIPAAm-AAM/PEG modified liposomes are suitable for targeted-drug delivery. Chandaroy et al. [158] have studied the temperature-sensitive di-oleoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes containing Pluronic® F127 (P-127) molecules where the P-127 interacts with the liposomal lipid bilayer at elevated temperature and causes the release of its encapsulated fluorescent markers. Concentration of the P-127 is found to be critical in destabilizing the liposomal membrane and release at precise temperature. Authors also further proved that the
stealth liposomes using di-stearoyl(polyethylene glycol 5000) phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG5000DSPE) in conjunction with P-127 showed similar effect on content release in comparison to the non-stealth liposomes.
5. Illustrative examples of redox-responsive nanocarriers
A summary of the different types of redox-responsive nanocarriers is shown in Table 2.
5.1. Disulfide cross-linked polymeric nanocarriers
The two distinct redox environments of intra- and extracellular spaces could provide an opportunity for programmed delivery of drugs and genes. A drug or gene molecule can be entrapped or encapsulated in a nanocarrier that is held together by disulfide bonds. Once the disulfide bonds of nanocarrier are reduced in the presence of low reducing potential due to an excess of reduced glutathione (GSH) inside the cell, the drug or gene present in the nanocarrier is released. One of the features required for a successful gene-delivery system is a high plasma stability that overcomes DNA release before reaching the target cells [159]. This can be achieved by incorporating the covalent linkages between polymer chains of polymeric nanocarrier, i.e. intramolecular and intermolecular cross-linking. This could stabilize the polymeric nanocarriers and inhibits dissociation and early release of DNA [160]. Cavallaro et al. [133] have prepared a polyaspartamide polymeric carriers for DNA delivery based on polycation strategy. The positively charged groups introduced on the polymer backbone for electrostatic interactions with DNA, and thiol groups for the formation of disulfide bridge between polymer chains. This resulted in formation of reversibly stable thiopolyplexes. By incorporating disulfides between polymer chains, it is expected to give polymeric nanocarrier systems of environment-sensible properties, so that while dissociation of polyplexes in the blood is avoided, once internalized, the presence of low reducing potential due to an excess of reduced glutathione inside the cell, should lead to selective intracellular DNA release [11]. Recently, FDA has approved the anti-CD33 antibodyconjugate optimized for targeting leukemic cells (Mylotarg®), this consists of two cleavable sites in the linker, a disulfide bond and an acylhydrazone bond for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia [161]. An interesting review article that focuses on biological fate of disulfide bonds is available [11]. Our group has investigated the intracellular delivery potential of plasmid DNA using thiolated gelatin nanoparticles. Gelatin thiopolyplexes can release the DNA in the highly reducing environment, such as in response to glutathione. Thiolated gelatin was prepared by covalent modification of the primary amino groups of type B gelatin using 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent). The in vitro analysis of gelatin nanoparticles containing plasmid DNA transfection in NIH-3T3 murine fibroblast cells for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-N1) was done by fluorescence confocal microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Qualitative results showed highly efficient expression of GFP that remained stable for up to 96 h. Quantitative results from FACS showed that the thiolated

gelatin nanoparticles (SHGel-20) were significantly more effective in transfecting NIH-3T3 cells than other carrier systems examined. The results of this study suggest that thiolated gelatin nanoparticles would serve as a biocompatible intracellular delivery system that can release the payload in a highly reducing environment. Recently, we have proved that a long circulating PEG-modified thiolated gelatin nanoparticles could also deliver DNA and transfect tumor cells in response to higher intracellular glutathione concentrations [8,29]. These nanocarriers incorporated with plasmid DNA encoding for soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR-1 or sFlt-1) exhibited a highly efficient transgene expression in human breast cancer cells in in vivo tumor model. In addition, the expressed sFlt-1 was very effective in suppressing tumor growth and angiogenesis [29]. Carlisle et al. [162] prepared nanoparticles of plasmid DNA condensed with thiolated PEI, and these were coated with thiolreactive poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (PHPMA) with 2-pyridyldisulfanyl or maleimide groups, forming reducible disulfide-linked or stable thioether-linked coatings. Disulfidelinked complexes showed 40–100 fold higher transfection efficiency than thioether-linked ones. This is because of the reduction with dithiothreitol (DTI) that allowed complete release of DNA from disulfide-linked coated complexes. Transfection efficiency was further improved by boosting of intracellular glutathione using glutathione monoethyl ester or decreased using buthionine sulfoximine. A glutathione-sensitive cross-linked PEI gene carrier was prepared using dimethyl 3,3′-dithiopropionimidate dihydrochloride as a cross-linking agent [163]. Thiol groups prone to oxidation were immobilized on the polymeric backbone of chitosan in order to incorporate the property of extracellular stability and intracellular gene release by forming reversible disulfide bonds [164]. Chitosan–thiobutylamidine conjugate, exhibiting 299.1 +/− 11.5 μmol of free thiol groups per gram polymer, formed coacervates with pDNA and the highest efficiency was observed in transfection studies performed in a Caco-2 cell culture for chitosan–thiobutylamidine–DNA nanoparticles that identifies chitosan–thiobutylamidine as a promising new vector for gene delivery.
5.2. Disulfide cross-linked liposomes
Disulfides (–S–S–) have found use in liposomal targeted delivery approaches. Disulfide bonds can be used as linkers for targeting conjugates and also to prepare lipids with disulfide bridges where the disulfide bond is critical to liposomal stability. Upon reaching intracellular spaces, the thiolated liposomes destabilize in response to glutathione, as this destabilizing effect is attributed to the reduction of disulfide bridges of liposomes. As a consequence, the active component encapsulated in liposomes is released intracellularly and this intracellular delivery of genes is necessary for efficient transfection. Disulfide mediated redox stimuli-responsive liposomes are prepared using standard phospholipids and a small lipid of which the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts are linked through a disulfide bond. Such liposomes exhibited stability until reaching to a reducing environment that cleaves the disulfide
bonds, disrupting the liposomal membrane and releasing the liposomal contents [165]. Thiocholesterol-based cationic lipids (TCL) were synthesized which can be used into liposomes to encapsulate DNA [166]. The resulting lipoplexes are shown to release their content in the presence of low concentrations of reducing agents [166]. Redox-sensitive liposomes with long circulating property were reported by Kirpotin et al. [167]. In which liposomes were incorporated with detachable disulfidelinked PEG polymer coating, whereby it is expected to show longer circulation, therefore enhanced accumulation at tumor site, and release of its contents into target cells in response to redox stimulus. Stearically stabilized mPEF-DTP-DSPE antCD19 liposomes were prepared to deliver the DOX into Blymphoma cell cytoplasm [73]. This demonstrated the modest increase in therapeutic activity in vivo. Lipid based mitomycin C conjugates with cleavable disulfide linkage were prepared and encapsulated in PEGylated liposomes [168]. These liposomes are found to be less toxic and superior in therapeutic activity compared to free mitomycin C.
6. Conclusions
With greater understanding of physiological differences between normal and disease tissues and advances in material design, there is an opportunity to develop nanocarrier systems for target-specific drug and gene delivery that will respond to the local stimuli. This review examined the role of pH, temperature, and redox potential responsive nanocarriers for targeted-drug and gene delivery. In addition to targeted delivery, a number of studies, especially in cancer therapy, have shown that stimuliresponsive nanocarriers can provide significant advantages.
