Using molecular-dynamics simulations, we study the thermal transport properties of graphene nanomeshes (GNMs) as a function of material density, pore morphology, pore edge passivation, and the lattice arrangement of the nanomesh pores. Relations for the density dependence of the GNMs’ thermal conductivity are established. For GNMs with circular pores, we find that the thermal conductivity is an exponential function of the GNM’s neck width with a very weak dependence on the pore lattice structure and pore edge passivation. For GNMs with elliptical pores, the thermal conductivity becomes anisotropic and this anisotropy becomes stronger with decreasing GNM density. CV 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

I. INTRODUCTION
Graphene has remarkable mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties,1–3 which can be tuned by properly modifying graphene structure and composition through patterning and chemical functionalization.4–8 The thermal conductivity of graphene is particularly remarkable, with reported values for single-layer graphene ranging from 2000 to 6000 W/Km along the in-plane directions.7,9 In graphene that contains defects, the thermal conductivity decreases significantly even for a small concentration of defects.10,11 However, systematic defect engineering of graphene can be used to precisely tune its thermal properties. Toward this end, graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), narrow strips of graphene with nm-scale widths, have thermal conductivity that is strongly dependent on the ribbon width, edge roughness, and hydrogen termination.12,13 Graphene nanomeshes (GNMs) are defect-engineered graphene nanostructures (also known as graphene antidots) consisting of a periodic arrangement of nano-scale holes or pores in the graphene lattice with neck widths less than 10 nm, mimicking dense arrays of ordered nanoribbons.14 GNMs have significant potential for property tuning by defect engineering due to the possibility of controlling pore size and arrangement and material density. For example, the elastic modulus of GNMs with circular pores scales with the square of the material density.15 The thermal expansion of GNMs also exhibits an interesting trend: under thermal excitation, while the whole structure contracts (expands), the nanoholes expand (contract).16 The purpose of this article is to establish relations for the thermal transport properties of GNMs as a function of the various parameters that fully define the nanomesh structure and architecture. We conduct a systematic and comprehensive parametric study of the thermal conductivity of GNMs based on atomistic simulations according to reliable many-body interatomic potentials. We derive scaling laws for the dependence of the GNMs’ thermal conductivity on their density for various nanomesh architectures characterized by different pore
lattice arrangements and pore sizes and determine the effects of pore morphology and pore edge passivation on such thermal conductivity-density relations. We find a dramatic reduction of the thermal conductivity of low-density GNMs with respect to that of perfect, pristine single-layer graphene, which implies that GNMs characterized by narrow (a few nm) neck widths may have significant potential as two-dimensional (2D) thermoelectric materials. The rest of the article is structured as follows. The key GNM parameters of interest to this study, as well as the computational methods implemented in our study for the determination of thermal conductivity are discussed in Sec. II. Our findings for the thermal conductivity of GNMs and its dependence on the GNM density and architectural parameters are presented and discussed in Sec. III. Finally, the main conclusions of our study are summarized in Sec. IV.
II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
In this study, in a manner analogous with the study of Ref. 15, we constructed GNMs by introducing circular or elliptical pores in regular periodic arrangements (pore lattices) in single-layer graphene, as depicted in Fig. 1. We have examined hexagonal, square, and honeycomb pore lattices in order to consider any effects of GNM architecture. The center-to-center distance between neighboring pores, L, was fixed at 24 C-C bond lengths. In GNMs with circular pores, as shown in Fig. 1(a), we controlled the pore size by setting the pore radius, R. Since L 1⁄4 h þ 2R, controlling the pore radius also controls the GNM pore width, h, which is defined as the minimum distance between neighboring pore edges. In GNMs with elliptical pores of semi-major and semi-minor (principal) axes Ry and Rx, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(b), we controlled the pore size by setting Ry and the aspect ratio f  Ry=Rx. Again, controlling pore size also controls h, since L 1⁄4 h þ 2Ry 1⁄4 h þ 2fRx. In turn, controlling h controls the material density q. In GNMs with circular pores,
h=L  h~ 1⁄4 1  ð2pffi3ffiffi=pÞ1=2ð1  q~Þ1=2, where ~q  q=q0 with q0 being the normal density of perfect, pristine single-layer graphene and ð1  q~Þ is a metric of the GNM’s porosity. An analogous geometrical relation between neck width h and GNM density q also holds for GNMs with elliptical pores.

We used non-equilibrium molecular-dynamics (NEMD) simulations to compute the thermal conductivity of the GNMs. In all the simulations, one thin ribbon of carbon atoms at each end of the GNM was fixed to prevent atoms from sublimating. These two ends of the supercell were used to define the direction of an applied temperature gradient with periodic boundary conditions used in the other direction. The interatomic interactions were described by the adaptive interatomic reactive empirical bond-order (AIREBO) potential.17 It should be noted that using bondorder (REBO-type) interatomic potentials typically leads to underestimation of the thermal conductivity of graphene;18,19 this is because such interatomic potentials yield suppressed phonon dispersion relations, which results in underestimating group velocities as compared to the experimental values. However, in spite of discrepancies in detailed quantitative predictions, AIREBO is sufficiently accurate to predict correct qualitative trends in the dependence of thermal conductivity on material density and material structural features. The LAMMPS molecular-dynamics program20 was used to perform the simulations with a time step of 1 fs employed in the integration of the classical equations of motion. In the first stage of the simulations, we equilibrated the material system for 200 ps at constant volume and a temperature of 300 K using the Nose-Hoover thermostat. After equilibration, we turned off the global thermostat and generated a constant-rate heat source at one end of the GNM supercell and removed the heat at the same rate at the other end of the supercell using velocity rescaling. In the simulations, the hot and cold reservoirs were about 1.2 nm wide containing about 500 atoms. A heat rate (power) ranging from 108 to 5  107 W was applied depending on the details of the GNM configuration; in the computations, we chose d 1⁄4 0.335 nm as the GNMs’ thickness. After about 2–5 ns, a steady state was reached and the temperature profiles along the GNM were calculated and averaged over 5–10 ns, depending on the system size. After a steady state was established, we monitored the time-averaged temperature profiles and computed the corresponding temperature gradients from which we can evaluate the thermal conductivity of the GNM using Fourier’s law,
JQ 1⁄4 krT: (1)
In Eq. (1), JQ is the heat flux, k is the thermal conductivity assuming isotropic heat conduction, T is the temperature field, and rT is the temperature gradient. For a temperature gradient directed along the x-axis of a Cartesian frame of reference, Eq. (1) can be simplified to give for the magnitude of the heat flux, JQ, the expression JQ 1⁄4 kdT=dx. To limit the size of the simulation cell and render the NEMD simulations computationally tractable, a scaling procedure was employed where the thermal conductivity is determined for several lengths of the simulation cell along the heat-flux direction.21 In our simulations, we calculated the thermal conductivity of GNMs with different supercell lengths, Lc 1⁄4 47.2, 94.4, 141.6, 188.8, and 377.6 nm. Then, the inverse of the thermal conductivity, 1/k, was plotted as a function of the inverse of the simulation cell length, 1/Lc, and the “bulk” thermal conductivity was determined by extrapolating the data to the 1/Lc ! 0 limit. We found that for low-density GNMs, the computed thermal conductivity is independent of Lc; for mid-density GNMs, the computed thermal conductivity converges with increasing Lc; however, for higher-density GNMs, the thermal conductivity does not converge due to the long phonon mean free path and the reported thermal conductivity values are the extrapolated ones according to the above scaling procedure. In all the simulations of GNMs with circular pores, the GNM supercell width was 13.6 nm. In all the simulations of GNMs with elliptical pores with major axes along the armchair (y) direction and the zigzag (x) direction, the GNM supercell width was 13.6 nm and 11.8 nm, respectively. We found that the calculated thermal conductivity values remain practically the same after doubling the width of GNM supercells from the above values at fixed supercell length. Thus, in all of our simulations that yielded the reported k values, the width of the GNM supercells were kept at 13.6 nm or 11.8 nm as described above. Recent studies have reported that the thermal conductivity of low-dimensional materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, is length-dependent;22,23 however, several studies also have shown that the thermal transport

properties of these materials are sensitive to defects, and in the presence of such defects, the dependence of the thermal conductivity on length is not as strong as in pristine CNTs and graphene.24–26 Figure 2(a) shows a schematic representation of the NEMD simulation setup for computing the thermal conductivity of the GNMs. A few layers of carbon atoms are held fixed at both ends of the GNMs and a constant heat flux is generated in the direction marked by the arrow. A typical temperature profile, obtained after steady state is established, is shown in Fig. 2(b). The temperature profile is linear, which validates Fourier’s law of heat conduction for the GNMs investigated. Figure 2(c) shows the system size dependence of the computed thermal conductivity, where k is plotted as a function of Lc for the highestdensity GNMs examined in this study. For these GNMs, k is not converged with the system lengths employed in the simulations. Therefore, the scaling procedure described above was implemented, which is highlighted in Fig. 2(d).
III. THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF GNMs AND DEPENDENCE ON NANOMESH PARAMETERS
Figure 3 shows the results of our NEMD simulations for the dependence of the thermal conductivity k on the neck width, h, for GNMs with circular pores arranged in a hexagonal lattice with (open circles) and without (open squares) hydrogen passivation of the pore edges. The corresponding
solid curves in the main plot represent the optimal exponential fits to the data. The excellent fits imply that the thermal conductivity-density relations of the GNMs obey the scaling

law k=k0  eh=t, where k0 1⁄4 5000 W/mK is the thermal conductivity of perfect, pristine single-layer graphene and t  L is a thickness scale. This scaling law implies that lnðk=k0Þ  h~ and, given the h(q) geometrical relation, that lnðk=k0Þ 
ð1  q~Þ1=2 with the logarithm of the conductivity decreasing with increasing porosity ð1  q~Þ. This k(h) dependence is extremely strong and may hold the key to engineering 2D thermoelectric materials. This k(h) or k(q) dependence differs from the dependence of the thermal conductivity of GNRs on the width of the GNR; the GNR thermal conductivity increases linearly with the GNR width and saturates when the GNR width exceeds 10 nm.12 The inset of Fig. 3 gives a semi(natural)log plot of the computed GNM thermal conductivity as a function of the square root of the GNM porosity with the straight lines representing optimal linear fits to the simulation results; the very good linear fits confirm further the above scaling law. From the results of Fig. 3, it is also evident that the thermal conductivity of GNMs has a very weak dependence on the pore edge passivation. For GNMs with small neck widths (0.5–2 nm), the thermal conductivity is slightly higher if the pore edge is passivated. This finding also differs from that of the GNR thermal conductivity dependence on edge passivation, where edge passivation significantly lowers the thermal conductivity.12 We attribute both differences, in the neck/ribbon width and edge passivation dependence of the thermal conductivity, between GNMs and GNRs to the underlying phonon scattering mechanisms in the two material systems. In GNRs, phonon scattering is mediated partly by phonon-phonon scattering (Umklapp processes) and partly by phonon-edge scattering; while in GNMs, due to the narrow neck widths, phonon-edge scattering becomes the dominant phonon scattering mechanism. Changing the neck width in GNMs affects greatly the edge curvature that plays a role analogous to that of edge roughness in GNRs, which causes a strong (exponential) k dependence on h. The significant reduction of the phonon mean free path by changing the GNM’s pore edge curvature weakens its dependence on the GNM’s pore edge passivation. Figure 4 shows the results of our NEMD simulations for the density (q/q0) dependence of the thermal conductivity k for GNMs with circular pores arranged in hexagonal (open squares), honeycomb (open circles), and square (open triangles) lattices without any pore edge passivation. For all lattice arrangements, there is a dramatic decrease in the thermal conductivity as the GNM density decreases, which is quantitatively consistent with the k(q) relation established by the results of Fig. 3, as highlighted by the semi-(natural)log plot in the inset in Fig. 4 as a function of the square root of the GNM porosity and the corresponding excellent linear fits. Nevertheless, the corresponding three data sets practically overlap, which indicates that the GNM k(q) relation has a very weak dependence on the pore lattice structure (GNM architecture). This weak effect of the GNM architecture also is highlighted further by comparing the three data sets in the inset in Fig. 4. These findings also are consistent with our findings about the weak dependence of the GNMs’ elastic modulusdensity relations on the GNMs’ pore lattice structure.15 Heat conduction in crystalline solids is, in general, anisotropic. The structure of GNMs with elliptical pores
generates preferred directions for heat conduction. In this case, we generalize Eq. (1) to

with x and y being the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. In Eq. (2), k is a transversely isotropic tensor in 2D with zero off-diagonal elements and nonzero diagonal elements kxx 61⁄4 kyy. Our simulation results for the density dependence of the thermal conductivity components kxx and kyy for GNMs with elliptical pores of aspect ratios f 1⁄4 1, 3/2, and 2 are shown in Fig. 5 in a semi-(natural)log plot as a function of the square root of the GNM porosity with straight lines corresponding to the optimal linear fits for each data set. For circular pores, f 1⁄4 1, there is no preference in heat conduction along x or y, and the thermal conductivity tensor of the GNM is isotropic, yielding kxx 1⁄4 kyy 1⁄4 k. However, for elliptical pores, f > 1, the thermal conductivity of the GNM is anisotropic, yielding kxx 61⁄4 kyy. It is evident from the results of Fig. 5 that the two thermal conductivity components obey distinct scaling laws, kxx  eh=tx and kyy  eh=ty with scaling exponents tx 61⁄4 ty. For the GNMs examined with f 1⁄4 Ry=Rx > 1, tx > ty resulting in kxx > kyy, as well as weaker conductivity dependence on the GNM porosity for heat conduction along x than along y. From the results of Fig. 5, it is also evident that the strength of the anisotropy, measured by jkxx - kyyj or kxx/kyy increases with increasing aspect ratio f.

conductivity k on the nanomesh density q, pore morphology, pore lattice structure, and pore edge passivation. We found that, for given density and pore morphology, the thermal conductivity is practically independent of pore lattice arrangement and pore edge passivation with H atoms and established thermal conductivity-density relationships. We found that k is an exponential function of the graphene nanomesh neck width h, a very strong dependence that leads to very low k values with respect to that of perfect, pristine single-layer graphene for narrow neck widths, which can be exploited in technological applications. For elliptical pores with aspect ratio f > 1, the thermal conductivity of the nanomeshes follows the same exponential scaling law but becomes anisotropic, with the anisotropy becoming stronger with increasing values of f. We attribute the very weak effect of passivating the nanomesh pore edges on the thermal conductivity of the GNMs to the relatively narrow neck widths of the GNMs examined in our simulations. Stronger effects of the nanomesh pore edge passivation on the thermal conductivity are expected for GNMs with larger neck widths (close to 10 nm). Most importantly, our findings for the k(q) relations emphasize the strong dependence of the GNMs’ thermal conductivity on the GNMs’ density (or neck width) and highlight the potential thermal management applications of these patterned nanoporous 2D functional materials. Moreover, consistent with previous studies,4,23 our findings further emphasize the strong dependence of the thermal
conductivity of graphene-based materials on structural features and intrinsic length scales in these materials.
