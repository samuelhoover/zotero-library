ABSTRACT
Building upon the OPLS3 force field we report on an enhanced model, OPLS3e, that further
extends its coverage of medicinally relevant chemical space by addressing limitations in
chemotype transferability. OPLS3e accomplishes this by incorporating new parameter types that
recognize moieties with greater chemical specificity and integrating an on-the-fly parameterization
approach to the assignment of partial charges. As a consequence, OPLS3e leads to greater
accuracy against performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities,
solvation and protein-ligand binding.

I. Introduction
Free energy approaches that utilize all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are emerging
as a powerful tool in the design of new molecules and materials. Spurring interest in these methods
is the promise of a high degree of predictive accuracy owing to the physical rigor with which these
methods account for the composite atomistic and configurational complexity of molecular
systems. In principle, their accuracy is only limited by the ability to achieve adequate phase space
sampling and by the veracity of the model potential. Because of their speed, the class of
approximate molecular models commonly referred to as force fields offer a tractable means for
applying free energy methods to the study of phenomena in complex biological and materials
systems. A notable example is the application of free energy perturbation theory (FEP) to calculate
ligand binding potencies in structure-based drug discovery projects.1-5 The adoption of this
technology in active projects is gaining traction as advances to the technology result in greater
automation, delivering more robust results with greater expediency.6-11 As the capacity of the
technology continues to improve and sees greater usage on a wider regime of systems it is
imperative that the development of the force field continues apace to ensure meaningful and
predictive results.
Force fields aim to strike a balance between computational expediency and physical
salience and accomplish this goal by employing simple potential functions, such as, harmonic
terms to represent bond vibrations and fixed-point charges to approximate electrostatic
interactions.12-13 These terms depend explicitly upon sets of empirically determined parameters
tuned to reproduce pertinent physical properties. Target parameterization data is typically
comprised of quantum mechanical and experimental data for representative and diverse small
organic molecules. To be effective, a force field needs to provide an accurate parameterization of


3
all components of the system that can impact a property of interest. For ligand-protein binding, a
particularly noteworthy challenge is the development of a force field that achieves a uniformly
high level of accuracy (on the order of 1 kcal/mol) over the many diverse chemistries found within
drug-like molecules. Early efforts to build force fields for drug-like small molecules have tended
to focus on parameter generalization.14-17 That is, automating the process by which a set of existing
parameters can be translated into assignments for any arbitrary ligand. Less effort has been placed
on building the extensive basis of parameters needed to cover drug-like chemical space at a high
level of accuracy. The recent development of OPLS318 represents perhaps the largest concerted
parameterization effort aimed at traversing this space and it forms the starting point for the work
discussed herein. To review, notable features of the OPLS3 model include:
1. An improved protein force field.
2. Extensive parameterization of valence and torsional terms found in drug-like
molecules supplemented by an automated version of the fitting protocol
(FFBuilder) used to fill coverage gaps.
3. Improvements to the charge model including virtual (off-atom centered) sites to
better represent lone pair and sigma hole charge distributions.
These advances translated to significant improvements in protein-ligand binding accuracy using
FEP. Relative to OPLS2005, OPLS3 resulted in a 30% improvement in aggregate RMS error.
Despite these gains, the current prediction error continues to exceed the expected experimental
uncertainties by a significant margin, indicating additional room for improvement in the
technology remains.
The aim of the work presented herein is to address additional outstanding sources of force
field error that contribute significantly to the residual FEP error. In particular, we’ve found that


4
sub-optimal parameter transferability across shared chemotypes impacting both the torsion and
partial charge parameterizations can significantly impact FEP accuracy. To address this, a new
version of the force field, OPLS3e, has been developed. Notable improvements include:
• A more accurate and transferable torsional parameterization via an extensive
optimization of torsion types.
• Integration of a ligand-specific, on-the-fly partial charge assignment approach.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present two representative cases that
illustrate the source of force field error resulting in significant binding free energy mispredictions.
Section 3 discusses the OPLS3e development. Part 3.A provides a brief overview, Part 3.B
presents the new torsion model including the process of refining torsion types, the extended data
sets that were required to train the model and the performance on conformational energy
benchmarks. Part 3.C presents the new charge assignment method and also includes a discussion
of the simple condensed phase data sets used to develop and validate the model. In Section 4 we
discuss the protein-ligand binding validation. This data set includes a significant extension from
previous reports,1, 18 with new ligand and receptor data collected with the expressed aim of
presenting challenging chemotype transferability cases for the force field. Section 5 then
summarizes the results and discusses future directions.
II. OPLS3 Force Field Outliers
Suboptimal assignment of torsion and partial charge parameters can lead to erroneous free
energy calculations. Panel A of Figure 1 shows an example of an FEP+ misprediction that arose
in a drug discovery program that was due to sub-optimal torsion parameters (only details that
directly pertain to the outlier investigation are presented). The ligands differ by a replacement of


5
an amide substituent with an ester. Experimentally, the relative binding free energy of the ligands
is approximately zero. However, the OPLS3-based FEP+ prediction significantly underestimates
the amide-pyrrole binding free energy relative to the ester. An indicator of the underlying model
issue driving the erroneous prediction is shown in Panel B. The top fragment represents the
substructure of the amide-pyrrole ligand in the FEP calculation. The plot contrasts the associated
QM and MM potential energy scanning the dihedral angle connecting the amide substituent to the
pyrrole ring defined by the NCcn atoms (aromatic atoms in lower case). The predominant rotamer
state in solution corresponds to an NCcn angle ~ 0. The predominant state in the complex
corresponds to an NCcn angle ~ 180 which brings the NH of the amide and pyrrole into close
proximity facilitating a bidentate contact with a nearby histidine. As such, to adopt the bioactive
conformation, the amide-pyrrole derivative needs to pay some degree of conformational work.
Based on the potential energy comparison to QM, OPLS3 appears to significantly overestimate
this contribution consistent with the observed under-predicted affinity. To verify this hypothesis,
we re-ran the binding experiment with a slight modification to OPLS3 (denoted OPLS3*) where
the amide-pyrrole torsion of 2-amide-3 methyl pyrrole is re-fit to match QM. The associated
relative amide-to-ester free energy of OPLS3* is -0.23 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with
experiment.
To explain why OPLS3 errs in matching QM for this dihedral, the training set molecule
used to fit the OPLS3 amide-pyrrole dihedral, is shown in panel B of Figure 1 (bottom fragment).
Though chemically similar to the ligand substructure of interest, the training set molecule does
contain two crucial differences that ultimately result in poor quantitative parameter transferability
to the moiety of interest. The pyrrole nitrogen is capped by a methyl group instead of hydrogen
and the training set molecule lacks an additional ortho-methyl group. Because both features lie


6
one bond away from the atoms used to define the OPLS3 torsion, the same parameters are assigned
to both motifs. The modified version of the force field, OPLS3*, which was trained to the 2
amide-3-pyrrole fragment, shows a similar level of error when applied to the OPLS3 training set
molecule, further illustrating that a common set of parameters can’t reconcile the energetics of
both moieties. To resolve this incompatibility issue, the assignment algorithm would need to
distinguish between these motifs by taking into account an extended chemical regime that includes
these ortho positioned features.
Additional examples emerged following a similar theme: differences in chemistry
unaccounted for by the assigned torsion parameter type lead to sub-optimal energetic
transferability to a moiety of interest resulting in an FEP+ mis-prediction. However, the chemical
features driving these errors varied from case to case. In an effort to identify and minimize
instances like this, in future applications, we set out to systematically refine the chemical basis that
defines torsion parameter types to better delineate groups that necessitate distinct parameter
assignments. In section 3 we discuss that effort.
Our second example illustrates an FEP+ misprediction due to sub-optimal assignment of
partial charges. We observed poor predictive performance using OPLS3 over a set of inhibitors
with cyclic amidine and guanidine cores binding to the two catalytic aspartates of Bace-1.19, 20 As
shown in Figure 2, the predicted binding free energy for replacing an aromatic carbon for a
nitrogen (aza derivatives) in the amino-isoindole core is underestimated by 3-4 kcal/mol. After
reviewing the parameters assigned to the amidine motif we noticed that the partial charges of the
amino-aza-isoindole cores differ significantly and consistently from those of the amino-isoindole
cores, especially for the amidinium atoms HNC marked in the Figure. We validated this error
hypothesis by fitting QM charges to the ligands directly following the “OPLS3+QMcharges”


7
method outlined in Section 3C. The fitted partial charges of the amidine motif are in qualitative
agreement with the OPLS3 charges for the amino-isoindole core, and consistent for the aza
derivatives. The FEP+ predicted free energy using OPLS3 with these QM fitted charges leads to
good agreement with experiment (Figure 2).20
The reason for this OPLS3 error follows from dependencies of the method on the
composition of the training set. OPLS3 employs a CM1A-BCC based charge model that combines
Cramer-Truhlar CM1A charges21 with specifically fit bond charge correction terms (BCC). The
BCC corrections are primarily fit to QM electrostatic potentials (ESP) (using HF/6-31G*) but also
include additional refinements against experimental solvation free energies22. These BCCs in turn
depend on the molecule composition of this training set. The OPLS3 training set includes the
bicyclic core of compound 11. However, the associated aza derivatives are not part of the OPLS3
training set and the BCCs assigned to the cores in compound 13 and 16 instead fall back to
parameters based on the next best available match. In this case, the next best match is a
combination of pyridine and acyclic amidine which transfers poorly to the fused ring substructure
of interest.
The example illustrates a general need for better equipping the charge model when it
encounters ligand substructures that lie outside the force field training set. To address this, we
develop a ligand-level charge model that assigns partial charges for each new compound based on
a combination of fitting to QM derived ESP and restraints to OPLS3 and describe a framework
that can easily be further updated in the future.
III. OPLS3e Developments
A. Overview


8
The functional form of the force field and the development of bond stretching, angle bending
and van der Waals parameters is discussed in the OPLS3 reporting publication18 and remains
unchanged in OPLS3e. Changes with respect to OPLS3 include revisions to the small molecule
torsional and charge potentials covered in parts B and C, below.
B. Refined Torsion Types
Torsional parameters are needed to describe the quantum mechanical effects associated with
stereoelectronic effects and resonance structures. They play a critical role in determining molecule
conformational energies which sensitively impacts protein-ligand binding by modulating the
conformational work needed for a ligand to adopt its bioactive conformation.23 In OPLS3e, this
component of the potential is represented by the same truncated Fourier series described previously
(see eq 1 in reference 18) where the associated V1-4 parameters are determined for each torsion
type by fitting to model molecule quantum chemical torsion energy profiles.
The profiles were generated as follows: 1. Force field-based torsion scans (in 30 degree
increments) are developed from low energy conformers and used as the starting geometries in a
subsequent QM optimization. 2. The quantum chemical profile is resolved via restrained
optimization of the molecules at the B3LYP/6-31G* level for each discretized value of the dihedral
angle. 3. Single point M06-2X/cc-pVTZ(-f) calculations are used to resolve the reference energy
surface. This represents a change in the QM level used relative to earlier work, which was
motivated by a benchmark comparison of various QM methods relative to CCSD(T)/CBS,
summarized in Table S1. This level is used in the fitting of all OPLS3e small molecule torsions
and is QM reference for all subsequent force field comparisons reported in the paper.
The most significant change from OPLS3 is in the definition of the constituent torsion types.
Motivated by erroneous calculations similar to the example discussed in Section 2, we set out to


9
further optimize the type definitions to improve the recognition of chemical environments that
should be treated as distinct. Our approach can be summarized as follows:
1. for each OPLS3 dihedral of interest, identify additional model molecules that share the
same torsion types but differ in their chemical composition;
2. develop associated quantum chemical torsion profiles for the set of molecules;
3. test parameter transferability by training to one member of the molecule set and assessing
the accuracy relative to QM for the other molecules;
4. identify the distinguishing chemical features that lead to a significant loss in accuracy;
5. revise the torsion type definitions to encapsulate the new chemical features; and
6. refit the model with the new basis of torsion types.
An example illustrating this process is summarized in Table 1. Here, the dihedral of interest
is the amino rotation of dimethyl aniline. For OPLS3, the training set molecule is the otherwise
unsubstituted phenyl derivative. The test set includes para substituted methyl, fluoro, chloro,
amino, hydroxyl, enolate, nitrile and phenyl. The parameter transferability quality is indicated
by the root mean square error with respect to QM, over the rotamer energy surface, provided for
each fragment. Good transferability is seen for para-methyl, chloro and phenyl derivatives,
where the substituents have little impact on the QM barrier to rotation. The π-electron fluoro,
amino, hydroxyl and enolate donors significantly weaken the QM barrier to rotation. The nitrile
derivative, which is a π-electron acceptor, significantly strengthens the QM barrier to rotation.
The trend is consistent with previous spectroscopic studies.24 The impact these substituents have
on the conjugation properties of the torsion in question is not captured by the force field leading
to a significant drop in accuracy for these groups. To address this limitation, OPLS3e
encapsulates this information by delineating its parameter assignment based on the presence of


10
the particular para substituents that significantly impact transferability. As a consequence,
OPLS3e achieves a RMS error no greater than 0.3 kcal/mol for this data set. To the 11,845
fragment molecule torsional profiles that constitute the OPLS3 training set18 we added an
additional 11,161 fragment profiles to conduct similar parameter transferability tests.
In total, the parameter type refinements made in OPLS3e encompass variations along 4 main
chemical classes: heteroatom composition, ortho substituents, exocyclic and meta/para
substituents. Figure 3, shows a representative pair of molecules for each class, with their
associated rotamer energies. Where in OPLS3, the indicated dihedral parameters are shared for
each pair, OPLS3e now treats each moiety as distinct. One consequence of refining the definition
of torsion types to be more chemotype specific is that it impacts to what extent chemical
substructures will be fully covered by pre-defined well parameterized OPLS3e torsion types. In
Harder et al. we estimated that the fraction of torsional bonds found in drug-like molecules that
would match existing trained OPLS3 torsion types was 93%. At this stage of the OPLS3e
development that estimate dropped to 68%. To recover a comparable level of statistical coverage
an additional 19,558 torsional profiles, for model molecules with missing coverage, were
resolved and fit using OPLS3e. That is 30,719 more torsional rotamer sets than what we used
for developing OPLS3. The concomitant refinements resulted in a total of 146,669 torsion types
compared to the 48,142 types in OPLS3. And, as with OPLS3, we provide an automated version
of our fitting protocol (FFBuilder) that can be used to fill in outstanding gaps in OPLS3e
coverage.
Table 2 contrasts the rotamer energy RMS error for OPLS2005, OPLS3 and OPLS3e. The
comparison excludes molecules whose constituent torsion types are not presently covered by
OPLS3. The evaluation is split by molecules used to train and test OPLS3e. Though OPLS3


11
(RMSE~1 kcal/mol) performed significantly better than its older counterpart, OPLS2005
(RMSE~2 kcal/mol) the new OPLS3e parameterization performs significantly better
(RMSE~0.5 kcal/mol).
C. Ligand-Based On-the-Fly Charge Model
The OPLS3e charge model retains the same Coulombic fixed charge functional form utilized by
OPLS3. Additional virtual (off-atom centered) sites for aromatic ring nitrogens and aryl halogens
(excluding fluorine) that were added to OPLS3 are retained in OPLS3e. The difference with
respect to OPLS3 is in the method used to assign partial charges. As discussed in Section 2,
OPLS3 employs a CM1A-BCC scheme that depends on a set of pre-tabulated bond charge
corrections predominantly fit to recapitulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential of 11,845 model
compounds with additional refinements against solvation free energies. In general, this model has
demonstrated an acceptable level of accuracy when applied to molecules that lie outside its training
set..6-11, 18 However, as evidenced by the Bace-1 outlier shown in Section 2, application to untrained
heterocycles can prove to be problematic.
Two approaches that could be applied to ameliorate this issue are: (1) extend the BCC training
set to include a growing list of heterocycles25 or (2) parameterize the partial charges for each new
ligand by fitting directly to the target QM data (i.e. HF/6-31G* ESP’s) on-the-fly. Option (1) is
akin to the approach taken in refining the torsion model. For charges, however, we expect this
route to present a greater challenge owing to the expansive nature of drug-like chemical space and
the particular sensitivity of charges to their chemical environment. Because the on-the-fly method
maximally encapsulates all the pertinent chemical information of the constituent ligands, we’ve
chosen to focus on this approach. One potential downside is that the compute time required to


12
generate the QM ESP can be prohibitive for certain FF-based applications such as virtual screening
or small molecule conformational search. However, for MD based applications, such as FEP, the
requisite assignment time (~10 min) remains small relative to the time required for the production
simulations.
Though HF/6-31G* based charges, in general, perform well when combined with the OPLS
force field, there are a limited set of known chemical moieties where QM based charge fitting does
not translate well to the condensed phase.26 In OPLS3, this was addressed by additional refinement
of BCC parameters against available condensed phase data.22 To retain these refinements in
OPLS3e we use a restrained QM fitting approach, where the reference values are based on OPLS3
charges and the strength of the restraints can vary by chemical substructure. In principal, this
would allow the model to hew more closely to this reference for moieties that required additional
refinements and adapt more freely to QM, otherwise. The restraint values are developed and
validated against a set of small molecule experimental hydration and transfer free energies. The
hydration free energy data set is comprised of the Shivakumar et al.22 set of 240 molecules, as well
as an additional 178 molecules from the FreeSolv database27 selected to cover a variation of
chemical groups while excluding larger compounds with multiple rotatable bonds. Applying the
same selection criteria, we further expanded our validation sets to include a sub-set of water
toluene and water-chloroform transfer free energies from references 28-30. FEP+ solvation free
energies were calculated by annihilation of the compound from solvent. Simulations times were
4ns, charge and van der Waals perturbations were run sequentially and transfer free energies were
calculated as the difference between annihilation free energies in water and in chloroform/toluene
respectively.


13
As a baseline, we explored a charge model with zero restraints to reference values (OPLS3 using
QM charges). Results for these solvation free energy benchmarks are shown in Table 3. The error
of the hydration free energy benchmark was observed to be significantly worse using this model
versus standard OPLS3 (1.39 kcal/mol versus 1.02 kcal/mol). Upon closer inspection, the
regression was concentrated in the following functional groups (see Table 4): amines,
formates/esters, nitros and the indicated sulfur derivatives. Representative fragments for these
groups are shown in Figure S1. Amines present a well-known issue where the QM ESP derived
partial charges fail to describe the trend in solvation energies of primary, secondary and tertiary
amines.26 As discussed previously, OPLS3 has addressed this by further refining parameters
against additional condensed phase data.
After iterative empirical testing against condensed phase benchmarks we settled on a two-tier
restraint scheme, with a relatively large restraint for the functional groups mentioned above and a
relatively small restraint for everything else. Including low restraints helps ameliorate the
problems that the partial charges can suffer from the underdetermined nature of fitting to ESP’s
for ligand sized molecules31 and ensure physically relevant charges (e.g. non-negative hydrogens).
The hybrid model, OPLS3e, compares well to OPLS3 for hydration free energies and shows a
marked improvement in the transfer free energy benchmarks (Table 3). In particular, the chemical
groups identified as problematic to describe with an unrestricted fit to the QM ESP are well
described in OPLS3e (Table 4). It is important to emphasize here that this scheme is predicated
on a posteriori knowledge of (and the availability of adequate existing parameters for) the set of
moieties where QM electrostatic potential fitting leads to poor transferability to the condensed
phase. This list of moieties will require revision if, with the acquisition of new experimental data,
additional chemistries are identified that show a similar lack of transferability.


14
We need to further address the preparation of the molecular conformation used to fit the partial
charges. Because fixed charge models do not explicitly account for intramolecular polarization
effects, their charge parameters will depend on the particular conformation(s) used when fitting to
the QM ESP. This is especially pertinent for ligand sized molecules in a FEP+ like context. Here
we employ the putative bioactive conformation used in the FEP calculation. As an alternative, we
also attempted an extended conformation (employed by OPLS3 to calculate CM1A charges)22 but
found better performance using the bioactive conformation. As an initial step before fitting
charges, the given input molecule geometries are pre-minimized with a torsional constraint, to
preserve the initially provided conformation while avoiding strain. In principal, systems where
this fixed charge approach results in parameters that are incongruous with other pertinent ligand
conformations (eg. in water solvent) would necessitate an electrostatic treatment that explicitly
accounts for these polarization effects.32,33 However, we note that in the FEP+ systems studied in
the present work we did not observe significant errors as a consequence of the present
approximation.
IV. Application to Protein-Ligand Binding
In reference 18, we used a large data set of protein-ligand binding FEP calculations to assess the
impact of improvements made to the force field. Comparing OPLS3 to earlier variants of OPLS
we observed a significant systematic reduction in FEP RMS error with improvements to the quality
of the force field. Here we aim to do the same comparison for OPLS3e and OPLS3.
The data set includes the 8 systems originally reported in reference 1. We also collected
additional test series designed to more stringently probe challenging chemical transformations akin
to the outlier cases presented in Section 2. The class of perturbations most commonly associated


15
with both the charge and torsion transferability issues discussed involved changes in composition
of conjugated ring systems. This addition includes the Chk1, Bace and FXa series first presented
in Harder et al. Additional ligand series were sourced for FXa from references 34-37,, Bace from
reference 38 and another series focused on changes to an amidinium core, coordinating the
catalytic aspartates of Bace in reference 19, excluding compounds with uncertain protonation state
or multiple possible tautomeric states. A representative ligand for each target is shown in Figure
4. Additional data sets, representing a similar chemistry focus, was sourced from Schrodinger
collaboration projects, denoted project A, B, C and D in Table 5. In total 194 additional ligands
were added to the original 199 ligand benchmark. The final combined data set includes various
targets and compounds, including examples of kinases, proteases, tyrosine phosphatase, peptidase,
positive/negative/neutral ligands, and variations of both cores and R-groups.
The FEP+ protocol was similar to that previously described in reference 1, with a few notable
differences. All simulations were run for 25ns, instead of 5ns, to improve convergence and enable
us to focus on force field related differences. For P38, an incomplete loop was modeled in. For
FXa, after close inspection of crystal structure densities, we noticed an ion binding site close to
the ligand which was previously assigned as water.34, 36, 37 Consistent with the reported assay
conditions, we replaced this water with a sodium ion.35, 37 We also refined ligand starting
geometries using a similar strategy to that discussed in reference 39. When there was ambiguity
about the pose, such as for symmetric R-groups with meta or ortho substituents that could flip 180
degrees, we used FEP+ to assess and select the pose with the lowest free energy. Starting pose
coordinates for ligands and proteins can be found in supplementary material. Associated PDB
codes are provided in Table S2.


16
The overall RMS error is improved by approximately 20% with OPLS3e. That improvement is
primarily driven by accuracy improvement in the extended test series. On the original FEP+
benchmark (rows 1-8), both OPLS3 and OPLS3e perform similarly well. The series that sees the
greatest improvement using OPLS3e is ProjectC (OPLS3 RMSE = 2.2 kcal/mol, OPLS3e RMSE
= 0.9 kcal/mol). The improvement is a product of both the improved torsions and charges. An
example perturbation improved by the OPLS3e torsions is shown in Figure 5. It involves the
breaking of a fused ring system in the core of the molecule leaving a dangling amide substituent.
Experimentally, breaking the fused ring results in a 1.5 kcal/mol loss of potency. In contrast,
OPLS3 predicts a loss of potency of 4.5 kcal/mol. The simulated distribution of the torsion
connecting the amide substituent to the ring shown in the figure indicates the source of the error.
In both OPLS3 and OPLS3e, the predominant state in the complex corresponds to a NCcc angle
of approximately 180 degrees which situates the amide group in the same plane as the parent
heterocycle and facilitates formation of inter-molecule hydrogen bonds with the backbone of the
protein. The same conformation is the primary state sampled by OPLS3e in solution. However,
in OPLS3, the primary state in solution has the plane of the amide group orthogonal to the core
heterocycle (NCcc=90). Thus, the OPLS3 representation incorrectly suggests that this variant will
incur an additional conformational strain upon binding which leads to the observed under
prediction of its affinity versus the experimental reference data.
Consistent with this trend, the QM and OPLS3e energy required to rotate this group to the
NCcc=90 state is approx. 14 kcal/mol. OPLS3 under-estimates this energetic penalty by 7
kcal/mol which leads to the erroneous solvent population observed here. Fixing just the torsion
issues addresses a significant portion of the OPLS3 error over this series. Using a model that
combines OPLS3 charges with OPLS3e torsions reduces the series RMSE from 2.2 kcal/mol to


17
1.5 kcal/mol (Table 6). The remaining improvement in accuracy is due to the improved partial
charge treatment with OPLS3e for the varied heterocyclic systems in this series.
The set of amidine inhibitors of Bace-1 (Bace_cores) is another data set that shows significant
improvement with OPLS3e. The data set includes the outlier case discussed in Section 2 and is
comprised of a set of relatively uncommon heterocyclic cores (Figure 6) that form key interactions
with catalytic aspartates in the binding site. To accurately reflect how these variations modulate
the strength of their interaction with the catalytic aspartates, is a challenge for the force field. The
predictions for this data set are relatively insensitive to the details of the torsion model and are
primarily driven by changes in OPLS3e to the partial charges.
The data set consists of two maps: one covering a series of monocyclic compounds (cmpd 1-10)
and another covering a set of fused bicyclic compounds (cmpd 11-24). For the monocyclic sub
set the RMS error improves from 1.7 kcal/mol with OPLS3 to 1.3 kcal/mol. The basis for the
improvement is subtle and manifested over the full data set, illustrating the benefit of OPLS3e for
novel heterocycle design. For the fused bicyclic subset the RMS error improves from 2.2 kcal/mol
to 1.5 kcal/mol. The improvement is driven by better partial charge modeling of the aza derivatives
in the series. Table 7, gives the binding affinity for each unsubstituted pyridyl and pyrmidyl
derivative in the series relative to the amino-isoindole core (cmpd 11). As discussed in Section 2,
the poor OPLS3 predictions are a product of poor parameter transferability from the OPLS3
training set for the n-aryl substituted compounds. OPLS3e addresses this issue by fitting directly
to QM leading to significantly better performance over this set.
Despite these improvements the RMS error for the Bace_core data set (1.39 kcal/mol) remains
quite high. The remaining outlier, which is mainly responsible for the residual error, is cmpd 23.
As shown in Figure 7, relative to the amino-isoindole core (cmpd 11) cmpd 23 introduces an


18
additional OMe group to the core ring. As indicated in Figure 7, the addition of the OMe
substituent introduces a significant electron rich moiety in close proximity to ASP228 which leads
to a significant drop in potency for cmpd 23. However, both OPLS3 and OPLS3e significantly
over-estimate the associated drop in potency by approx. 3 kcal/mol. In our FEP+ simulations the
two catalytic aspartates in Bace-1 are assumed to be unprotonated in the holo state, in agreement
with previous publications.19, 40 However, given the present observation we conjectured that the
introduction of substituents with significant electronegativity at this position may shift the
preferred state of ASP228 to be neutral. To test this hypothesis, we estimated the pKa of this
residue in the presence of both compounds #11 and #23 to be 4 and 7, respectively. The pKa
protocol is discussed in SI Section 3. Given the associated experimental pH of the assay is 4.5,
this implies that the neutral form of ASP288 should be predominant for cmpd 23. Correcting the
predicted binding affinity of cmpd #23 relative to cmpd #11, using Equation S6, gives +2.0
kcal/mol which is in-line with the experimentally measured value of +2.6 kcal/mol. We are
presently pursuing strategies to include pKa effects, like this, in FEP+ calculations.
Likewise, for the monocyclic molecules the binding affinity of core number 5 is still
overestimated with OPLS3e. All Bace-1 cores in the data set are assumed to have a protonated
amidine motif both in the protein binding site and in the reference state. Experimental core
contribution to pKa is lower for core 5 than the other monocycles.19 The same is true for the
calculated pKa, which for core 5 with two phenyl R-groups is 4.8, close to the assay conditions
of pH=4.5. There is a possibility that core 5 is unprotonated before binding, which would result in
an energetic penalty upon binding, and could explain the too high predicted affinity.


19
In summary, there is still room for improvements, but overall OPLS3e performs well for all
tested systems, and especially contributes a significant improvement to OPLS3 for challenging
heterocycles.
V. Conclusion
We here report the development and validation of a new force field, OPLS3e, that leads to
improved performance in predicting protein-ligand binding affinities. Over an expansive set of
protein targets and ligand chemistries, the model achieves a RMS error of approx. 1 kcal/mol. The
model accomplishes this by addressing limitations in chemotype transferability that affects small
molecule torsions and charges. Better torsion parameter transferability is achieved with an
expanded basis of torsion types that distinguish moieties with greater chemical specificity. Better
charge parameter transferability is achieved by directly fitting ligand specific charges to the target
QM derived electrostatic potential. Ligand transformations that modulate the composition of
conjugated heterocycles are particularly sensitive to these effects and display the most pronounced
accuracy improvements.
With regards to future development, we anticipate that additional parameter refinements to the
present development (eg. adding new torsion types) will be necessary as more reference data
becomes available. We also expect that, as more aggressive explorations of chemical and
configurational space are enabled by continued advances in sampling efficiency, that will, in turn,
expose new challenges to the fidelity of the force field. In addition, we are also actively looking
into accuracy improvements that could be derived from modifications to the functional form of the
model (eg. multi-dimensional dihedral terms, better VdW terms etc.) and improved treatment of
regimes of chemical space that lie outside the present testing data (eg. metalloenzymes). Beyond
improvements to the force field, we are also actively pursuing strategies to account for the impact


20
that changes in protonation state can have in FEP+ calculations. As a basis for prioritizing these
prospective activities, we continue to investigate outstanding prediction outliers to gain insights
into the most important improvements that need to be made.
Figures and Tables
Figure 1. Left panel shows the experimental and FEP-predicted relative binding free energy in
kcal/mol between ligands distinguished by the ester-/amide-pyrrole groups. The right panel shows
the associated potential energy of the NCcn dihedral angle for an amide derivative derived from
the FEP ligand (top) and the molecule used to train the associated torsion parameters (bottom).
The predominant state in the complex corresponds to a NCcn angle=180. The predominant state
in solution corresponds to a NCcn angle=0. OPLS3* is a modified version of OPLS3 that re
parameterizes the amide-pyrrole dihedral against the fragment analog of the amide-pyrrole
substructure present in the left ligand.

Bicyclic core variations with OPLS3/QM amidine charges overlaid shown at right. Table
summarizes the relative experimental and predicted binding free energy of the corresponding full
compounds to Bace-1 in kcal/mol. The amidine motif forms key hydrogen bonds to the two
catalytic aspartates of Bace-1. The predicted binding free energy for replacing one or two aromatic
carbons for nitrogens (13, 16) in the amino-isoindole core (11) is consistently underestimated with
OPLS3. Ligand series are from reference 19, FEP+ calculations employed the 4DJW structure.
