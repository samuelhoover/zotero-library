We study the mechanical behavior and fracture of graphene nanomeshes (GNMs) consisting of hexagonal lattices of unpassivated circular pores based on molecular-dynamics simulations of uniaxial tensile deformation tests. We analyze the GNMs’ mechanical response as a function of their porosity for porosities up to 80%. We find that the fracture strain exhibits a minimum at a porosity 15%, which marks the onset of a transition in the mechanical behavior of the nanomeshes; beyond this critical porosity, the GNM ductility increases and the toughness remains practically constant with increasing porosity. The mechanism of crack initiation and propagation is characterized in both cases of mechanical response. CV 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4905583]
I. INTRODUCTION
Graphene nanomeshes (GNMs) are ordered, defectengineered graphene nanostructures characterized by a periodic arrangement of nanoholes or nanopores in the honeycomb lattice of single-layer graphene with nanometerscale neck widths (<10 nm); such narrow necks make the GNMs resemble dense arrays of nanoribbons, which can render graphene semiconducting by opening a bandgap in its electronic band structure.1 GNMs are prepared commonly using block copolymer lithography and their use in the fabrication of field-effect transistors has resulted in exceptional functionality.1 Recent advances in the synthesis of GNMs and other nanoporous graphene materials have enabled applications in nanoelectronics, electrochemical capacitors, sensors, biological analysis, and separation technologies.2 Theoretical studies have investigated the effects of GNM structural parameters on their electronic properties,3–5 including the opening of a bandgap in the electronic band structure and the tuning of the bandgap by tailoring the GNM porosity and pore lattice symmetry.6–8 The appealing properties of these patterned graphene nanostructures motivate systematic studies for establishing structure-property relationships toward function optimization for numerous technological applications. GNMs can be viewed as prototypical two-dimensional (2D) ordered porous materials; together with crumpled graphene and graphene foam, GNMs have attracted a lot of attention due to their potential applications as a result of their high intrinsic surface area combined with the inherent remarkable electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties of graphene.9,10 Recent theoretical studies have analyzed the elastic response and thermal expansion of GNMs.11,12
Specifically, we have determined the elastic properties of GNMs as a function of the material density, pore lattice arrangement, pore morphology, and pore edge passivation.11 We have found that the elastic modulus scales with the square of the density for GNMs with circular unpassivated pores and examined how this quadratic scaling is influenced by pore morphology, pore edge passivation, and temperature.11 Moreover, the higher-strain mechanical properties of GNMs with square pore lattice arrangements also have been computed.13,14 Nevertheless, in spite of these recent theoretical studies, the high-strain mechanical behavior and fracture of GNMs and how such a structural response to loading depends on the GNM architectural parameters are not fully understood. The purpose of this paper is to understand the mechanical behavior and probe the corresponding structural response and fracture dynamics of GNMs as a function of their architecture and density. Toward this end, we conduct a systematic study of the dynamical response of GNMs to uniaxial tensile straining as a function of their density based on molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations according to reliable many-body interatomic potentials. Our study reveals the onset of a transition in the mechanical response of the nanomeshes at a critical value of GNM density, which guarantees the ductility and toughness of the GNMs over a broad range of porosity, while their strength remains high even at very high porosity. The mechanisms of failure at both low and high porosity in this class of nanomaterials also are characterized in detail. The rest of the article is structured as follows. The main GNM parameters of interest to this study, as well as the computational methods implemented in our study for the analysis of GNM mechanical behavior are described in Sec. II. Our findings for the mechanical response of GNMs under uniaxial straining and the characteristics of their fracture mechanisms at low and high porosity are presented and discussed

in Sec. III. Finally, the main conclusions of our study are summarized in Sec. IV.
II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
In this study, we focus on GNMs that consist of hexagonal lattices of circular pores with unpassivated edges as depicted in Fig. 1. The effects of pore edge passivation and pore morphology are beyond the scope of this work; we expect that varying these nanomesh parameters has quantitative effects on the mechanical properties and fracture dynamics, but not any significant qualitative effects. We expect the most important qualitative effects on the GNM mechanical behavior to arise from varying the material density, q, which is the key parameter explored in the present study. Motivated by the weak (if any) dependence of the GNM elastic properties on the pore lattice structure,11 we did not examine here other pore lattice structures, such as square or honeycomb lattices. We control the pore size by setting the pore radius, R, and the GNM neck width, h, by setting the center-to center distance between neighboring pores, L: L 1⁄4 h þ 2R. A pore of radius R was introduced by identifying the coordinates of the pore center, removing the C atoms within a circular disk of radius R, and also removing any C atoms at the pore edge that were left with only one bond as a result of this procedure to avoid highly under-coordinated defects at pore edges. These geometrical parameters determine the material density through the relation (for hexagonal pore lattices with
circular pores) h=L 1⁄4 1  ð2pffi3ffiffi=pÞ1=2ð1  q=q0Þ1=2, where q0 is the normal density of perfect, pristine single-layer graphene; 1–q/q0 is a metric of the GNM’s porosity. The above formula indicates that setting q and L determines the GNM’s neck width h; different values of L result in different values of h at given q. Therefore, we carried out simulations for two different values of L, namely, 36 and 24 C-C bond lengths (5.1 and 3.4 nm, respectively), while systematically varying q. For L  5.1 nm and 3.4 nm, h ranges from
0.6 nm to 4.5 nm and from 0.6 nm to 2.9 nm, respectively. The reasons we chose these two values of L are that they are within the range of experimental interest (under 10 nm) and they are substantially different from each other (by 50%), so the separate examination of GNMs with these parameter values can indicate any important differences in qualitative trends in the mechanical behavior, where detailed geometrical parameters of pore spacing beyond the nanomesh porosity or density should be considered as well. We investigated the mechanical and structural response of these GNMs based on MD simulations of uniaxial tensile deformation tests. The MD simulations were carried out using the LAMMPS software package15 with the interatomic interactions described according to the adaptive interatomic reactive empirical bond-order (AIREBO) potential;16 the C-C cutoff distance in the potential energy function was set to 2.0 A ̊ to avoid spurious effects at higher bond strains.17–19 The velocity Verlet algorithm was implemented to integrate the classical equations of motion with a time-step size of 0.1 fs. The temperature was kept at 300 K using a Nose-Hoover thermostat.20 An almost square-shaped 53 nm  51 nm supercell model was used to represent the unstrained GNMs that contained a number of C atoms ranging from 20 880 to 102 960 over the range of porosities examined. In the simulated deformation tests, an applied strain rate of 109 s1 was used with 1000 time steps at each strain increment for averaging the atomic-level stress, which was computed according to the virial theorem and averaged over the entire supercell. During the MD simulations of the deformation tests, the cell length in the directions perpendicular to the applied straining direction was kept constant. Following this procedure, we obtained a tensile strength and failure strain of 90 GPa and 13% and of 107 GPa and 20% for straining perfect, pristine single-layer graphene along the armchair and along the zigzag direction, respectively, in good agreement with values for these properties reported in the literature.19,21
III. MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF GRAPHENE NANOMESHES
Representative results from our MD simulations of uniaxial straining are shown in Fig. 2, where stress-strain curves, showing the engineering (nominal) stress as a function of the engineering (nominal) strain, are plotted for GNMs with L 1⁄4 36 C-C bond lengths as a function of material density. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the mechanical response for straining along the zigzag and the armchair direction, respectively. It is evident from Fig. 2 that at low porosities (q > 0.80 q0), the stress drops very abruptly after the maximum stress, rmax, is reached, which is characteristic of failure due to brittle cleavage. However, as the GNM porosity increases, this drop in stress becomes increasingly less abrupt with decreasing density; this is accompanied by reaching the maximum stress at increasingly higher strains. These two features of the stress-strain plots imply that the ductility of the GNMs increases with increasing porosity over this density range (q < 0.80 q0). The direction of straining does not have any qualitative effects on the mechanical response but only quantitative effects, which implies some

anisotropy in the mechanical properties, consistent with that of perfect, pristine single-layer graphene; this anisotropy is not particularly strong. In general, it is clear from the results of Fig. 2 that the most important effects on the mechanical behavior of GNMs are those of varying density/porosity. It should be mentioned that a systematic analysis of anisotropy effects in the study of Ref. 11 concluded that the highest differences in the elastic properties and strength of GNMs occurred between straining along the armchair direction and straining along the zigzag direction. Moreover, the same study showed that the pore lattice arrangement does not have any noticeable effect on the elastic response and overall mechanical behavior of GNMs.11 This observation is elucidated and quantified by the results of Fig. 3. For each porosity reported in Fig. 3, more than 5 independent MD simulations were carried out and
results averaged over 5 such independent simulations are depicted; the corresponding error bars are comparable to the size of the symbols used in the plots. The main plots and the insets in Fig. 3 show results for L 1⁄4 36 and L 1⁄4 24 C-C bond

Stress-strain curves from uniaxial tensile straining of GNMs along (a) the zigzag and (b) the armchair direction as a function of the material density q obtained from an individual MD simulation of the straining experiment. In both cases (a) and (b), the straining direction is indicated in the GNM schematic representation depicted in the inset. The GNM densities q/q0, where q0 is the normal density of perfect single-layer graphene, are: (1) 0.993, (2) 0.972, (3) 0.938, (4) 0.889, (5) 0.826, (6) 0.764, (7) 0.674, (8) 0.597, (9) 0.479, (10) 0.347, and (11) 0.201 for GNMs with center-to-center distance between neighboring pores equal to 36 C-C bond lengths.

Open squares and open circles denote results from MD simulations of uniaxial tensile straining along the zigzag and the armchair direction, respectively. All the results are obtained from averaging over five independent MD simulations.

lengths, respectively. Comparing the results in the main plots with those in the insets indicates that the mechanical response of the nanomeshes does not change with varying L and that the effect of varying L on the mechanical properties is at most quantitative (if there is any effect at all). Figure 3(a) depicts the porosity dependence of the strain-to-failure, emax, for both directions of straining. For porosities 1 q=q0 < 0.15, emax decreases with increasing porosity, and subsequently increases monotonically with increasing porosity over the range 1q=q0 > 0.20, which explains the increased ductility observed in the stress-strain curves of Fig. 2 at higher porosities. That emax exhibits such a minimum as a function of porosity is an important result, which means that, for the hexagonal pore lattices with unpassivated circular pores examined, there is an onset of a transition in the mechanical response of the nanomeshes at a critical GNM porosity value of 0.15. Figure 3(b) shows that, in every case examined, the ultimate tensile strength rmax is a monotonically decreasing function of porosity, as expected from the stress-strain curves of Fig. 2. However, it is remarkable that even the weakest, most porous GNM structures examined, with porosities 80%, have tensile strengths well above 5 GPa. Therefore, these nanomeshes outperform most conventional engineering materials with tensile strength used as the performance criterion; as a reference, we mention that metals have tensile strengths ranging typically from 0.1 to 1 GPa. Figure 3(c) shows the porosity dependence of the
material toughness, which expresses the energy dissipated in
the fracture process and is given by the integral Ð emax
0 rde. The signature of the transition in the GNM mechanical response is evident in Fig. 3(c) as well: The GNM toughness decreases monotonically with increasing porosity over the low porosity range, but practically saturates beyond the critical porosity value. It should be mentioned that the deformation is not elastic past the peak stress; although the toughness does not increase beyond the critical porosity as it would in a typical case of ductile response, it is not equal to the elastic strain energy but also contains a non-elastic contribution. However, this inelastic contribution is small (<10% of the elastic contribution) and decreases continuously with increasing porosity; this indicates that there is no substantial porosity-induced toughening of the GNM structures. Figure 4 shows representative results for the GNM structural response under tensile uniaxial straining from two MD simulations for GNMs with low and high porosity. In addition to the structural response, the stress distribution in the material is monitored during the straining test, with the atomic-level von Mises stress, rVM, the second scalar invariant of the atomic-level stress tensor, used as the stress metric. The structural evolution of a low-porosity GNM, 1–q=q0 1⁄4 0.028, is shown in Fig. 4(a). Fracture is initiated at e  0.102 when a crack forms on the edge of the pore that has been marked in panel (ii) of Fig. 4(a) and propagates along a zigzag direction. The crack originates at a site of

The regions marked in panel (ii) of (a) and (c) are magnified in (b) and (d), respectively, to elucidate the structural evolution near the onset of fracture in the two cases of different porosity.

high stress concentration on the pore edge and its propagation leads to substantial stress relief in the vicinity of the pore. Another crack soon forms at another site of high stress concentration on the pore edge that is diametrically opposite to the original site of crack initiation and propagates in the opposite sense along the same zigzag direction. These cracks are sharp and continue their propagation along the same zigzag direction even after they reach the edge of the next neighboring pore along this direction. This crack formation and propagation process, with the accompanying stress relief caused around the pore, is detailed in the magnified view of Fig. 4(b). Subsequently, more cracks form, emanating from sites on the pore edge symmetrically located with respect to the previous sites, which also are sharp and propagate along another zigzag direction, at 60 with respect to the original zigzag direction, and leading to stress relief for the remaining vicinity of the pore. After its initiation, this process repeats itself involving an increasing number of pores until the stress is relieved fully with the brittle failure of the sample. The crack propagation speed characteristic of this brittle cleavage mechanism is extremely fast; the time that has elapsed between panels (ii) and (iii) of Fig. 4(a) is a fraction of a picosecond. It should be mentioned that, for very small pores, the pore shape at the GNM’s unstrained state is not strictly circular but rather hexagonal. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the sharp corners of these small apparently “hexagonal” pores are the sites where the highest stress concentration occurs under straining. This will have a small effect in slightly lowering the ultimate strength of the GNM although it does not change the observed trends as a function of GNM porosity and the transition in the mechanical behavior of the nanomeshes. However, increasing the pore radius R eliminates this slight morphological effect and the pores are strictly circular at the unstrained state of the GNMs, which is evident by the rounded pore morphologies of Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). The fracture mechanism is completely different for GNMs with high porosity, as shown in Fig. 4(c) at 1–q=q0 1⁄4 0.403. In such a case, neck widths are less than 10 C-C bond lengths and neighboring pore edges are very near each other. Fracture is initiated at e  0.118 when a crack forms at a site on the lower edge of the upper pore in the GNM region marked in panel (ii) of Fig. 4(c). The thinner part of the neck in this region is characterized by high stress concentration and the crack formation causes local stress relief. The crack propagates fast along a zigzag direction, but, halfway through the neck, it changes its direction of propagation to another zigzag direction at 60 with respect to the original direction, as detailed in the magnified view of Fig. 4(d), panels (iii) and (iv). This change in the direction of crack propagation is caused by the high stress concentration on one side of the crack edge, panel (iii) of Fig. 4(d). In conjunction with the breaking of a neighboring bond on the same side of the crack edge, panel (iv), this process leads to yet another change in the direction of crack propagation, along a zigzag direction parallel to the original direction of crack propagation, resulting in considerable blunting of the crack tip, as shown in panel (v) of Fig. 4(d). At this stage, however, the unbroken neck between the two neighboring
pores has been reduced to a monatomic carbon chain that eventually breaks, leading to the coalescence of the two pores; such strong monatomic carbon chain formation is common in the deformation of graphene-based nanomaterials.22 This crack formation and propagation process is initiated randomly at various pore edges, leading to a rupture-like failure process through pore coalescence that completely alleviates stress in the GNM structure, as shown in panel (v) of Fig. 4(c).
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we carried out a systematic moleculardynamics study of the mechanical behavior and fracture of graphene nanomeshes under uniaxial tensile straining over a broad range of nanomesh porosity. We discovered the onset of a transition in the mechanical response of the nanomeshes at a critical porosity value 15%, for which the fracture strain exhibits a minimum as a function of the material density. This transition in the mechanical behavior guarantees the ductility and toughness of the nanomeshes even at very high porosity (up to 80%), while their strength remains high (well over 5 GPa). These findings have far-reaching implications: Graphene nanomeshes remain strong and tough even when they are very porous, with neck widths of only a few nanometers. This allows for a broad tailoring of the graphene nanomesh architecture toward optimizing electronic and transport properties, while guaranteeing their structural integrity and mechanical reliability.
