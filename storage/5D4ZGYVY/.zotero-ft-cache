ABSTRACT: A bottleneck in many studies utilizing singlemolecule Förster resonance energy transfer is the attainable photon count rate, as it determines the temporal resolution of the experiment. As many biologically relevant processes occur on time scales that are hardly accessible with currently achievable photon count rates, there has been considerable effort to find strategies to increase the stability and brightness of fluorescent dyes. Here, we use DNA nanoantennas to drastically increase the achievable photon count rates and observe fast biomolecular dynamics in the small volume between two plasmonic nanoparticles. As a proof of concept, we observe the coupled folding and binding of two intrinsically disordered proteins, which form transient encounter complexes with lifetimes on the order of 100 μs. To test the limits of our approach, we also investigated the hybridization of a short single-stranded DNA to its complementary counterpart, revealing a transition path time of 17 μs at photon count rates of around 10 MHz, which is an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the state of the art. Concomitantly, the photostability was increased, enabling many seconds long megahertz fluorescence time traces. Due to the modular nature of the DNA origami method, this platform can be adapted to a broad range of biomolecules, providing a promising approach to study previously unobservable ultrafast biophysical processes.

INTRODUCTION
Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments are a cornerstone in the investigation of
biomolecular dynamics,1 as they enable the observation of the molecule of interest “in action”, specifically within its natural environment, and give a real-time movie that can span time scales from milliseconds to minutes or in some cases even
hours.2 Crucially, although methods enabling access to faster
time scales through correlation techniques exist,3,4 timeresolving individual rare events, such as the rapid jumps across the barriers between two conformational states (e.g., protein or nucleic acid folding), require very high count rates from single
molecules.5,6 These transition paths have gained increasing interest, and smFRET experiments have been playing a major
role in revealing the nature and time scales of these paths.7,8 However, the photon count rate (PCR) required for accessing the relevant microsecond time scale mandates the use of high excitation intensities, leading to saturation and increased photobleaching, which makes the task of measuring these transition paths very challenging. Plasmonic hotspots have been shown to increase the photostability and brightness of
fluorescent labels9,10 and offer a potentially complementary strategy to the more commonly used chemical photo
stabilization.11−13 Coupling the emitters to plasmonic hotspots not only increases the electric field between the two plasmonic nanoparticles but also increases the emission rates of the fluorophore, leading to a shorter time that the molecule spends
in the reactive excited states as well as reducing the time until
the fluorophore is available for re-excitation.14,15 This, in turn, results in improved photostability of fluorescent labels and also
enables higher fluorescence intensities without saturation.9,16,17 First examples employing similar strategies for diffusing
molecules have appeared and showed promising results,18,19 but they are limited to the submillisecond time scales of molecular diffusion through the excitation volume, which makes the complete observation of complex biomolecular
pathways unlikely. DNA origami nanoantennas20,21 have overcome the challenge of selective immobilization of biomolecules in plasmonic hotspots. Recent iterations have optimized the usability of the plasmonic hotspots in NAnoantennas with Cleared HOtSpots (NACHOS), improving binding kinetics and the immobilization of larger functional
entities such as diagnostic assays22 and even antibodies23 in these zeptoliter volumes with an estimated gap size of 12−16
nm.15 In this work, we explore the use of NACHOS for biophysical single-molecule FRET experiments. Recent studies have shown that the electromagnetic environment of

plasmonic hotspots has an influence on the FRET rate
coefficient as well as the FRET efficiency,24−26 but their use in biophysics is largely unexplored. Here, we optimize DNA origami nanoantennas for biophysical experiments with a careful selection of parameters, including the choice of donor and acceptor fluorophores. With optimized hotspots, we demonstrate strongly enhanced count rates and long-lasting single-molecule FRET time traces. Unaltered biomolecular function is demonstrated by reproducing the lifetime of a short-lived intermediate in the coupled folding and binding of two intrinsically disordered proteins. Transition path times down to a few microseconds are then reported for a DNA hybridization reaction.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
An important first step in this endeavor is the choice of a suitable FRET pair. Photophysical characteristics such as the
formation of short-lived dark or dim states9 can complicate the analysis of the data and need to be avoided or accounted for in the analysis. Furthermore, both fluorophores should be spectrally red-shifted with respect to the plasmon resonance
of the gold dimer nanoantenna.27 In consideration of these aspects, we examined FRET pairs covering the red and near-IR spectral region (a deeper discussion on dye selection and DNA origami nanoantenna production is found in Supporting Note 1). First, we investigated the binding of the nuclear coactivator
binding domain of the CBP/p300 transcription factor (NCBD) to the activation domain of SRC-3 (ACTR).
Previous studies with smFRET30 revealed that these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) form a transient encounter complex before they form a fully folded heterodimer. The lifetime of this encounter complex has been determined experimentally to approximately 80−100 μs,
depending on the ionic strength of the buffer,30 which offers a way to test whether our system is compatible with measuring protein dynamics. Using a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) handle attached to a cysteine residue close to the N-terminus, we immobilized ACTR labeled with AlexaFluor 647 in the plasmonic hotspot (Figure 1a,b). Free NCBD labeled with LD750 was then added to the imaging buffer, which led to the appearance of short segments of high FRET efficiency in the fluorescence recordings, indicating the binding of NCBD to ACTR. To identify nanoantennas showing reversible binding events without prematurely photobleaching the FRET pair, we started the acquisition of single-molecule fluorescence trajectories at lower excitation intensities (10−20 nW). Then, we increased the excitation intensity (1−4 μW) to acquire high-intensity time traces. With the fluorescence enhancement and increased photostability provided by the DNA origami nanoantenna, we were able to increase the average photon count rate by almost 3-fold to 588 kHz
compared to earlier studies with a different FRET pair30 (see Supporting Note 2) and achieved a maximum photon count

rate of over 2 MHz, with a mean observation time of 0.66 s, which also represents a significant improvement. While intermediates with longer lifetimes can sometimes be directly observed in the time traces (Figure 1c, left), quantifying intermediates with shorter lifetimes remains challenging (Figure 1c, right; see Figure S1 for more examples). Consistent with previous mechanistic studies of FRET in plasmonic
nanostructures,24−26 the FRET efficiency of the bound state is decreased in the plasmonic hotspot�we obtained a mean value of <EB> = 0.49 (uncorrected, compare Figure S7). In order to fully quantify the most likely lifetime of the intermediate state, we used the photon-by-photon maximum
likelihood approach.7,30,31 Here, the likelihood of a transition between two states via an intermediate with FRET efficiency EI and lifetime τi is compared to the likelihood of an instantaneous transition (Figure 1d). To account for acceptor
blinking, we included an additional dark state in the analysis.32 We also normalized each EI value to the respective transitionwise bound state (EB) and unbound state (EU) FRET efficiency values: Ei, norm = (EI − EU)/(EB − EU), to account for the slightly broadened FRET distributions resulting from the heterogeneous fluorescence enhancement by the nanoantenna (see the Supporting Information for details on the analysis). This means that for an Ei, norm value of 0.5, the intermediate state lies exactly halfway between EU and EB. As we noticed a decrease of the total photon count rate of the system upon binding of NCBD (Figure S1), we additionally
carried out simulations of binding events with nonconstant total photon count rates and found no significant influence on the robustness of the analysis (see Supporting Note 3 and Figures S3 and S4). From a total of 141 transitions, we obtained a value of 96 ± 13 μs for the most likely lifetime of the intermediate state and an Ei, norm value of 0.58 ± 0.04 (nonnormalized Ei = 0.28 ± 0.01, Figure 1e,f). These values are in excellent agreement with previously reported values at similar
ionic strength (90 ± 10 μs),30 which illustrates the potential of our approach to be applied to other biomolecular processes. To test our approach on even faster reactions and simultaneously avoid potential negative effects on the photostability of our labels by the neighboring amino acids and
labeling chemistries (e.g., cysteine or maleimide),33 we next set out to investigate the transient binding of a short ssDNA to a ssDNA docking site placed in the plasmonic hotspot. DNA− DNA hybridization is believed to occur via a 2−3 nucleotide (nt) nucleation site, which then transforms into the stably
bound state via zippering of the remaining bases.34 In our experiments, we used a 6 nt long ssDNA labeled with Dy-751 at the 3′-end, which hybridizes to a docking site labeled at the
3′-end with a Cy5B35,36 fluorophore (Figure 2a). We achieved a mean PCR of 2.42 MHz and a maximum count rate of 8.93 MHz, which is approximately an order of magnitude higher than previously reported PCRs in smFRET experiments (600−
900 kHz)7,37,38 and also substantially higher than what we observed in the experiments described earlier. It is worth

emphasizing that because of the increased photostability, we were sometimes able to observe the same molecule for up to ∼30 s at photon count rates of ∼2 MHz and record up to 57 million photons from one FRET pair (Figure 2b). This allowed us to occasionally observe more than 20 transitions on one molecule, which illustrates how the nanoantenna approach facilitates data acquisition. Figure 2c shows two exemplary snapshots from fluorescence time traces of a binding event (see Figure S2 for more examples). At the chosen 2−4 μs bin sizes, acceptor blinking becomes visible (indicated by arrows), substantiating the need to account for it in the analysis. We observed a total of 405 transitions and analyzed these according to the photon-by-photon maximum-likelihood approach described above. We found a mean value of the uncorrected FRET efficiency of the bound state of 0.48, a most likely transition path time of 17 ± 1 μs and an Ei, norm value of 0.30 ± 0.02 (non-normalized Ei = 0.19 ± 0.01, Figure 2b). To test the influence of the FRET pair on the results, we repeated the experiment with AlexaFluor 647 as the donor and ATTO740 as the acceptor fluorophores. Although we were able to achieve slightly higher count rates (mean count rate: 5.34 MHz, with maximum count rates of up to 16.4 MHz, see Figure S3), the FRET efficiency of the bound state was notably lower (<EB> = 0.30), potentially making it more difficult to distinguish between the bound and the unbound states. This can at least partially be explained by the lower Förster radius of this dye pair (Table S3). Nevertheless, we still obtained a transition path time that agrees with the one measured with the Cy5B/Dy-751 FRET pair (τi = 20 ± 3 μs) with a most likely value for Ei, norm of 0.21 ± 0.02. Previous FRET studies on DNA hairpin formation were able to determine an upper bound of 2.5 μs for the hybridization of
a 4 nt long hairpin stem,39 and optical tweezer experiments
reported values around 30 μs for much longer hairpins.40 Our results thus lie in a plausible range of transition path times for the 6 nt DNA−DNA hybridization event, although further experiments will be needed to fully understand the process of hybridization. For example, in preliminary experiments, the inclusion of an AT-mismatch in the short strand labeled with ATTO740 led to an increase of τi to 41 ± 3 μs with a similar value for Ei, norm of 0.229 ± 0.012 (see Figure S4).

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we showed that DNA origami nanoantennas can be used to accelerate data acquisition and increase the attainable photon count rates in smFRET experiments on biomolecular dynamics. As a proof of concept, we investigated the coupled folding and binding of two IDPs as well as the hybridization of two ssDNAs and showed that we could resolve processes on the microsecond time scale. With the
resulting higher time resolution,41,42 previously inaccessible biological processes could be investigated. To this end, the modular nature of the DNA origami technique allows for the swift incorporation of new biomolecules of interest, making this platform broadly applicable as a tool for the improvement of temporal resolution in smFRET experiments. We anticipate a broad range of possible protein targets, with limitations posed by the size of the plasmonic hotspot as well as possible unwanted interactions between the protein and the DNA origami (e.g., DNA binding proteins). Additionally, appropriate labeling, e.g., of the protein with a fluorophore and a ssDNA anchor is required.
Another benefit that we did not focus on in this work is the possibility to work at much higher concentrations of labeled species due to the ultrasmall volume of fluorescence enhancement in the nanoantennas, which also allows the observation of biomolecular interactions with micromolar dissociation con
stants43�we estimated the dissociation constant of the mismatched DNA−DNA interaction (Figure S4) to 200 μM and still were able to clearly resolve the binding events at 3.6 μM concentration of the short strand in solution (Figure S8). Recent iterations of the DNA origami nanoantenna could accommodate even larger biomolecules and should further reduce the potential impact of the constricted environment on
the experiments.44 The development of new near-infrared fluorophores showing less blinking on the low microsecond
time scale,45 which potentially interferes with the maximumlikelihood analysis, should make it possible to further push the time resolution and possibly, in combination with more efficient sampling methods, bridge the gap toward the time
scales of molecular dynamics simulations.46−48
