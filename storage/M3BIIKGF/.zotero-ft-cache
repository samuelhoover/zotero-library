ABSTRACT: Complex coacervation, a specific type of associative phase separation that happens when oppositely charged macro-ions (or polyelectrolytes) are mixed, is the formation of a dense macro-ion-rich phase (the coacervate) in equilibrium with a dilute macro-ion-poor phase (the continuous phase or supernatant). Since Bungenberg de Jong and colleagues’ ground-breaking work on the gelatin−acacia gum complex coacervation in the 1920s and 1940s, coacervates have drawn increasing research attention because they are essential to a wide range of established and developing technologies. Charge complexation in solution may play a role in this association. Unfortunately, misconceptions about the theoretical foundations of complex coacervation are common, and conceptual errors have persisted in the literature. This Review is an attempt to provide a concise and comprehensive overview of the main research streams pursued in this field regarding the parameters influencing the formation of complex coacervates, encompassing various technological aspects enabling the investigation of complex coacervates in industrial applications. Coacervate complex formation is a well-known and widely used, but poorly understood, phenomenon in physical polymer science. Finally, a critical assessment of perspectives and anticipated difficulties in the further development and improvement of next-generation materials is suggested, and insights into the field’s future prospects are explored.
1. INTRODUCTION
In both the natural and synthetic worlds, charged soft matter is pervasive. The presence of electrostatic interactions allows systems to respond to stimuli and enhances the potential for self-assembly. In fact, theories about the origin of life have historically referred to charge-driven assemblies. In this review, we focus on a group of charged substances known as complex coacervates, which have proven to be remarkably adaptable in recent years. In general, biopolymer mixtures in aqueous solutions exhibit a thermodynamic instability that macroscopically manifests as a phase separation. The Latin word “coacervare”, which means “to crowd together, to pile up”, is where the word “coacervation” originates. De Jong reported the “complex coacervation” phenomenon in 1929, which is the separation of gum arabic (a carbohydrate polyanion) and gelatin (a polycation below pH 4.8) solutions into polymer
rich and -poor liquid phases on mixing.1 Complex coacervation, a particular kind of associative phase separation, is a spontaneous liquid/liquid phase separation that results from the combination of oppositely charged macro-ions (or polyelectrolytes, PEs). A dense macro-ion-rich phase, known as the coacervate, is formed during coacervation and is in equilibrium with a dilute macro-ion-poor phase, known as the
continuous phase or supernatant.2−4 The broad significance of coacervates has prompted a recent research boom over the past 10 years, resulting in new basic ideas in science, nextgeneration functional (bio)materials, and the foundation for a
new wave of contemporary materials that is expanding the frontiers of polymer physics and chemistry. Because of its vast scope, which includes physical chemistry, biochemistry, colloid science, chemical, biological, biomedical, and materials engineering, as well as the engagement of natural and synthetic polymers in a wide range of combinations with other charged and uncharged components, the literature on complex coacervation is incredibly intimidating. In this review, we are limiting our discussion to describing and contextualizing the recent advances in the science and engineering of polymer− polymer complex coacervates, without attempting to cover the entire field. We do this by highlighting the following: (i) why this research flurry was necessary; (ii) what the soft matter community has accomplished; and (iii) some of the exciting directions this research has opened up. A critical assessment of the obstacles impeding the creation of next-generation materials is also covered, along with an examination of the field’s prospects.

2. MECHANISMS OF COMPLEX COACERVATION
2.1. Interactions in the Complexation of Polyelectrolytes. The term “coacervation”, which refers to the previous union of the colloidal particles, was first used by
Bungenberg de Jong and Kruyt1 in their ground-breaking research. The term “coacervation” describes how the colloidal particles come together. Colloidal particles are defined as liquid droplets, also known as coacervates, which are mostly caused by demixing (Figure 1A). It is derived from the Latin
“acervus”, which means aggregation (a heap), and the prefix “co” (together). Tiebackx first mentioned this process without
using the term in 1911;5 he discovered that adding an acid to a mixture of gum arabic and gelatin causes phase separation. The term “coacervation” was first used by Bungenberg de Jong and Kruyt, who used optical microscopy (OM) to examine the phase behavior of several binary mixtures, almost two decades later. The separation of colloidal systems into two liquid phases�the equilibrium solution and the coacervate, which is the phase with the higher concentration of the colloid component�is known as coacervation, according to
IUPAC.6 Bungenberg de Jong, a pioneer in the field of colloid chemistry at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, expounded upon the phenomenology of complex coacervation in multiple exceptional chapters found in Colloid Science II, edited by H.R. Kruyt, written over several years and finally
published in 1949.7,8 In that book, Bungenberg de Jong and Kruyt reported the observation of two types of coacervation: (i) simple and (ii) complex. Phase separation is brought about in simple coacervation by adding ineffective and incompatible solvents (such as acetone, alcohols, etc.) to the aqueous polymer solution, whereas complex coacervation is typically
defined as the phase separation of a dense, polymer-rich coacervate phase and a polymer-poor supernatant phase, which
arises from the association/electrostatic interactions9 between macro-ions with opposite charges as these associates get closer
to electroneutrality.10−13 Figure 1B provides a schematic
illustration of the intricate coacervation mechanism,14 whereas Figure 1C displays a typical phase diagram of complex
coacervation.7 In general, some researchers have embraced an approach where coacervation is driven by long-range electrostatic interactions and PEs are defined by charge level, chain length,
and chain flexibility, but lack chemical identity otherwise.15−17 Others have described polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) formation as the outcome of competitive local binding interactions between monomers and salts, focusing on the local interactions between the monomer and salt species for which chemical similarity is crucial. For lack of better terms, we will refer to the former strategy as “physics-based” and the latter as “chemistry-based” going forward. Certain “chemistrybased” methods entirely disregard the long-range electrostatics, which in certain solely “physics-based” theories serve as the
only source of coacervation.18,19 The behavior of PEs and coacervates has been clarified by both the “physics-based” and “chemistry-based” approaches; however, in order for the field to advance further, the two approaches must be combined in order to identify the contributions to coacervation of both long-range non-specific and short-range specific interactions. In “physics-based” approach the Debye−Hückel (DH) free energy is combined with a mixing entropy for the species in the Voorn−Overbeek (VO) theory, which is the first model of
PE coacervation.17 Then, in the presence of salt ions, which can screen these attractions, competition between mixing entropy and long-range electrostatic attractions of polyanions and polycations causes coacervation. The inability of the DH theory to take into account PE chain connectivity and electrostatic correlations at high ionic strengths (even for
monovalent salt ions) are two of its main flaws.20−22 The
random phase approximation (RPA),15,23−25 field theoretic
simulations (FTSs),16,26,27 theories based on liquid states
(LSs),21,28 and scaling theories29−31 have all been used in an attempt to address this restriction (discussed later in the text). In a “chemistry-based” approach depending on the chemical makeup of the PE monomers and salts, a coacervate can exhibit rheological characteristics for a fixed concentration, charge pattern, and temperature that range from a viscous liquid to a
glassy solid.32 The impacts of the specificity of charged groups (i.e., ions and PE monomers) are mostly reflected in their
hydration,32−34 which in turn affects how the charged groups
interact at short distances, in addition to charge regulation.35 Water molecules have a high polarity that attracts bare charged groups in solution and forms a hydration shell around them,
reducing the entropy of their mixing.36,37 This can be thought of as the solvent affinity or “hydrophilicity” of the charged group. The quantity of fluids attracted into a hydration shell of a charged group in aqueous solutions relies on several factors (such as the size of the charged group, dispersion interactions, etc.). In aqueous solutions, oppositely charged groups tend to
associate more strongly when the solvent affinity is smaller.32,33
For example, cations with lower solvent affinities, like Cs+,
form stronger “pairs” with Cl− ions in water than do highly
hydrated Li+ ions, according to research by Douglas, de Pablo,
and colleagues.33 This result is consistent with the work done over a century ago by Hofmeister, who found that more

hydrophobic anions denature proteins more readily than highly hydrated ones do because of their stronger affinity to
proteins.38 Similar interactions cause hydrophobic PEs to strongly associate with one another, which in turn causes them to localize at the water−air interface or phase separate in
solutions (as will be covered later).39 Traditionally, these hydrophobic interactions of PEs with water are crudely described by the mean-field Flory−Huggins (FH) χPW parameter. Apart from hydrophobicity, other factors that might promote the binding of oppositely charged groups at short distances include hydrogen bonding, the release of overlapping hydration fluids, π−π interactions, and, of course, electrostatic
attractions.40−45 A fascinating work by Sinn et al. demonstrated
that K+ and Cl− ions could even connect to a neutral polymer
by releasing hydration waters.46 This suggests that binding between two species might occur without the need for electrostatic attractions. As initially proposed by Veis and Aranyi, coacervation can be thought of as the result of a reaction between polyanions and polycations, providing a relatively straightforward “chemistry-based” approach that
concentrates on the local interactions.47 In this vein, an ionexchange coacervation model based on a local charge-binding picture of PEC formation was developed by the Schlenoff
group.19 According to this concept, ion−PE couplings compete with polyanion−polycation pairings to produce the PEC:
(A ) (C ) (AC) ( ) ( )
Gf
0
+ + + + + + (1)
Here, an ion pair between the charged polyanion (A) and polycation (C) monomers is represented by (AC), (A+) indicates a charged polyanion monomer coupled to a tiny cation, while the charged polycation monomer-anion pair is represented by (C−). The standard free energy of PEC
formation is represented by ΔGff (the subscript “f” stands for “formation”), and the salt cation and anion are indicated by the
symbols (+)+ and (−)−, respectively.19 According to the mechanism described above, a PEC occurs if there is an energy and entropic advantage to ion-pairing between PEs and any accompanying release of salt ions that are initially coupled to PEs. After taking into consideration all of these variables, the overall strength of the PEC formation is determined by the
equilibrium constant κf = exp(ΔGf0).32,48,49 This has an inverse
known as the “doping” constant, κdop = 1/κf, which expresses how well salt ions work in salt solutions to break ion pairs and
dissociate PECs [the opposite of process (1)].49 By adjusting salt anions along a Hofmeister series, Schlenoff and colleagues have recently demonstrated that more hydrophobic salt anions (with lower hydration numbers) partition more into the PEC phase than the dilute phase and are more effective at breaking
ion-pairs (i.e., have a higher doping constant κdop).49,50 Anions’ relative hydrophobicity is reflected in their capacity to break ion pairs and dope PECs, as well as in their capacity to
denature proteins, as noted by Hofmeister.38,51 The Schlenoff group discovered that the more hydrophobic PEs produce glassy, solid PECs with stronger ion pairs that are particularly difficult for salt ions to separate. These findings run parallel to
the previously mentioned investigations on the salt type.32 The phase diagrams are frequently left “open” at the top, and Tirrell, de Pablo, and colleagues demonstrated that more hydrophobic PEs tend to create PECs that require high salt concentrations to dissolve. In one instance, the coacervate did
not dissolve even at a very high [NaCl] of 6 M.52 Hydration level functions as a sort of “master” control parameter in the phase behavior and rheology of coacervates, as demonstrated
by the Lutkenhaus and Shull groups, among others.53,54 Various PEs and salt ions influence behavior by drawing waters of hydration into the coacervate. In a recent work, Spruijt and colleagues exploited the chemical specificity of different coacervate droplets, each formed from a unique pair of polyanion and polycation, to form multiphase droplets that resembled the structure of cell nuclei due to the immiscibility
of the original coacervates.55 The significance of the chemical identity impacts of PE monomers and salt ions in the phase behavior of coacervates is amply demonstrated by these innovative experiments. However, the significance of chemical effects does not imply that electrostatic correlations in PE solutions are insignificant; therefore, quantitative predictions of coacervation must incorporate concepts from both fields, even though qualitative predictions can be produced using either the “physics-based” or “chemistry-based” models. Now, although numerous earlier papers have examined the reactions of complex coacervates to various salts; however, as the majority of those reports have concentrated on ion valency and
Hoffmeister effects,18,56−58 we also take use of the fact that

cation−π interactions should be possible not just with the cations of any salts present in solution but also between the aromatic functional groups and the charged sites on the
cationic polymer.59 These cations may “take up” a portion of the aromatic sites and keep them from interacting with other molecules within the chain, as Figure 2a schematically illustrates. If interactions between cations and π are important in stabilizing complex formation, then interactions with the salt should also decrease the number of advantageous intrachain cation−π contacts and destabilize the complexes. Furthermore,
the stronger the salt’s interaction with the aromatic rings, the more pronounced this destabilization should be. Nonetheless, there are numerous ways in which cation−π interactions could impact the stability of the complexes. First, it is possible that the majority of the cation−π interactions are interchain ones, taking place mostly between the aromatic and cationic sites of the polyanion and polycation chains. Strong cation−π interactions between salts may then outcompete these interchain cation−π interactions, causing the complexes to become unstable. Alternatively, the presence of such salts

may also cause disruptions to intrachain cation−π interactions, such as those between cationic and aromatic sites on the same polycation chain. Lastly, the addition of new cationic sites to the chains through the binding of the salt cations to the aromatic rings may alter the effective charge density of the aromatic polymers and boost their hydrophilicity. In order to comprehend the basic function of cation−π interactions in these materials and to design systems that either exploit or suppress such interactions to achieve desired properties, it is crucial to distinguish between these various mechanisms by which cation−π interactions affect the complexation process.
Huang et al.60 used “asymmetric” mixing studies, in which aromatic polycations are mixed with non-aromatic polyanions and vice versa, to differentiate between these various methods. Only when non-aromatic polycations are mixed with aromatic polyanions should signatures of cation−π interactions (i.e., dependence on the salt present in solution) be observed, if the most significant interactions are those between charged sites on the polycation and aromatic sites on the polyanion, as illustrated in Figure 2c. However, the largest cation dependence should be seen in the complexation of aromatic polycations with non-aromatic polyanions if intrachain interactions within the polycations predominate. The stability of both types of complexes should ultimately depend on the salt cation if changes in the effective charge density are the dominant factor. Complexes involving aromatic polycations will be more stabilized in the presence of strongly binding cations (as the cationic polymer’s effective charge density increases), while complexes involving aromatic polyanions will be destabilized in the presence of strongly binding cations (as the anionic polymer’s effective charge density decreases).
2.2. Phase Behavior in Polyelectrolyte Complexation. Overbeek et al. and Michaeli et al. reported phase separation (consist of a polymer-rich complex coacervate phase and a polymer dilute phase) to be achieved at low concentrations of
polymer and salt.17,61 (discussed later in the text, also refer to
Figure 3.1) It is greatly simplified to say that the polyanion and polycation species are symmetric and can be thought of as a
single component in both its original form17,61 and the
majority of later research.62−65 An efficient three-component system is created by applying the same simplification to the anion and cation in the additional salt (PEs, salt ions, and water). Several researchers highlighted complexation of oppositely charged PEs, driven by both electrostatic and entropic forces, results in complex coacervation, a liquid− liquid phase separation phenomenon (Figure 3.2, parts a and
b).66−71 With its exceptionally low surface tension and ability to hold a sizable amount of water and ions, the ensuing coacervate phase has made these materials useful for a wide range of applications, including food, personal care, medicine delivery, and underwater adhesives. Additionally, coacervatelike droplets found in biological systems have drawn more
attention.72−74 Most of these so-called membraneless organelles (MLOs) are composed of inherently disordered proteins and RNA, and they phase separate as a result of a mix of short- and long-range hydrophobic and charge effects. Even while biological materials’ ability to self-assemble has been refined over millions of years by evolution, human capacity to create new biological materials is still constrained, in part due to the pertinent interactions’ varying length scales. Polymer melts and solutions frequently undergo segregative phase separation because many polymers have poor mixing enthalpies. When the polymers lengthen sufficiently, mixing entropy can no longer promote overall mixing, causing the mixture to separate into two phases that are each rich in a different polymer from the initial mixture. Since (bio)polymer mixtures frequently need to be stabilized, understanding phase compositions and compatibility requirements is crucial for the polymer processing, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Binodal compositions for combinations of two polymers in a single solvent can be displayed in a basic phase diagram, as Figure

3.3, part a, schematically illustrates. The strong favorable mixing enthalpies of negatively charged polymers is a result of the electrostatic attraction between their opposing charges, making them one of the rare cases. These polymers can also separate into phases, but in the process, they will end up in the same phase, with a low concentration of each polymer in the coexisting phase (see Figure 3.3, parts b and c). Using
fluorescently labeled polymers, Spruijt et al.75 directly quantified the binodal compositions of PECs of strongly charged poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA). Figure 3.3, part c, shows a schematic representation of this method. When the PAA was added, complexation happened right away if the concentration of salt was low enough. The complex originally floated through the mixture and was apparent as a pale white gel-like material. At this stage, each combination was given a good shake before being allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for a total of 5 days. The phase-separated mixtures become clear and the PEC settled after 1−3 h. All samples were gently centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min, 2 days after they were mixed. All phaseseparated mixes at this stage had two distinct, transparent phases (refer to Figure 3.4). The creation of a large PEC is the outcome of this associative phase separation. When the complex phase resembles a liquid, it is called a complex coacervate. With an increase in salt concentration, the macroscopic phase separation will progressively diminish; above a critical
value, all phase separation is suppressed.75,77 Complex coacervates are a viable material platform as a stimuliresponsive material because of their sensitivity to salt, especially for possible uses under various biological settings. Therefore, the material development of complex coacervates for a variety of applications depends on an understanding of the phase behavior. The phase behavior of complicated coacervates is typically described by a phase diagram. A generalized phase diagram for complicated coacervation derived from the VO theory is displayed in Figure 4. Four elements make up a typical coacervate system: polycations P,
polyanions Q, salt, and water.17,77 The broad form of the phase diagram is accurate, despite the VO theory’s flaws, which have been extensively described below (i.e., this theory ignores the actual size of molecules and the connectivity between polymer
chains).64,77 One can map the phase boundary of the complex coacervate system to a curved surface in three dimensions. Substances below this surface will separate into polymer-rich complex precipitate and polymer-poor supernatant through phase separation. More frequently, coacervation is taken into account for a system at a known, stoichiometric composition (discussed later in the text), and Figure 4c, a two-dimensional phase diagram, is used to illustrate the relationship between total polymer concentration and salt concentration.
By establishing molecular-level design guidelines, Chang78 modified the creation and properties of complex coacervates (Figure 5) through chemical sequencing. Due to the difficulty of synthesizing PEs with equal chain length and charge density but different charge distributions or other functionalities, studies to date have mostly concentrated on the effects of parameters such as the charge stoichiometry, temperature, pH,
salt concentration, stereochemistry,75,79−81 polymer architec
ture,82 and the density of charges present. However, the ability to pattern the sequence of charges and other chemistries has not been studied very often. Nonetheless, while maintaining relevance to a range of biological, medicinal, and commercial
applications, polypeptides serve as a model platform for the production and research of PEs with highly regulated polymer architecture and sequence patterning at the molecular
level.83,84 Chang’s hypothesis is that manipulation of the density and distribution of hydrophobicity and charge inside coacervating polymers can be utilized as a compositionindependent tactic to adjust the material’s phase behavior and possibly its rheological characteristics. Although Bungenberg de Jong originally named these liquidlike complexes of oppositely charged polymers or colloids after he noticed this phenomena in combinations of gum arabic and
gelatin,1 the complexes do not usually resemble liquids. According to several reports, there are two classes of polyelectrolyte complexation: complex precipitation and
complex coacervation.85 There is a phenomenological distinction between these two classes that is not yet well understood physically. Compared to the original gelatin−gum arabic system, associative phase separation is used in a lot more situations these days. For instance, microemulsions, vesicles, or
micelles,86−90 with intricate coacervate cores, can be employed
as drug carriers91,92 or enzyme packaging materials.93 Lemmers et al. have recently shown that fully reversible gels may also be
formed using polyelectrolyte complexation.94 Generally speaking, any of these nanostructures can be created and engineered by selecting the ideal ratio of repulsive to attractive forces between oppositely charged polymers or polymeric blocks and other elements like proteins, colloids, and neutral polymeric blocks. PEC formation can be used in more macroscopic systems to reversibly coat surfaces with polymer brushes at
grafting densities well above 1 nm−2,95 to prepare microgels with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) close to physiological temperature, which can be used as potential food fat replacements because they can catch and release charged
molecules upon heating.96−98 An accurate depiction of the associated phase separation would be beneficial for each of these instances of polyelectrolyte complexation. However, because a variety of factors can impact the development of PECs, such a description is complicated. Polymer chain length, charge density, polymer concentration, mixing ratio, temperature, pH, and salt concentration are the primary experimental parameters that need to be considered. Generally speaking, lengthy polymers, high charge densities, a polymer mixing ratio at which polymeric charges are present at a 1:1 ratio, and low salt concentrations are associated with the strongest tendency
for PEC formation (also see Figure 6).99,100 The main prerequisites for this kind of behavior seem to be the creation of soluble complexes with near-neutral charge and non-complementarity between macro-ions. Examples of these complexes include gelatins with varying isoelectric points, proteins containing synthetic or natural PEs, dendrimers with
PEs,101 and PEs containing micelles of surfactants with

opposite charges.102 Precipitation is going to happen if ion pairing is too efficient. One benefit of the system made up of PEs with oppositely charged surfactant micelles is that it allows for continuous variation of the micelle surface charge density
(σ, C nm−2) in a given sample using pH103 or mixed surfactant stoichiometry. Phase boundaries, which explain the formation of soluble complexes and coacervates at values of σ that depend on important electrostatic variables, such as ionic strength, I, and PE linear charge density, ξ, can be constructed
by tuning σ.104,105 The correlation between σc, I, and ξ that has been observed makes it easier to compare the experiment with
theories regarding polyelectrolyte−colloid interaction106,107
and inter-macro-ion condensation.62,108
Soon after Bungenberg de Jong’s ground-breaking studies,7 complex coacervation of solutions of biocolloids and synthetic
PEs was treated theoretically.61 It was implicitly assumed that the macro-ions could be treated as well-separated, highvalence, point-like particles in these early approaches and extensions that coupled FH theory with an additive DH electrostatic term. In the coacervate phase, where there is localized high polymer concentration above c*, such an assumption is categorically false. The earliest theories of
complex coacervation, particularly VO theory,61,109,110,110a,b,c attempted to add a term to the genuine FH description of polymer solution thermodynamics in order to account for the screened electrostatic interactions among polyions. Veis et
al.111 then developed theoretical models based on the theories
of Nakajima, Sato, and Tainaka.112,113 The complex coacervation in gelatin systems was characterized by the
Veis−Aranyi theory47 as a two-step phase separation. Electrostatic interactions are how charged molecules first interact with one another before aggregating. The newly formed aggregates, which were later identified as soluble intra-polymeric complexes, gradually rearrange over time to produce droplets known as coacervate. An intermediate step later confirmed and completed this theory. In order to create inter-polymeric complexes that are electrostatically neutral, the primary soluble complexes interact. These insoluble complexes eventually turn into coacervates, which get coarser as time goes on. The extended nature of PEs and the coupling between conformational and electrostatic degrees of freedom in a mixed PE
solution are taken into account by a more recent method based
on the RPA.114−116 However, these hypotheses are only applicable to weakly charged PEs at low salt concentrations, where local ion size and hydration details are largely irrelevant. The effects of pH on charged colloids have been studied using
methods similar to these.117 Most recently, it has been possible to examine the circumstances in which polymers with opposing charges produce complex coacervates using “field-theoretic”

Even scientists outside of the colloidal chemistry field, were drawn to complex coacervation because of their significance and exotic nature. Russian biologist A. I. Oparin, who made reference to Bungenberg de Jong’s work, mentioned the resemblance between proto-cells and coacervates and proposed that the first signs of life on Earth appeared as coacervate
droplets,120 and some recent studies are moving in the same
direction.121−125 He encapsulated his thoughts in the well
known book The Origin of Life.126 The main contention of this book was that life could have started inside of crystals that contained a wide variety of organic molecules. Oparin noted that even in diluted solutions, coacervates, which are meant to be tiny droplets of highly concentrated organic molecules, frequently form on their own. In light of this, he hypothesized that coacervation may have served as the mechanism by which a fluid phase separated in the “primordial soup”. Oparin and
colleagues127 showed chemical enrichment within the droplets, in situ enzymatic reactions, and droplet growth and fission resembling cellular life over the following few decades. However, this “metabolism first” strategy did not make a clear connection to the genetic evolution and information transmission via nucleic acids, which would have been crucial at the beginning of life. Additionally, their experiments made assumptions about the existence of massive macromolecules and polymers, which are unlikely to have existed in a pre-biotic setting (Figure 7). Coacervates need to be able to form from low-molecularweight molecules, especially nucleotides and their activated derivatives, in order to be viable protocells that can support both chemical and genetic evolution. Koga et al. first
demonstrated in 2011121 that nucleoside triphosphates (ATP), diphosphates (ADP, FAD, NAD), and monophosphates (AMP) could form coacervate microdroplets when combined with short (2−10 amino acid (aa)) lysine polypeptides (OLys), which could conceivably be produced
by pre-biotic processes.128,129 This study demonstrated that complexation of larger PEs bears many similarities to phase separation of low-molecular-weight ions. The increase in the critical concentration needed for coacervation (CCC) with decreasing negative charge from ATP > ADP > AMP, for instance, demonstrates the reliance on electrostatic interactions. They also found that increasing the molecular weight (MW) of PDADMAC from 150 to 275 kDa increased charge neutralization (with ATP) from 70 to 90%. These findings imply that more orientational freedom from longer polymer chains, decreased solubility, and increased hydrophobicity all contribute to higher charge neutralization at the CCC. Complex coacervates are water droplets dispersed in water that resemble MLOs. They are produced by spontaneous liquid−liquid phase separation (LLPS) of an aqueous solution

solution (Figure 8).68,76,130
Membrane-free or membraneless organelles (MLOs) are a broad category of subcellular bodies with sizes between 0.01
and 10 μm that do not have a lipid boundary.131−134 Nucleoli, Cajal bodies and paraspeckles in the nucleus, and processing bodies and stress granules in the cytoplasm are a few examples. These MLOs are dynamic, just like the synthetic coacervates, but they also seem to play a big role in important cellular functions like signaling, replication, the stress response, and illness. Numerous other distinguishing characteristics of those
bodies are that they are spherical, exhibit wetting, dripping, and fusion, and deform in flow. All these properties belong to liquids, and a growing body of research indicates that many MLOs are essentially liquid droplets formed by LLPS and distributed throughout the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm, though
some are also said to be gel-like solids.135 From a physicochemical perspective, the material characteristics (Figure 9) are among the most important factors to mimic
of MLOs since they influence not only the deformability and wetting behavior but also the uptake of client molecules through partitioning and catalytic properties. Many material properties are very similar, or at least have a similar range, between coacervates and MLOs, since both are typically formed by phase separation of macromolecules in solution,
driven by the same types of underlying interactions.136 Numerous parallels between MLO formation in cells and coacervate formation in vitro can be seen by looking at the hierarchical organization (Figure 10). The use of active processes by cells to achieve dynamic control over MLO assembly and disassembly is different,
though.137 In order to comprehend these control mechanisms, it is important to first understand how coacervates and numerous MLOs are formed within the framework of liquid phase separation. Mean-field FH theory is typically used to explain the in vitro condensation of chain-like macromolecules into a dense liquid phase, such as intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs):135

where the free energy F, the volume fraction φ, the chain length N, and the interaction free energy Fint are present. Using an efficient macromolecule−solvent interaction parameter χ, Fint is expressed as Fint = χφ (1 − φ) for simple coacervation. A DH approximation using the electrostatic interaction constant α can be used to express Fint for complex coacervation of polymers with the same length and charge density (σ) as Fint =
α (σφ)3/2. A first-order phase transition is predicted to occur when the interactions are strong enough (large negative χ, large α, or large σ), leading to the coexistence of two liquid

relative interaction strength (χ or ασ3/2), which is typically a function of temperature, pH, salt concentration, and the chemical groups in the macromolecules, determines the width
of the two-phase region.135
4. THEORETICAL MODELS
4.1. The Voorn−Overbeek (VO) Hypothesis and Empirical Evidence. A mathematical method for modeling complex coacervate phase behavior was devised by Overbeek and Voorn, based on the experimental results of Bungenberg de Jong. They treated gelatin/GA coacervation as a spontaneous occurrence. Coacervation was explained by them as a conflict between entropic forces, which tend to scatter charged molecules, and electrostatic forces, which tend to gather them. Together, the molecules with opposing charges produced a coacervate phase that ensnared solvent molecules. The coacervate phase’s solvent content allowed for a variety of potential molecular rearrangements, which increased the system’s entropy. Because of this, the coacervates were liquid in nature and could be completely reversed. The theory operated under multiple suppositions: (1) the molecules are arranged in a random chain; (2) solvent−solute interactions are small; (3) the interactive forces are distributive, causing the system to act as if the charges are free to flow; and (4) there is
no site-specific interaction between the molecules. This model uses a DH approximation for the ion energies in place of the enthalpic term, and it is based on the FH theory for polymer
solutions.17,138−140
For many years, the behavior of PE phases has been successfully predicted by this theoretical model, which is wellsupported by a substantial body of experimental research. For instance, Spruijt et al. used fluorescent measurements on PECs that were fluorescently labeled to ascertain the critical salt
content and the makeup of the coacervate phase.75 The VO model and the experimental data showed strong quantitative agreement. A ternary PEC system’s viscoelasticity and phase
behavior were examined by Priftis et al.65 The behavior changed dramatically when a third ingredient was added, showing a considerably greater tolerance to pH fluctuations and salt addition. The traditional VO model was adapted to predict these variations in phase behavior. The Larson group compared the conventional model with experimental data at a larger range of pH, salt, and chain length values in order to test
the limit of the VO hypothesis.141 They observed that the VO theory and the experimental data agreed well, but that the theory’s ability to generate reliable experimental predictions at high and low pH was hindered by the asymmetric association behavior between the polyanions and polycations. Despite these successes, the approximations in the DH electrostatic term cause VO to miss some physically significant contributions. Because most coacervates have high salt concentrations, the DH approximation assumes that the ions in solution are greatly diluted, which is inaccurate. Additionally, it treats polyions and salt as interchangeable while ignoring connection
in polymer chains.142 Notwithstanding these drawbacks, there is enough experimental agreement to support the widespread application of the VO model in the circumstances at hand. In its most basic version, the VO theory postulates that the two PEs have equivalent chain lengths and charge densities, that the PEs (and thus the counterions) are present in equal concentrations, and that the molecular volumes of the two types of monomers, the two types of counterions, and water
are all the same.99 In a symmetrical system with two components, only PEs and water are taken into account. The following describes the total free energy:

In this case, Ν, φp, and σ stand for the charge density, volume fraction, and polyelectrolyte degree of polymerization, respectively. The interaction parameter, α, is a measure of the electrostatic attractions between charged groups that is approximative. The φp window for phase separation and the compositions of the corresponding phases are revealed by analyzing the free energy function at fixed Ν and σ, as illustrated in Figure 11. Phase separation zones were defined as those where the free energy was concave with respect to the
total PE concentration, ∂2f/∂φ2 < 0. The treatment of a “three-component” system involves the addition of counterions to the PEs and water, while maintaining the same ionic strengths for the two PEs and the two salt ions, respectively. The complexation conditions of the system are significantly impacted by the addition or
Figure 10. MLOs’ hierarchical structure exacerbates the situation. The relative strength of the interfacial tension (γ), relative permittivity (εr), and density (ρ) are highlighted in the schematic illustration of
three experimentally discovered hierarchical arrangements (a).136 The
parameter α serves as a gauge for the domains’ relative sizes.55 The nucleolus (b, c), paraspeckles (d), and Cajal bodies (e) are just a few examples of the hierarchical organization found in MLOs. In contrast, many MLOs continue to be separated (f). Different electrolytes have been used in attempts to mimic these structures in coacervates. Examples include ssDNA (red)/PLys(Me)3 core coacervates in a ssDNA/GFP-K72 (green) outer coacervate phase (g), nested multiphase organization in the 2xRRASL peptide (green)/Prot (red)/pGlu (blue) coacervate system (h), and the pLys (green)/Qdextran (orange)/ss-oligo system (i); nested triple coacervates with an ATP/PAH inner core, encircled by a PSPMA/PDDA shell in a PAA/PDDA outer coacervate phase (j); multiphase coacervates with double cores, some of which appear partially wetted, as seen in the cases of PAH, Prot, 2xRRASL, PAA, pGlu, and polyU (k); and lensshaped domains and partial wetting in the case of pLys (red)/pAsp (green)/polyU coacervate system (l). Poly-uridylic acid (polyU), poly-L-glutamic acid (pGlu), and protamine sulfate (Prot) are examples of nonstandard abbreviations. Adapted with permission from ref 136. Copyright 2021, Elsevier Ltd.

removal of salt. As mentioned earlier, a higher concentration of salt can both decrease the entropic gain from counterion release and screen the electrostatic contacts between the PEs, so lowering the overall tendency for complexation.

φs in this case denotes the concentrations of counterions. Every component’s electrochemical potential in both phases must to be equal at equilibrium. Consequently, it is possible to derive a system of three equations with four unknowns (φp and
φs in each phase: φpI, φpII, φsI, and φsII). The compositions of both phases can be ascertained by fixing one of these
parameters, let’s say φsII, and then obtaining the other three
parameters, φpI, φpII, φsI. After completing those computations
for a range of φsII, Figure 12 shows the whole phase diagram.
Although the VO theory has well-known drawbacks, it offers a clear and effective framework for evaluating coacervate
systems.143 It should be mentioned that the coacervate phase is expected to have a higher concentration of salt than the supernatant, according to the VO theory. Contrary to popular belief, recent research indicates that the supernatant typically
contains more salt than the coacervate.144 This disparity results from the VO theory’s disregard for chain connectedness of charges and its exclusion of volume interactions. These interactions cause the PEC’s ions to be expelled, which raises
the system’s entropy and lowers the coacervate’s volume.143 The present theory of complex coacervation, which is discussed in the following section, was developed in response
to the challenge of fitting the more intricate systems.145
4.2. Experimental and Theoretical Findings on Modern Coacervate Phase Behavior. We limit our discussion here to a few pertinent examples that have quantified macrophase compositions and explored how PE molecular features effect PEC phase behavior, given the scope of publications studying PECs. Building on the initial work of
Spruijt et al.,75 a few investigations conducted recently compared the form of the binodal to a theoretical
model146,147 or simulation.148 Binodal phase diagrams for PAA and PDMAEMA PECs with N = 20, 50, 150, and 510
were published by Spruijt et al. in 2010.75 The amount of water and PAA in each phase was determined using fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the fluorescein-labeled PAA concentration in the supernatant. This information was then combined with measurements of the macrophase volume and coacervate dry mass. Phase diagrams including horizontal tie lines show the concentration of salt at which each sample was prepared (Cs,i). The authors assumed that salt concentrations (Cs) were equal in both phases and additive. To create a more sophisticated model of the behavior of PEC phases, using systematic variations in N, initial PE concentration (CP,i), and Cs,i, Li et al. created binodal phase diagrams for complexes of poly(L-lysine hydrochloride) and poly(sodium D,L-gluta
mate).144 The concentrations of Cs and PE (CP) in the supernatant and coacervate phases were determined by the authors using a combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), turbidity, and conductivity measurements. Combining turbidity measurements and OM allowed for the determination of salt resistance, which is a measure of the maximum Cs,i at a given CP,i where macroscopic phase separation still occurs. All of these studies showed that: (1) longer chains (i.e., greater N) result in denser complexes (i.e., higher CP) with higher critical salt concentrations (Cs,cr); (2) coacervates generated at a higher CP show less resistance to salt dissolving (i.e., less “selfsuppression”). Additionally, it is interesting that they discovered that the tie-lines sloped downward, defying the VO theory. The experimental phase diagrams deviated from
the VO theory17 due to the observation of salt partitioning preferentially into the supernatant phase and complexes having greater polymer densities than anticipated. For comparison
with Wang and Schlenoff’s results,149 Salehi and Larson147 employed an extended VO free energy model that takes into account counterion association−dissociation, cross-chain ion pairing, and charge management by considering each as a reversible chemical reaction. At low salt concentrations with a constant FH χ-parameter, their model predictions differed from the experimental binodal diagram of the strong PE system of poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and PDADMAC. Using an extended VO model, Lou et al. similarly incorporated ion

binding equilibria between small ions and polyions as well as
interchain ion-pairs between polycations and polyanions.146,150 A new system of homologous oppositely charged PEs based on a poly(acrylamide) main chain was compared to their revised model. With the inclusion of H2O2, this model could fit the binodal form with a single χ-parameter for each rising polarity, as illustrated in Figure 13. The homologous polymers, as
opposed to the PSS/PDADMAC or PAA/PDMAEMA systems, which have distinct local main chain structures and might produce various interaction parameters (solvation) within a FH or VO theory, are most likely what enabled this advancement. Beyond continuum theories, molecular modeling provides insight into the most difficult aspects of solvation,
hydration, and ion specificity.33,151 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with different charge spacing and hard-core omitted volume effects were employed by Radhakrisna et al. They came to the conclusion that the fortuitous cancellation of excluded volume and chain connectivity effects is what makes the VO theory work, based on their MC simulations and new predictions from
liquid state theory.16,142 The Perry group put these findings to the test by creating sequence-controlled polypeptides and analyzing their structure to find out how the exact positioning of charged monomers affected the phase behavior of PECs. They discovered that the condensed counterion cloud’s entropic release dominated the behavior and that it closely matched the phase behavior predicted by MC simulations, which incorporate excluded volume and�more importantly� charge spacing specificity. Modern theories of phase behavior become much more accurate when these factors are taken into
account.21,152 Proposals have been made for more complex versions of the VO model, which include effects like dipolar
interactions,153−155 dispersion interactions,75,141,156 concurrent
actions employing liquid-state correlation157,158 with blob

interspecies correlations,27,142,165 phase-to-phase salt partition
ing,37,142 and microphase structure creation.164 Focusing on the role of short-range charge interactions�as opposed to the long-range Coulomb forces present in the
original VO model�in complexation behavior has been a recurring subject in these developing methodologies. To comprehend the function of the polyelectrolyte charge
sequence in complicated coacervates, the Sing group166 created a theoretical framework. This methodology is based on a transfer matrix approach (also see Other Complex Theories Describing “Variables Driving Polyelectrolyte Complexation”
and “Effect of Polyelectrolyte Chirality”)64 where an effective energy ε(i) is used to explicitly account for the local electrostatic environment along a sequenced PE. The authors were able to capture the more subtle fluctuations in charge associated with non-regular sequences, as well as the effects of sequence in complex coacervates, such as charge fraction and charge blockiness. Moreover, the authors demonstrated good agreement between simulation, experiment, and theory for the large variety of sequences taken into consideration. The evolving physical picture shows that sequence blockiness and the number of charges per chain are trade-offs, but phase behavior is also strongly influenced by the relative positions of these blocks. A wide variety of PEs and bio-polyelectrolytes with charge sequence can be studied thanks to the computational, experimental, and theoretical work that goes into this project. The next step is to extend this theoretical framework to include other molecular interactions, like ion−π interactions, hydrogen bonding, and short-range χ-interactions and hydrophobicity. This is especially important for biological systems like IDPs, which are known to create sequencesensitive phase-separated structures in the cell. On the other hand, this could potentially provide insights into the phase behavior or self-assembly of soft materials and allow for the engineering of charge sequence in synthetic polymers.
4.3. Symmetrical Aggregate Model by Veis. According
to the VO theory,167,168 a rise in electrostatic free energy at the expense of a fall in mixing entropy drives the spontaneous formation of a concentrated coacervate phase. This model presupposes that there are (i) hardly any solvent−solute interactions, (ii) no site-specific interactions, and (iii) no
soluble complexes.99 We turn to the Veis et al. model because prior research on polyelectrolyte−micelle systems has demonstrated the existence of their soluble complexes and
aggregates.47 Veis identified the complex coacervation in gelatin systems as a two-step phase separation and modified the VO equations for complex coacervation and came to the conclusion that this happens in two steps: (i) the electrostatic interaction of oppositely charged PEs to form complexes of low configurational entropy (referred to as “aggregates”, a term we reserve for soluble species with more than two macro-ions), and (ii) the reorganization. The excess macro-ion may stay in the diluted phase if bulk stoichiometry does not coincide with local charge neutrality. System compositional polydispersity may enhance this “segregation” to achieve complex neutrality. Because of this, there are more alternatives for large multipolymer complexes with tunable stoichiometry (i.e., soluble aggregate), especially in polydisperse systems, whereas 1:1 soluble complexes can only approach neutrality provided some type of symmetry with regard to chain length and charge density. More macro-ions can be incorporated into the coacervate in this way. According to Veis’s description of “random” coacervates, random mixing should cause all traces of such multipolymer complexes to vanish. Veis has more recently thought about the possibility of symmetrical aggregates with different chains or excess charge densities.

Aggregates were present in both the equilibrium liquid and coacervate phases when the polyions were mixed at nonequivalent concentrations, according to the following models: (1) Polyion electrostatic equivalence was mandatory in the concentrated phase, while excess polyion stayed in the dilute
equilibrium liquid;169 (2) In mixtures that are pauci-disperse, coexisting distinct phases were divided up from the coacervate phase. (3) MW measurements revealed that the coacervate
phases displayed selection by MW or charge density.111 (4) The demand for electrostatic neutrality causes larger aggregates and, at higher mixing concentrations, lessens the intensity of coacervation so that the entire mixture remains as a single phase in heterogeneous chain length polyion mixtures. Figure 14 offers a schematic representation of the various options.
If an intensive variable like pH or ionic strength provides an additional impetus for coacervation, the dilute phase, which has stoichiometry that is more biased toward the macro-ion in excess, may still be vulnerable to further coacervation. MW fractionation of polydisperse polymers by reduction in solvent affinity via such as temperature may be analogous to the progressive depletion of dilute phase macro-ions achieved in this manner. According to the Veis model, the complex stability (tendency to resist dissociation) is primarily determined by the ionic strength, whereas the temperaturedependent enhancement of coacervation results from the positive entropy of chain mixing during coacervation. The Veis model’s lack of counterions likely overlooks a significant contribution to the entropy of coacervation.
4.4. Model by Nakajima−Sato. In a microsalt aqueous solution, Nakajima and Sato investigated an equivalent mixture of sulfated polyvinyl alcohol and aminoacetalyzed polyvinyl
alcohol.112 By adding the Huggins parameter and modifying the electrostatic term, they modified the VO theory. They did,
however, concur with VO that the charges ought to be regarded as equally distributed in both the concentrated and diluted phases. Both the theoretical and experimental results agreed well, and the study demonstrated that the VO model could still be applied to some systems.
4.5. Tainaka Theory. The Tainaka theory,113 which is an adaptation of the Veis−Aranyi theory, is the most recent model for complicated coacervation. The aggregates, which are present in both the concentrated and diluted phases, are generated without particular ion pairing, which is the primary distinction from the Veis−Aranyi model. The first phase’s biopolymer aggregates compress to create a coacervate. Tainaka states that when the molar mass and charge density of the polymers rise, the electrostatic and attraction forces between the aggregates get stronger and drive phase separation. For coacervation to happen, the polymer’s charge density and molar mass must be within a certain range. A concentrated gel or precipitate will form if the polymer’s charge density or molar mass rises above the critical range. This is because the aggregates’ long-range attractive forces will cause this to happen. Conversely, short range repulsive forces will stabilize the diluted solution and prevent coacervation for charge densities or molar mass below the range. Compared to all the other theories, the Tainaka theory is more general and can be applied to systems with high and low charge densities. For many systems, it offers a sufficient description of the intricate coacervation process. Apart from these theoretical frameworks, a plethora of practical investigations have predominantly concentrated on certain biopolymer systems (e.g., gelatin including carrageenan, chitosan, alginate, pectin, etc.) and endeavored to ascertain the
ideal coacervation parameters for every system scrutinized.171 Because the driving forces are electrostatic, the primary global factors affecting complex coacervation are (i) those associated with the intrinsic characteristics of the two biopolymers (MW, charge density, biopolymer ratios) and (ii) those associated with the media’s physicochemical characteristics (pH, ionic strength, temperature) (Figure 15C, also explained later in the text). Centrifugation can be used to recover the concentrated dense phase of coacervates following an associative phase separation and the ensuing coacervation (Figure 15D). The resulting coacervates can be applied in a variety of ways by fine-tuning and managing the ideal parameters for complicated coacervation.
5. FACTORS INFLUENCING THE COMPLEXATION OF POLYELECTROLYTES
5.1. Processing Polyelectrolyte Complexes. Numerous studies have been documented for various PEC systems; still, binary and ternary systems are the most prevalent types. Aqueous solutions of two oppositely charged PEs, such as
PDADMAC/PSS49 and PAH/PAA,80,85 are mixed to create binary PECs. Ternary PECs consist of three distinct PEs, two of which in an aqueous solution may have the same charge,
such as PVPE/PP/PSS175 and PAA/PDMAEMA/PEI or
PAA/PDMAEMA/PAH.65 In the literature currently in publication, binary systems predominate and are extensively
researched,80,85,149,175−183 whereas ternary systems are the
subject of fewer studies.65,175,184−186 The difficulty in reforming and adjusting PEC morphologies for intended uses has been one of the main obstacles preventing their widespread
deployment.176,187 Numerous attempts have been made to process PECs using various methods. In the early work,
Figure 14. Aggregated or molecular states can be represented by four different models. (A) Random chain model proposed by Voorn and Overbeek. (B) The initial Veis−Aranyi model, contradicted by data showing aggregates in the diluted phase. (C, D) The two Veis−Gates model possibilities. Symmetric aggregates and any extras of either polyion can be found in the dilute phase in both scenarios. The possibility of paired aggregates in the coacervate phases is different between panels C and D. Based on the fractionation data, it seems like the data best support model D.

Michaels and associates used combinations of organic solvents and water to create solutions, which were subsequently cast into films using conventional casting techniques, which involve
pumping the solvent off of plates.179,187−189 Later on, this approach would be used to create the well-known polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEMU)/layer-by-layer (LbL) technol
ogy.190−192 PEs have fuzzy superlattice topologies that promote non-crystallinity and homogeneity in their structures, similar to many other polymers, yet they are still conventional extensible macromolecules. These characteristics should make processing PECs for a wide range of possible applications
advantageous.176,190,191 Particularly, PECs derived from natural PEs have been proposed as drug delivery vehicles in a number of forms, including hydrogel beads, nano-/microparticles,
PEMU/LbL films, and cryogels.193 One significant issue with the PEMU/LbL process is the coating method’s unfeasibly sluggish build-up speed of the thin layer, particularly for layers thicker than approximately 1 μm, even with repeated
acceleration by spraying and/or spin assembly.179 Furthermore, it becomes difficult to modify a multilayer’s shape and other unusual traits once it has formed.
5.2. Stoichiometric and Non-stoichiometric Charge Interactions. In addition to polymer chemistry, physical
chemical parameters like ionic strength, temperature, pH, charge density, MW, and weight ratio of the two interacting PEs can be adjusted to alter the onset of complex
coacervation.194−196 Charge neutralization, which is crucial to coacervation, refers to both the microscopic and bulk charge stoichiometry of the inter-macro-ion complexes that spontaneously form. The bulk charge stoichiometry is defined as X = [+]/[−] at the macroscopic level, where [+] and [−] are the concentrations of uncompensated charges on the additional macro-ions (PEs, micelles, particles, etc.) in the mixture. At the microscopic or mesoscopic level, we define a charge stoichiometry originating from the intermolecular complexes as (x = Z+/Z−), where this ratio depends on the components of the complexes themselves, excluding any surrounding counterions. Even if X and x are only exactly identical in the absence of free macro-ions, the maximal phase separation observed when the former is close to unity indicates their close proximity. The stoichiometry of complex coacervation in a chitosan (Ch)−gum odina (GO) system can be clearly observed in Figure 16. This condition, and consequently the two-phase state, can be approached by altering the weight mixing ratio or by changing the molecular charge of one macro-ion, most commonly by pH adjustment, or by

increasing the inter-macro-ion binding affinity, for example, by
reducing ionic strength.6,197,198 As the two-phase region approaches, there have been relatively few systematic studies of the evolution of species in the one-phase region. This is partly because it is challenging to eliminate kinetic effects when coacervation is achieved by a mixing process. At an experimentally well-defined temperature, Tφ, polyelectrolyte−micelle systems seem to exhibit rather unusual thermally induced coacervation. This temperature, Tφ, is influenced by the ratio of total surfactant to polymer as well
as the ratio of ionic to non-ionic surfactants.199 It also depends on the mixed micelle charge, ionic strength, polymer MW, and X. It can therefore be altered for study convenience. The majority of models assume that macro-ion complexes form charge-neutral aggregates at a 1:1 stoichiometry. According to
Zhang and Shklovskii,200 “intercomplex or intracomplex disproportionation” (charge segregation) may lead to nonstoichiometric coacervation. A neutral coacervate drop and a more highly charged aggregate coexist when there is intercomplex disproportionation in the charged aggregate due to polycation migration. Contrarily, in intracomplex disproportionation, excess charges migrate to the “tail” of a partially neutral aggregate. Figure 17 demonstrates the effect of non-stoichiometric charge ratios between the PE species. According to other reports, the interaction is not always at 1:1 stoichiometry as would be predicted in an ideal situation, even when equal parts of oppositely charged PEs are combined
together.177,201 This is because in certain regions of the PECs, kinetic constraints lead to topological restrictions that are harmful to the development of cross-links. Extrinsic dopings may make up for these kinetically limited sites, which could leave some residual doping sites in the polymer matrices (Figure 3). Porcel and Schlenoff conducted elemental analysis
on the dried PEC after carefully rinsing it in pure water, and then synthesized PSS/PDADMAC in 2.5 M NaCl to elaborate
on this phenomena.177 The sulfur and nitrogen molar ratio was determined to be 1.17:1 PSS/PDADMAC, indicating a molar excess of 17% of PSS over what would be predicted for a balanced 1:1 ratio. Even though they anticipated that every ionic group in the PDADMAC would be involved in the crosslinks, ejecting every chloride ion from the PEC system, the scientists also detected a trace amount of chloride in the
elemental analysis.177 The PEC stoichiometry was shown to be influenced by the order and pace of mixing in addition to the ionic strength of the mixed PE solutions in a related work that
used the identical binary PSS/PDADMAC system.201 Additionally, it was found that PDADMAC was more easily soluble

in the doping NaCl solution than PSS, which resulted in the migration of more PSS into the complex phase and the drawing of more PDADMAC into the supernatant phase. Therefore, it was determined that there might be some thermodynamic preference for PSS in the complex in addition to the kinetic control. The excess PSS, according to the authors, either existed at non-stoichiometric extrinsic sites or as free chains that were imprisoned in the aqueous pores, or vacuoles, that were formed inside the PEC structure as
illustrated in Figure 18a.201 The phenomenon was suggested to
be a desirable property of bio-implants to facilitate the movement of nutrients, implying the use of the generated
saloplastics as cartilage substitutes.201,202 According to a different investigation, complexation by uneven charge interactions may have occurred in PECs with one component in excess abundance because the amount of the excess component observed in the supernatant phase was much less than that which would be predicted for a balanced
stoichiometry.80 One can presume that these non-stoichiometric charge interactions occur when a single chain of the less abundant component interacts with many chains of the excess abundant component. Because of the complex’s nonstoichiometric interactions, the amounts of polycations and polyanions detected in the aqueous supernatant phases in Figures 18 (a) and (c) may be significantly lower. Nonetheless, couples of polycation−polyanion and counterion−PE preserve
overall charge neutrality.203 Hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding also facilitate non-stoichiometric PEC forma
tion.35,204,205 PECs with comparable phase characteristics and intermolecular interactions can arise from hydrogen bonds
formed between oppositely charged PEs.35,204
5.3. Interaction Forces Driving Polyelectrolyte Complexation. The most researched kind of weak electronic interactions that can cause associative liquid−liquid phase separation are dipole interactions, π−cation, π−π, and metal
coordination.135 The several interactions that could result in
the creation of coacervates based on peptides are depicted in Figure 19.
However, complex coacervation caused by non-specific electrostatic associations has received the greatest attention. In electrostatic systems, macromolecular ionizable groups cause the LS to be sensitive to ionic strength and pH. Small adjustments to these factors may cause the liquid phase to
dissolve or solidify.208 Only a small number of studies have examined the impact of integrating electrostatics with other interactions to date. For instance, a number of studies from the Tirrell and de Pablo groups discussed the possibility of hydrogen bonds forming during complexation between the
backbones of polypeptides with opposing charges.56,209,210 In a different work, Hyman, Alberti, and Pappu showed a hierarchy of interactions causing phase separation through mutagenesis
studies of the FUS family of IDPs.211 Although phase separation was generally improved by electrostatic effects, the distribution of cation−π interactions between arginine and phenylalanine residues affected the coacervate’s material properties in a way that made sense given the theory of
associative polymers.212,213 Precisely, here the function of several interactions in maintaining multiphasic condensates was explored, and it was noted that the multiphasic compartmentalization of proteins is largely dependent on their aromatic and arginine content. Biomolecular condensates frequently contain multiphasic structures, which are hypothesized to have significant effects on how several chemical reactions are arranged inside of a single compartment. Biomolecular multiphasic condensates are widely used, although little is known about the molecular

mechanisms underlying their thermodynamic immiscibility. Phase separation often requires weak multivalent attractive
interactions.214−222 It has been demonstrated that multiphasicity arises when competing contacts for a common binding partner occur and when the total interaction strengths
in two phases differ enough to make them immiscible.55,223−230 One interesting finding is that RNA is present in every multiphasic condensate that has been seen in cells thus far, in
addition to proteins.231−233 Associative electrostatic interactions with positively charged residues like lysine (K) and arginine (R), π−π stacking interactions with aromatic residues like tyrosine (Y) and phenylalanine (F), and cation−π interactions with arginine are among the relevant stabilizing interactions that RNA nucleobases can form in protein−RNA condensates. To varying degrees, each of these contacts aids in the stability of the condensate, and the predominant form of interaction for a particular protein−RNA sequence may be the cause of the compositional demixing that gives rise to multiphasic structures. More precisely, it has been demonstrated that arginine is particularly prevalent in proteins that
bind RNA.232,233 Because arginine has a positive charge, it can bind with RNA through both a cation−π and direct Coulomb contact. It is interesting to note that arginine and lysine are known to contribute differently to biomolecular phase separation, despite having an alkyl side chain with nitrogen
functionalization and being positively charged at physiological
pH.216,224,234−236
Not only are the cation−π interactions generated by arginine with aromatic rings (RNA bases) less sensitive to screening by counterions in solution, but they are also stronger than those
formed by lysine.234,235,237,238 The increased hydrophobicity of
arginine224,234,239,240 and the less favorable free energy of
hydration of arginine241 as well as the hybrid cation−π/π−π
nature of the bonds arginine forms with π-rich species234,242 have been used to explain this uneven behavior of arginine vs lysine. As evidenced by multiple investigations, changing the amino acid arginine to lysine in protein sequences significantly
destabilized condensates,236,243 although raising the arginine
fraction promoted phase separation.211 It has to be seen if arginine has a comparable impact in multiphasic condensates of protein and RNA mixtures. One of the obvious gaps in the literature is the critical role of RNA in stabilizing biomolecular
condensates.244,245 Systems undergoing complex coacervation include pairs of colloid and colloid as well as polyelectrolyte− polyelectrolyte and polyelectrolyte−colloid. Complex coacervation is driven by two forces: entropic contributions from the loss of small ions and enthalpic contributions from longrange inter-macro-ionic electrostatic interactions. Carlsson et
al.246 investigated the complexation in model systems made up of negatively charged PE and protein models (representing lysozyme in an aqueous environment) using MC simulations. The authors demonstrated how protein−polyelectrolyte association and cluster formation were enhanced by nonelectrostatic protein−protein attraction. Both enthalpic (primarily caused by the surface characteristics of aggregates) and entropic (primarily due to the polydispersity in size and molecular mass) factors could be taken into account to explain
this effect.167,247 Nonetheless, a number of experi
ments66,248−250 and computational studies251−253 contend that complex coacervation has a significant positive entropic contribution. This could be due to the counterions’ increased translational entropy as a result of complexation. Ou and
Muthukumar252 have looked into the driving force behind
polyion complexation using computer simulations. They used Langevin dynamics simulations to study uniformly charged polyions in a continuum solvent. They started with the two polyions at a great distance from one another, then they let them complex and computed the energy change, which they determined to be the process’s internal energy change. Then, using thermodynamic integration and the entropy change resulting from the difference between the Helmholtz free energy and the internal energy, the Hemholtz free energy
change was computed.210,254 The primary finding of this work was that, for weakly charged polyions (ξ), the driving force was energetic (ξ <1) but become entropic for strongly charged
polyions (ξ > 1). Rathee et al.251 have reported findings that are comparable for associatively charged polyions, in which chemical equilibrium conditions dictate the charge state. PECs that are highly hydrated typically have a lower critical
solution temperature (LCST),255−257 as noted in recent
studies on tau protein/RNA255 and ε-poly-L-lysine/hyaluronic
acid (HA)256 LCST behavior is consistent with calorimetric tests that demonstrate almost athermal (ΔH ≈ 0) coacervation, suggesting that entropy gain(s) play a key role
in driving coacervation.258,259 On the basis of this, Han, Shea, Fredrickson, and associates identified the coacervation-causing factor as the release of overlapping hydration waters from
PEs,255,256 which is amplified at high temperatures because the hydration shells surrounding PEs weaken. Polymers become more hydrophobic as hydration liquids are released, which increases coacervation. Usually, a temperature-dependent
expression for χPW captures this impact.255,260 Entropy gain through counterion release is the most widely accepted
explanation for coacervation, despite its chemically specific
influence.18,56,64,147,187,249,251,252,261,262 Notwithstanding the
foregoing discussion, both release mechanisms emphasize the necessity of incorporating local interactions into coacervation theory since water binding, like ion binding, to a PE-monomer
is local and chemically specific.37 On the other hand, we observe that some PECs have also exhibited UCST behavior. However, the PEs that make up these PECs are extremely hydrophobic and have a large number of directly contacting ion pairs (i.e., no mediation waters of hydration) between
polyanion and polycation.257,263,264 In a nutshell, the ionic strength of the solution has a significant impact on both the enthalpic and entropic contributions, each of which may be significant. A cloud of counterions surrounds a PE chain. The concentration of ions surrounding the polyion is higher than the concentration of bulk ions at low ionic strengths. As a compromise between Coulombic attraction and counterion entropy, the large Debye length results in diluted counterion clouds. When a polymer with opposite charges is added, tight complexation causes the counterions to be released into the solution (entropy gain) and brings the charges closer together (Coulombic attraction; exothermic). The addition of and complexation with the second polymer, on the other hand, becomes endothermic at high ionic strength because the counterion clouds are denser (Figure 20). However, the entropy increase brought on by counterion release causes a net energy increase in complex formation.

PEs, the repeating units maintain their charge throughout the
whole pH range, which is between pH 1 and 14.268,269 Strong PEs have their charges fixed to specific places on the polymer, whereas weak PEs can anneal in reaction to the local energy
environment, transferring charges across ionizable groups.270 Weak PEs exhibit intriguing charge-driven behavior due to this characteristic, especially when charge repulsions and adhesion compete to dictate molecule configurations. The fraction of charged sites on an individual molecule is dispersed at the pKa (or pKb) to optimize adhesive interactions, which causes the polymer to assume compact shape. For large polymers, these conflicting interactions lead to a sharp first order coil to
globule transition.271,272 Smart, pH-sensitive membranes have also been developed using similar effects of pH on chain
conformation (see below).273 If enough salt is added, the ion pairs that form in PECs�regardless of how strong or weak they are�can be broken and/or reversed (a procedure known
as “doping”; see “pH and Charge Density”).176,178,274 The mechanical characteristics and chain dynamics (mobility) of the complexes are primarily determined by the kind of
salt and its concentration in the aqueous phase.49,275 In other words, for various PEC systems, different salts exhibit varying doping levels. In increasing order of concentration, the additional salt induces a phase transition from rigid complexes to soft rubbery complexes, fluid-like coacervates, and ultimately
uniform solutions.56,80,85,276,277 Furthermore, the complexation process can be significantly influenced by the valence states of
the salt ions that are present in the system.58,278 In general, the complex size and charge density of anionic salt ions rise in tandem with an increase in their valence state. This is because the anionic salt ions carry more charges than other salt ions,
leading to a larger charge density in the solution.279 The impact of cationic valence state on PEC size is more intricate and contingent upon other circumstances, including the particular PEs implicated and the concentration of salt ions within the solution. Designing and improving PEC-based materials for a range of applications can be aided by an
understanding of how salt ion valence affects complex
ation.280,281
As discussed above, in combination with the water present during extrusion, doping causes ionic cross-links to break and
plasticizes the complex.282 It was observed that the combination of heat and salt in these “saloplastic” materials allowed for the addition of more salt to be dissolved at a lower
temperature.176 While temperature is a widely recognized factor in the processing of polymers (thermoplastics), salt doping is exclusive to PEs. PECs, which are typically regarded as “unprocessable”, could be dissolved in ternary solvents made of a combination of water, organic solvent, and salt, according to Michaels and colleagues’ comprehensive investigation of
PEC characteristics in the 1960s.187,283 It is likely that the solutions were essentially unpaired PEs that could be formed into films using conventional casting methods. PEC mem
branes were thus proposed for various applications,187 many of
which were similar to those proposed for PEMUs.190 These applications included fuel cell membranes, ultrafiltration, dialysis membranes, battery separators, membranes for fuel cells, electrically conductive coatings, and medical devices such as chemical sensors and contact lenses. Over the past few years, the study of PECs has shown promise. Among its practical applications has been drug
delivery (see “Delivery Platforms”),284 where pH-responsive complexes may provide even more target-specific tuning for
drug delivery.285−287 For instance, when the core is removed, drug molecules may be deposited into PE capsules made by LbL deposition of oppositely charged PEs surrounding a
charged core template.288 Since the properties of these capsules rely on the PE layers that make them up, weak PECs that exhibit stimuli-responsive charging behavior can be employed to adjust a capsule’s stability at a desired pH. Moreover, these capsules may potentially contain biologically
produced compounds to improve biocompatibility.289 Shen
and colleagues290 described one effective use of doxorubicinloaded bovine serum albumin (BSA) gel capsules for the prevention of lung melanoma growth. Excellent pH-controlled loading and release characteristics were shown by these
capsules. Furthermore, Anandhakumar et al.285 used LbL assembly of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) to create a PE thin multilayer biocompatible film containing epithelial cells. BSA and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride were put onto the film, and the amount of release was adjusted by adjusting the ambient parameters, such as pH and ionic strength. Weak PEs are important in many areas; specifically, they have been studied as “smart” materials for drug delivery and chemical separations. Dynamic charges on weak PEs lead to polymer chains adopting distinct equilibrium conformations even in response to slight environmental changes. Because of their tunable charges and pH- and salt-responsive qualities, weak PEs have emerged as intriguing options for controlling the material properties of PE
coacervates for a wide range of applications.290 Furthermore, weak polyelectrolyte complexation may be used to deliver genes by taking advantage of the lysosome’s pH de
crease,291−293 which allows for the simple release of medicines and other polypeptides in addition to genetic material within the cell. Even though weak PEs are frequently employed in
applications,294 a thorough conceptual understanding linking their charging characteristics to the impact of other environmental conditions has not yet been developed. Our capacity to design and optimize a PE system’s behavior for a particular activity is hampered by its absence. We have an excellent tool for understanding the physical mechanics of

polyelectrolytes during counterion condensation265 and release at the
expense of their translational entropy.266,267 If two polyelectrolytes with opposing charges localize around one another, they can regain this translational entropy and eliminate the need to localize small molecule ions.

charging in weak PEs: molecular simulations. Strong PEs are the subject of a large body of theoretical and computational literature, and their behavior in diluted and semi-dilute conditions�both with and without the addition of salt-is
well studied.295,296 Less research has been done on the behavior of complexing oppositely charged PEs; instead, it has mostly concentrated on highly idealized models in solutions containing monovalent salts, allowing comparison to con
tinuum theoretical results.252,297,298 Recently, there has been a surge in interest in this scenario (complex coacervation or LbL assembly, depending on the strength of electrostatic coupling that drives phase separation), driven by the novel phase separation and response properties
that could be utilized, such as drug delivery capsules299−303 and underwater adhesives (see the “Applications” sec
tion).304−306 The use of weak or low-charge-density PEs is crucial for coacervating phases because strong PEs with densely arranged charges have a tendency to form solid
aggregates rather than fluid phases.80,85,307 It is essential to comprehend the charging behavior of weak PE systems, especially in dense and confined circumstances, in order to accurately define and manage these phases. In an experimental
study by the Whitmer group,308 the authors used coupled molecular dynamics and MC simulations to clarify the new interaction between weak PE charging and complexation behavior. The authors specifically looked into a model of two

equal-length polymer chains that charge oppositely in an implicit salt solution that is represented by DH interactions. The presence and degree of cooperativity in charging and complexation are assessed by varying the charging tendency of each chain and the concentration of salt. At large Debye lengths, which correspond to low salt concentrations, strong cooperation in the charging of these chains is observed; at lower Debye lengths, which correspond to higher salt concentrations, the chains appear to behave in isolation. It was discovered that a highly charged chain greatly encourages the charging of its partner chain when the electrostatic coupling is long-ranged, even when the environment is not conducive to an isolated form of that partner chain. A decrease in the system’s potential energy, which does not happen at the lower Debye lengths where potential energies and charge fractions converge for all partner chain charging tendencies, provides evidence for this phenomenon. Better predictions for the dissociation point of delivery complexes will be made possible by this partnership, which will aid in the development of “smart” drug delivery methods.
A PAA/PAH system was used by Chollakup et al.85 to study the impact of ionic strength on coacervation. Figure 21 displays ternary phase diagrams for the three NaCl concentrations in the PAA/PAH coacervate system. It is clear that precipitation happens at greater concentrations of PAA and PAH, and that at low concentrations, no coacervate formation is seen at 100 mM NaCl. There is a small precipitation region and a coacervate region at 400 mM NaCl. Coacervation is seen at 1500 mM NaCl without precipitation. Nonetheless, solution creation is evident in every instance. It is essentially an electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged colloidal particles that is susceptible to salt screening. Many studies have looked into how ionic strength affects coacervation for various coacervates that form pairs. Several studies have suggested that higher salt concentrations, or ionic strength, may prevent the production of complex coacervates and even aid in their dissolution. Salt’s influence on complex coacervation may be explained by the screening effect of the extra salt between the charge groups of the oppositely charged PEs. It is well known that the chargescreening effect reduces the Debye length and the ability of oppositely charged PEs to interact. The electrostatic contact between the polycation and polyanion is reduced when the ionic strength is increased. The net driving force for complexation, however, disappears above a critical salt concentration, and complex coacervation no longer occurs. The chemical nature of the ingredients can also have an impact on the energy balance in addition to salt content. Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond formation are frequently
additional driving forces to electrostatic interactions.77 When these additional interactions are present in PEs, coacervation increases the entropic and enthalpic contributions of complex
ation, raising the critical salt concentration.54,309 In a different study, PAA and PDMAEMA in a stoichiometrically balanced ratio were examined to determine the impact of salt
concentration and chain length.75 The position of the critical salt concentration, for which phase separation was no longer seen, was shown to shift with increasing chain length, and longer chains were found to have wider coexisting phase regimes. In a different study, Wang and Schlenoff found that KBr could successfully change the PEC system’s phase that
involved PSS and PDADMA.149 This study examined the
dimensions of PEs in PECs, varying the concentration of salt to go from solids to coacervates to liquids. The PDADMA/ PSS complex’s phase diagram may be traversed by KBr on its own without the need to adjust for temperature or polymer concentration. The samples were subjected to two different treatments: (i) 30 days of no annealing storage and (ii) 3 hours of annealing at 60 °C, followed by a cooling period to ambient temperature and 10 days of storage. Coacervates developed between 1.4 and 1.8 M KBr, while tough to rubbery PECs were
present up to 1.4 M KBr.149,179 In order to explain the possible behavior of the polymer chains during the network’s transition from solid to liquid, two theories were put forth (Figure
22).310 According to the first theory, the PEC swells equally
with salt and water, and the polymer chains extend into the new volume that doping creates (Figure 22B). In the second case, as the excess volume is excluded to a more polymer-poor phase (Figure 22C), the polymers stay compacted. In all scenarios, the polymers’ minimal connectivity is preserved. Bediako et al. carried out a more thorough investigation in which they treated PECs made with 0.2 M solutions of PDADMAC and PSS with KBr in the range of 0.5−2.5 M to examine the related phase shifts as functions of salt at room
temperature.275 At KBr concentrations less than 1.0 M, it was discovered that the PECs remained as rigid complexes. The samples showed modest alterations and a soft, rubbery appearance between 1.0 and 1.6 M KBr. Liquid-like coacervates formed between 1.7 and 1.9 M KBr, while full solutions were seen at 2.0 M and higher. By raising the concentration of salt, the electrostatic contact between the oppositely charged groups was diminished, leading to fast
chain mobility inside the PECs.149,275,311 As a result, two crucial salt concentrations were found, 1.6 and 1.9 M KBr, respectively, for the complex-to-coacervate and coacervate-to
solution phase transitions.275 These essential salt concentrations varied significantly depending on the initial PE

with increasing PE concentrations.275,312 Ghostine et al.49 examined a variety of other salts, such as sodium bromide (NaBr), sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), sodium chlorate (NaClO3), sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium iodide (NaI), sodium acetate (NaCH3COO), and sodium perchlorate (NaClO4). The rate and degree of diffusion of these salts based on Hofmeister anion into an extruded saloplastic PEC of PSS/PDADMAC were assessed by the authors. Sadman et al. have shown that the hydrophobicity of the quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine) (QVP) can be changed to alter the mechanical tunability of PSS and QVP
complexes (PSS:QVP-C1, C2, and C3 complexes).54 Figure 23
shows that PSS:QVP complexes exhibit liquid-like behavior at high salt concentrations and low frequencies and behavior that resembles a power-law at high salt concentrations and high frequencies. Previous reports for a range of PE systems have shown
similar effects.313−315 It is exceedingly difficult to get higher frequency response using time−salt superposition, as done in Figure 23, since coacervates of strong PEs created at low salt concentrations take many months to equilibrate. Nonetheless, the higher frequency response can be probed by using a low salt concentration coacervate and doing a time−temperature superposition.
5.4.2. pH and Charge Density. Phase separation typically produces flocculates and/or precipitates rather than coacervates if the linear charge density of the PE is high enough and the charges on the polymer chain are fixed (quenched, not
ionizable).7 Coacervates have higher water content than other compounds because extra small ions have been hydrated. Coacervates have several advantages over precipitates, including the ability to be handled more easily and lower interfacial tension due to their macroscopically homogeneous and cohesive fluid. Phase separation is frequently explained as the result of aggregated complexes becoming insoluble. We must keep in mind that, in addition to entropic contributions, the stability of mixed biopolymer dispersions is greatly influenced by the balance between biopolymer−biopolymer and biopolymer−solvent interactions. It was previously discovered that phase separation occurred when the net charge
of inter-polymer complexes was close to 0.316 The Veis−Aranyi
theory47 states that coacervation is supported by attractive interactions between biopolymers and weak interactions
between biopolymers and solvents. Strong attractive interactions cause the formation of neutral aggregated complexes, which leads to low aggregated complex−solvent interactions
and phase separation. In spite of this, according to Xia et al.317 complexes made of protein−polycationic polymers were the only ones where neutrality was required at phase separation; it was not a general rule. Phase separation for complexes with a negative total charge occurred for protein−polyanionic polymers. No justification was given. Because the most salt bonds form when the pH is adjusted to a point where equivalents of the two PEs’ oppositely charged molecules are present, this is when the best conditions for complex coacervation are achieved. After several authors proposed that the coacervate phase could behave either like an elastic gel or like a concentrated solution (viscous behavior), the intriguing question of the coacervate phase’s rheological characteristics was first raised a few years ago. The storage (or elastic modulus) G′ and the loss (or viscous modulus) G′′ are the two terms most frequently used to describe the
viscoelastic response:6

(5)
The shear stress’s “in-phase” reaction to the material’s periodic,
amplitude γ0 shear strain is described by the storage modulus G′, which is essentially a cosinusoidal response, and the loss modulus G′′ describes the “out-of-phase” response, which is associated with the material’s capacity to release energy (i. e., an oscillatory response). The phase angle difference between the applied strain and the resultant stress δ and a complex modulus G* can also be used to express these two material
functions:318

In terms of rheology, the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G′′) are G′(ω) > G′′(ω) for elastic gel and G′′(ω) > G′(ω) for viscous fluid (sol state). Figures 24a and 24b make this abundantly clear: at a given strain percentage in the linear viscoelastic region, the values of G′ and G′′ were noticeably

different, indicating a predominance of elastic properties in the coacervate systems composed of Ch and gum from the odina PEC. The coacervate (1:5) formed at pH 4.5 exhibits the highest elastic mechanical response, according to the frequency
sweep curves (Figure 24c).6 It is reported that an elastic solid state (gel) contains an infinite network while a viscous fluid state (sol) contains only finite branched clusters. The network can originate from noncovalent interactions like electrostatic/ionic interactions, helical domains, microcrystalline bundles, hydrogen bonding, coordination, crystallization, hydrophobic effect, and so on (physical or reversible gels) or from covalent structure
(chemical or irreversible gels).6 Both liquid complex coacervates (polyelectrolyte coacervates, PECOVs) and solid precipitation (polyelectrolyte complexes, PECOXs) have been reported in reports on the phase behavior of complexation, and recent efforts have attempted to better elucidate these relationships between PECOXs and PECOVs. It is now understood that the salt and water content of a PECOX in contact with aqueous solution controls all of its properties. The
ion pair (Pol+Pol−) that exists between two charged monomer units is the fundamental unit of interaction in a PEC. When salt is added, these interactions break down, changing “intrinsic” charge compensation to “extrinsic”, in which PE
segments are paired with and compensated by M+ and A−, two
salt counterions:42,176,276

acknowledging [Pol+A−] = [Pol−M+]. Since Pol+Pol− pairs are physical cross-links that can be broken by salt, their strong dependence on density serves as a good illustration of saltcontrolled properties in PECOXs. When the salt “doping” in eq 8 is pushed to its breaking point, PE chains become
completely dissociated from one another.75,57,319 PEs should be associated very loosely up until this crucial dissociation point. These coacervates, which are actually weakly associated PECs, connect the entire spectrum of the same associated PEs, from complex to coacervates, when combined with salt. The crossover point between loss and storage modulus was found
to be the boundary between complex and coacervate states.6 A variety of experimental techniques, including turbidimetric
titration,316,320−325 quasi-elastic and static light scatter
ing,316,317,320−322,325 and electrophoretic light scattering,317,325 were used to highlight structural and morphological transitions in polymer−polymer and protein−polyelectrolyte dispersions. pHc and pHφ, two remarkable pH values that correspond to morphological and structural changes, were discov
ered.320,322,323 The critical pH, pHc, is related to the primary complexation of macromolecules and the formation of intrapolymeric complexes. It is determined by a slight increase in scattered light intensity in dispersion. On a molecular level, the pHc can be viewed as a phase transition. The pH is determined by a significant rise in dispersion turbidity, which, according to the majority of authors, denotes the beginning of microscopic phase separation and the formation of coacervate droplets. In addition to the already established two pH values, light scattering and spectrophotometric measurements were used by
Kaibara et al.320 to establish other distinctive pH transitions on BSA-PDADMAC dispersions. At pHc, soluble primary complex formation began, and at “pH′crit”, it was finished. The formation of quasi-neutralized primary complexes may result in a subsequent increase in scattering intensity at “pHpre”. Since the spectrophotometric data and pH values remained constant after the titration of the BSA-PDADMAC dispersion was interrupted, the pH region between pH′crit and pHpre was identified as the region of stable intra-polymer complexes. The first microscopic observation of coacervate droplets and the appearance of turbidity both occurred at pHφ, which coincided with a peak in scattering intensity. In contrast to the definition given earlier, the pHφ in this instance indicates a late stage of phase separation because droplets have already formed. Phase contrast microscopy revealed that coacervates underwent morphological changes at “pHmorph” before changing into solid or flocculant substances at “pHprecip” (Figure 25).
Prior to this investigation, every examination of the kinetic mechanism of phase separation on numerous polymer− polymer and protein−polymer systems, as well as on a smaller number of protein−polysaccharide systems, indicated that pHc and pHφ were the most significant pH of structural
transitions.321,326−328 This description of the various transitions in the protein−polymer phase separation process seems incomplete, especially in light of the fact that soluble intrapolymeric complexes must interact to form roughly neutral aggregated (inter-polymeric) complexes prior to phase separation. More than two pH values corresponding to

structural transitions should be expected during the complexation of biopolymers. The critical area that lies between complexation and phase separation presents a significant challenge in particular. More in-depth data on the composition of the various entities formed and the energy of assembly are also required, using sophisticated calorimetric techniques and high-resolution cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM), for example. Subsequently, we might question if these forces dictate a particular structure of coacervates; since we are, at least initially, working with liquid phases that might ultimately reach quite different destinations, it is impossible to discuss an intrinsic common structure. Yet, there have been initiatives to use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques to record three-dimensional structural elements. By using cryogenic temperature high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (cryo-HRSEM), for instance, a unique
“sponge structure” in droplets was identified (Figure 26).329
While theoretical treatments of coacervation have explored few of these parameters, an understanding of how these parameters control, among other things, the onset of phase separation would be necessary for the design of new materials based on coacervates. According to Voorn and Over
beek,17,99,168 coacervation can only occur above a certain charge density and/or chain length. However, the model by
Tainaka330 suggests that if the charge density is too high or the chain length is too long, precipitation rather than coacervation will occur, and for very low charge densities and short chain lengths, a stable solution (single phase) will result. The “dilute phase aggregate model” created by Veis and Aranyi provides a better treatment for experimental systems with significantly
lower critical charge densities and chain lengths.47 While the suppression of coacervation at low salt concentrations is not predicted by any of these early models, it is predicted at high
ionic strengths.331 The mechanism of coacervation has also
been the subject of recent theories. A theory332 for weak PEs states that when the difference in pK values between the polyacid and polybase groups was reduced, the degree of coacervation increased. The stability diagrams for the coacervation of gum arabic with gelatin are consistent with this result. Numerous authors have extensively examined the chemical pathways and circumstances leading to the complex
coacervation of PEs.80,85,159,321,333−338 However, the impact of polymer−solvent interactions on complex phase behavior has only been the subject of a small number of theoretical and
simulation investigations.141,159 Sato and Nakajima calculated the limiting conditions of charge density and chain length for complexation and incorporated the Flory interaction parameter χ to account for interaction between water and PE salt in the
classical VO theory.339,340 Larson and colleagues147,150 expanded the VO theory to account for the unusually high salt resistances of PECs measured in acidic environments. They did this by adding the χ parameter between solvent molecules and protonated PAA. Also, Spruijt et al. incorpo
rated the χ parameter in their calculations using the VO theory to characterize the experimentally determined polymer
contents in PECs.75 For a chain length of 1, Figure 27
predicts that complexation will occur if χr > 0. It demonstrates that for χr = 0.1, the right critical salt concentrations are predicted using a mapping of the associative phase separation onto the segregative phase separation. A slightly more hydrophobic polymer may have a much higher critical salt concentration for similar chain lengths because of the great reliance of the critical salt concentration on the choice of χr. The majority of synthetic PECs that have been examined so far have focused on fully or strongly charged PEs, or those in
which all or most of the monomer units are ionized.341 This is why there is still a dearth of experimental research on the function of PE linear charge density or the proportion of ionic monomers f (charge density or charge fraction) in PE complex coacervation. In addition, theoretical research indicates that f can be utilized to adjust the PEC phase’s density and internal structure, as well as the binodals of the associative phase
separation.29,31,159,342 A noteworthy exception is the Laaser group’s recent experimental study of the effects of polarity and PE charge percentage on PEC phase behavior. It was demonstrated by the use of optical turbidity that salt resistance was remarkably unresponsive to comonomer hydrophobicity in that range of charge densities, although it did decrease with
lowering f (down to f = 0.67).343 Furthermore, for homologous hydrophobic and hydrophilic series (f = 0.67−1.0) generated at 0.2 M potassium chloride (KCl), the authors reported coacervate compositions evaluated by TGA. With the proviso that the hydrophobicity of the chains may have a stronger impact at lower f, the authors concluded from these findings that charge density dominated phase behavior. A theoretical study conducted recently by Rumyantsev et al. described a scaling law-based salt concentration−solvent quality diagram
of PECs.159 Figure 28 displays the coacervate regime diagram in cs−v coordinates. However, due to strong charge correlations in highly charged PEs, neither RPA nor scaling can properly treat them; hence, more complex theoretical approaches (as well as
simulations)16,142,252 are needed to address this issue

(explained later in the text). Current theories of coacervate attempt to integrate the account of charge connection in polymer chains with methods from liquid state theory. The Ornstein−Zernike equations are modified by include the intramolecular correlation function. In order to keep things simple, edge effects are disregarded and correlations between charges in linear polyions are taken to be independent of the charge’s distance from the chain end. The key benefits of this technique are its applicability to the case of heavily charged PEs and its realistic predictions on strong charge correlations
with respect to excluded volume effects.344 Regretfully, approaches based on liquid state theory typically necessitate the numerical solution of integral equations and are not capable of yielding analytical findings. Recently, coacervate has made use of a technique known as “renormalized Gaussian fluctuation field theory”, which permits the self-consistent determination of conformations of PE chains as well as charge correlations (as long as the RPA chain structure is determined
by presumptions).345 In line with previous results from fieldtheoretic simulations conducted in ref 27, this work demonstrated that chains inside the coacervate do, in fact, adopt Gaussian conformations throughout a broad range of salt concentrations. The primary benefit of these methods over traditional RPA became a rigorous description of the supernatant where chains inflate and lose ideal-coil statistics, and strong binodals of associative phase separation were
created.27,345 In ref 64, an alternative method for handling dense inter-polyelectrolyte complexes (IPECs) of strongly charged PEs was suggested. The authors examined shortranged correlations along the polyion backbone using transfer matrix formalism, taking into consideration the potential adsorption of charged groups from, say, polyanions or salt anions, to charged units of polycations.
5.4.3. Temperature and Solvent. Temperature dependence
was not seen by Kaibara et al.320 for pHc and pHφ346 for BSA and PDADMAC. Others, however, noted that temperature variations had a notable impact on the stability of certain complex compounds. Peptide−nucleotide (nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates) coacervates were first introduced as protocell models by Koga et al. They found that up to 90 °C,
the coacervates of ATP/PLys and CTP/PLys remain stable.121 Williams and associates employed poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA, called PDAD
MAC elsewhere in this Review), an alternative kind of polycation, and verified that PDDA-nucleotide droplets exhibit
stability up to a minimum of 85 °C.347 Temperature can produce coacervation of the PE/micelle system because it can be entropy-driven due to the release of counterions. Although
temperature has an impact on micelle size,199 a real phase transition�characterized by a sudden rise in turbidity at Tφ� that results from the development and expansion of soluble complexes is still possible. When commercial dodecyl octa(ethylene glycol) monoether (C12E8) and Triton X-100 (TX100) polydisperse surfactants are substituted with
monodisperse C12E8, the transition becomes more abrupt.348 A second transition is seen upon heating the coacervate itself, yielding a fresh coacervate and supernatant at Tφ′. Shear can also cause this phase transition in the coacervate, as
demonstrated by turbidimetry,349 dynamic light scattering
(DLS), and rheology.350 The oppositely charged molecules are soluble below a critical temperature (the LCST) and only phase separate when heated to above the LCST, as demonstrated by Keating and colleagues, who also demonstrated that poly-U RNA can
undergo LLPS in the presence of spermine.351,352 HA and cationic elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) generate complex coacervates that exhibit LCST behavior as well; the charge ratio of the used macromolecules can adjust the transition
temperature.353,354 However, it was found that complex coacervates of protamine and multivalent anions, including citrate and tripolyphosphate, had UCSTs of 36 and 55 °C,
respectively, at which point the coacervates disintegrated.355 Lastly, depending on their sequence, de novo synthesized intrinsically disordered peptides with oppositely charged
residues can exhibit both UCST and LCST behaviors.264,356 To put it briefly, it is unclear how temperature will affect the peptide−nucleotide complex coacervate formation. If the creation of peptide−nucleotide coacervates is influenced by aromatic stacking interactions, then raising the temperature may decrease these contacts and perhaps dissolve the coacervates, much like melting DNA and RNA duplexes. DNA duplexes typically show a melting temperature (Tm), which is determined by a number of variables, the primary one
being the sequence.357 Parallel to this, experimental studies have started to look into the effects of variables like the particular chemical characteristics of each individual polymer and the effects of solvents on
complexation.54,141,159 The impact of polymer−solvent interactions on the phase behavior and complex morphology in PE
systems, including natural polymers,358 polypeptides,204 and
synthetic polymers,146,343 has recently been discussed. It is interesting to note that, depending on the organic solvent and PE pair chosen, increasing the volume ratio of organic solvent
to water can either strengthen152 or weaken359 the salt resistance of coacervates. However, a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms to explain this variability is lacking. In one instance, during the complex coacervation of anionic sodium poly(styrenesulfonate) (NaPSS) and cationic conjugated PE poly(3-[6′-{N-butylimidazolium}hexyl]thiophene) bromide in tetrahydrofuran (THF)−water mix
tures demonstrated by Danielsen et al.,360 it was discovered that the increased solubility of the PE pair in the organic solvent caused the physical state of PECs formed from conjugated PEs to change from solidlike precipitates to fluidlike coacervates upon the addition of the organic solvent
to an aqueous solution. In the presence of NaBr, Meng et al.359

combined poly[(vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium chloride] (PVBTMA) and NaPSS PEs in an aquo-organic (ethylene glycol−water or ethanol−water) mixed solvent medium to create a complex coacervate. Strong interactions cause PVBTMA and PSS to precipitate in aqueous media; however, coacervate is formed in the presence of salt and an aquoorganic medium. This could only occur as a result of the solvent’s lowering polarity and the strong electrostatic interaction becoming weaker. In a recent study, two pairs of PEs with distinct backbone chemistries were compared to examine the impact of solvent quality in aqueous environments. The hydrophobic polymers demonstrated greater salt
resistance in water than the hydrophilic polymer pair.52 The theoretical predictions of the coacervate phase diagrams, which ranged in the effective FH parameter (χ) from bad to theta to excellent solvent, were consistent with the experimental results. Alterations in side-chain structure were discovered to affect coacervate phase behavior in addition to differences in the polymer backbone. These alterations included an increase in salt resistance caused by a decrease
in local polarity.146 Coacervate production is thought to be dominated by the entropic gain resulting from counterion
release in high-dielectric conditions.18,66,69,152,361 It is still unknown under what circumstances the strength of electrostatic interactions�for example, as determined by the solvent dielectric constant�will have a significant impact on this
phase behavior.18,64 Enthalpic effects resulting from interactions among the solvent, polymers, and counterions
(captured in χ) can modulate this phase behavior.50,52,359,362 Detailed datasets quantifying phase behavior to illustrate the impact of hydrophobicity and other prevalent physical noncovalent interactions on polyelectrolyte complexation remain elusive despite advancements in the description of the influence of solvent interactions on complexation. To advance our current understanding of choosing PE pairs for PEC materials and to harness such materials into products and end-use technologies, it is imperative that we take into account these more practical aspects of complexation. A simplified coacervate model for active droplets based on
nucleotides was presented by Nakashima et al.363 They contend that the coacervate droplets form and do not go through Ostwald ripening, and that the concentration of substrate, enzyme, and protein in the experiment is reflected in
the droplet development rate. Khavani et al.364 performed a molecular dynamics simulation to comprehend the different forces and solvation influencing the impact of ethanol solvents on PDADMAC and PSS pairings in aqueous solution. A protein (lysozyme)−polyelectrolyte (PSS) or polyphosphate) combination was studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The polymerization levels of the proteins varied. While long chains, which have a larger charge, do have loose fragments, short, charged chains are primarily attached to the proteins through repetition units. They elongate tails and generate charged loops around the protein surface. It is claimed that the
complex is stabilized by these loops.365 In the most recent research, “field-theoretic” simulations have been used to investigate the circumstances in which polymers with opposing
charges can form complex coacervates.16,366 For PEC systems (potassium poly(styrenesulfonate) (KPSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium bromide) (PDADMAB) with
added KBr salt),367 which were described in a mean-field theory formalism to identify the ranges of the solvent dielectric constant and the χ parameter to support these observations,
Prabhu and co-workers reported a LCST.260 There appears to be a LCST in Figure 29. Tcp is not a precise thermodynamic phase boundary, but rather the point at which the kinetics of phase separation become observable.
5.5. Other Complex Theories Describing “Variables Driving Polyelectrolyte Complexation” and “Effect of Polyelectrolyte Chirality”. Recent research has led to the development of complex theories (as demonstrated by numerical simulations) that take into account many of the variables that can affect coacervation, including sequence
specificity,73,368,369 charge correlation,152,370 and the formation
of soluble complexes (Figures 30 and 31).27,371 Figure 31’s conditions (salt concentration, 25 mM, and τ = 2) are represented by simulation images. None of these, however, offers a quantitative explanation for all varieties of liquid phases that separate proteins and polymers, making the classical mean-field model attractive

Figure 30. Charge-driven phase separation is influenced by molecular structure and sequence. (a) Qualitative drawing of a typical phase diagram for complex coacervate-forming polyelectrolytes. In coacervation, oppositely charged polyelectrolytes go through a liquid− liquid phase separation into polymer dense (coacervate) and polymerdilute (supernatant) phases at low salt and polymer concentrations. The various curves show qualitatively how the immiscible region varies with various molecular characteristics (charge monomer sequence, spacing, ion size, level of polymerization, valency, etc.). Charge monomer sequence is a molecular characteristic that can be used to adjust the behavior of coacervation, as shown in (b). Based on coacervation between a homopolyanion and a series of model, sequence-defined polycations with half of their monomers charged, this simulation and experimental result. Coacervation is experimentally seen as droplets of a polymer-dense “coacervate” dispersed in a polymer-dilute “supernatant” phase. These polycations are characterized by the periodic repeat of the monomer sequence, τ (c).

despite its relative simplicity. This model can offer semiquantitative agreement with experimental phase diagrams based on a single effective interaction parameter (χ or
α).135,370 The use of acid−base interactions to get around the free energy barrier to mixing rods and coils in polyacid/ polybase PECs, which arises primarily from the reduced entropy of mixing in the presence of rods, must also be mentioned. Molecular polymer−polymer composites are created when rigid-rod macromolecule solutions are mixed with random coil macromolecule solutions of the opposite charge. The experiments were modeled by adding a negative
parameter to the original Flory theory.372,373 Using a Gaussian
fluctuation analysis, Qin and de Pablo22 more recently showed how the addition of chain connectivity, in particular the fractal dimension of the connectivity (e.g., rods versus coils versus branched polymers) has a major impact on coacervation. Shen
and Wang20 created a renormalized Gaussian fluctuation field theory that, in formulating a description of electrostatic correlations, self-consistently accounts for polymer chain conformation and connectivity. The DH theory is particularly related to the RPA model for electrolytes, which provides the foundation for methodically enhancing field theoretic models
of coacervation.15 For concentrated systems of weakly charged
PEs, Borue and Erukhimovich24,25 pioneered the use of the
RPA, which was later developed by Castelnovo and Joanny15 for the unique case of complex coacervation. With the aid of a diagrammatic representation of ion pairs as “reversible cross
links”, Olvera de la Cruz162 included short-range correlations. It also included a high-q modification to simulate the impact of finite excluded volume. Through a change to the Coulomb potential’s form, they explicitly included the effect of excluded volume. This outcome is a last-minute addition that was mathematically selected to be easily incorporated into the RPA formalism. The magnitude of the effect is sensitive to the highly approximate form of the excluded volume, but this advancement is crucial in capturing the experimentally observed phenomenology of salt partitioning to the super
natant. Numerous authors, including Castelnovo and Joanny,23
Kudlay, Ermoshkin, and Olvera de la Cruz,163 Zhang and
Shklovskii,200 and Shusharina, Zhulina, Dobrynin, and
Rubinstein,342 have thought about the possibility of finitesized aggregates in the dilute regime, either by ion-pairing of individual charges or by non-specific electrostatic correlations (Figure 32). However, the PE conformation, or form factor, was assumed to be stable and insensitive to the concentrations or binding states of species. This form factor, which represents monomer connectivity and needs to be supplied to the RPA formal
ism.20,22 This constraint has recently been addressed by Shen

and Wang’s variational technique, which permits the selfconsistent determination of both the electrostatic free energy
and the PE conformation.20 Future prospects could be bright if this variational technique is incorporated into coacervation models. The Chan group modeled the coacervation of sequence-defined polyampholytes using the RPA formu
lism.114,116,374 These are analogues of IDPs, where the structure−function characteristics of the protein are determined by the exact amino acid sequence running along it. As a result, coacervates derived from these PEs resemble biological organelles that are put together from IDPs. The Chan group discovered that PEs with longer like-charge blocks, or “blockier” sequences, provide a bigger coacervation composition window than PEs with a random distribution of charges along the chain. This finding is consistent with multiple in vitro and in vivo tests on organelles. When the temperature or salt concentration is raised, the latter’s coacervates dissolve more easily in the solution, or sometimes they do not form coacervates at all. Two forces between charged species are
included in the FTS method developed by Fredrickson et al.:16 short-range excluded volume interactions and long-range electrostatic interactions. The strengths of these forces are determined by an excluded-volume parameter v and the Bjerrum length lB, respectively. By detecting higher order
electrostatic correlations in PE solutions�that is, correlations that go beyond the pair-correlation-level FTS has the edge over RPA. This method has also been used to coacervate sequence
defined polyampholytes,26,27,255 in addition to homo-PEs.16,256 Such developments in “physics-based” models of coacervation present hitherto unseen avenues for advances in materials science in general as well as in the knowledge of biological cellular organization. However, in the aforementioned methods, the coacervation mechanism is primarily restricted to the electrostatic attractions between the oppositely charged PE monomers in a dielectric continuum. The chemical identities of the species involved, however, have a significant impact on the behaviors of both synthetic and naturally occurring PEs in addition to the electrostatic interactions. These species are thought to be under the purview of physical chemistry and control local interactions on the nanoscale. In the end, RPA and associated methods of analytical field theory clarify the physical relationships between electrostatics and chain connectivity and can include adjustments to take into consideration
correlation and excluded volume effects.163,375 These are very complex theories, but because of their complexity, neither the transparency of their assumptions nor the ability of experimenters to adapt them is allowed. Indeed, RPA and related perturbative approaches treat polymers and electro
statics, both of which present well-known challenges.376 In particular, when the ion valency is high or the electrostatic
interactions are strong, these theories do not converge.358 This is a significant constraint; multivalent ions are at the limit of high charge densities, so high charge densities along a polymer chain continue to be problematic. For PE systems, numerous strategies to get around these difficulties have been put forth. These strategies usually assume the existence of an alternative
“highly ordered” state, such as an ionic solid,377,378 effective
chi-parameters,379,380 and/or ion condensation.153,156,381,382 Despite being driven by a strong physical intuition, these rely on systemic assumptions that reduce their predictive accuracy or restrict their range of application. Still, these insights have been crucial in advancing the condition of complex
coacervation. Audus et al.164 provide the first theoretical analysis of ordered morphologies. In order to account for the electrostatic correlations, they created a modified selfconsistent field theory (SCFT) with an embedded fluctuation (EF) model that uses the one-loop RPA. They looked into how the end-block fraction and polymer concentration affected the phase diagrams of salt-free triblock co-polyeletrolyte solutions using this EF model (Figure 33).
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements on an experimental system were consistent with the EF model calculations. Despite significant progress in comprehending hydrogels with ordered structures, the application of such EF models with Gaussian fluctuation contributions is limited when the line charge density is relatively high. Sing’s team made great strides toward coacervate self-assembly with high charge density polymers. To address scenarios with high charge density, they suggested a hybrid approach called “Monte
Carlo-single chain in mean field” (MC-SCMF) (Figure 34).383 Then, they integrated multiscale, coarse-grained MC simulations at the molecular level into field theoretical calculations. Their calculations agree well with earlier theoretical and experimental findings. In order to make predictions for both the macroscopic phase behavior and the

microscopic charge correlations present in complex coacervates, Ong and Sing recently developed a transfer matrix (TM) theory and incorporated it into a SCFT calculation
(Figure 35).384 Based on a one-dimensional adsorption model, the TM theory takes into consideration charge correlations associated with ion pairing, counterion condensation, and release (Figure
36).64 Their two-dimensional phase diagram predictions are
comparable to published experimental findings.385 This theory is simple to compute and demonstrates its originality. The three-order term that captures the excluded volume interaction
between polymer species and salt ions in the coacervate phase of the reaction is described by a phenomenological parameter in their TM method, which also neglects the spatial dependence of the TM of each segment along the chain in practical calculation. Additionally, simulations are required for
a more precise handling of the TM.386 Coacervate formation’s connection to the sequential adsorbed layers of weak PE that form PEMU films is a significant factor that is pertinent to contemporary polymer science. Similar to the discussion of bulk coacervate formation, it has been demonstrated that the concentration of polymers,

pH, and salts all affect the structure and composition of the multilayer composite sheet. Common features, i.e., solvent, charge density, molar mass, and conformation of the PE solutions, controlling the growth mechanism and properties of
the multilayer have also been specifically addressed.387−392 An arrested, non-equilibrium form of PEC is made by LbL growth. There is a clear similarity between the associative electrostatic interactions that propel complex coacervation and those that
propel the growth of LbL films.191,393,394 Although the field has long been aware of these similarities, not much has progressed because of the challenges involved in forecasting the dynamics
of PEC systems.77,268,307 Recently, Salehi et al. has proposed a potential correlation between measurements of coacervate
phase behavior and the growth rate of LbL films.395 The growth kinetics and corresponding bulk phase behavior of LbL films made of PAA and PDMAEMA at different pH values and without salt are shown in Figure 37. It is still necessary to validate this method further using a wider variety of polymer systems. Colloidal clustering is a useful lens through which to view
complex coacervation,248 but this idea has not gained much traction, in part because the field was founded on the association of flexible polyampholytes (i.e. gelatin) not considered to be as colloidal particles. It is evident that welldefined and thermodynamically stable inter-macro-ionic aggregates exist close to the point of phase separation and that attractive and repulsive interactions between them contribute to the coalescence of these aggregates, at least for colloid−polyelectrolyte coacervation. In comparison to conventional colloids, these clusters have much more complex
structural hierarchies: at the largest scale, multipolymer aggregates are formed by the association of intra-polymer complexes, which in turn are formed by the attachment of
micelles to polymers, which are surfactant aggregates.396 The cluster sizes and structures of the resulting dense phases are determined by the primarily electrostatic repulsive and attractive forces acting over various length scales. The cluster sizes and structures of the resulting dense phases are determined by the conflict between short-range attraction and longer-range repulsion (SALR) acting at various length
scales.397−402 Colloidal systems interacting through SALR have a rich phase behavior and can show one or more stable liquid− liquid phase transitions. One first-order phase transition occurs from the vapor to a fluid of spherical liquid-like clusters, and the other occurs from the liquid to a fluid of spherical voids. This effect of repulsion has been found to be analogous to the liquid−vapor critical point and a portion of the associated
liquid−vapor transition line (Figure 38).403−405 An intriguing problem that has not yet been solved is the potential retention of aggregate structural characteristics within the macroscopically homogeneous dense phase. These ideas can be used in the context of polyelectrolyte− micelle complexation and coacervation, in which short-range attractions between complexes resulting from polarization or disproportionation compete with long-range electrostatic repulsions among complexes of like charge that are subject to screening. When complexes cluster or phase separate, intermacro-ionic ion-pairing replaces macro-ion-bound counterions, temperature is the parameter that reduces the Coulomb repulsion between PECs by increasing the entropy of counterion expulsion. The coexistence of coacervate droplets�liquid-like clusters on a micrometer or submicrometer scale�in the supernatant at low volume fraction and supernatant droplets (voids) in a coacervate dense medium at high volume fractions is predicted by this colloidal model, which views the polyelectrolyte−micelle complexes as intricately hierarchal soft colloidal particles. This scenario suggests that the macroscopically homogeneous dense phase retains micelle−polyelectrolyte aggregate structural features,
for which there is currently little experimental support.406−408

PEs’ chirality has a significant impact on how they complex. According to Perry et al., homochiral poly(lysine) and poly(glutamic acid) form solid complexes for any combination of D and L polyanion and polycation, while at least one of the polypeptides must be racemic (e.g., random copolymer of D
and L monomers) in order for liquid coacervates to form.409 The authors utilized several concentrations of NaCl solutions. Characterization by visual or optical microscopy was done (Figure 39). Both liquid and solid complexes are the result of a fine balance of forces. The method is inherently collaborative. The interaction strength is regulated by salt’s charge screening, as was previously described. Urea and salt each have an impact on a complex’s stability. Both the strength of the intermolecular interactions and the physical state of the complexes are determined by chirality. A mixture of poly(Llysine) and poly(L-glutamic acid) exhibits a shift from solid precipitate to liquid coacervate with an increase in urea
concentration.409 Solid complexes of stereoregular polyions have hydrogen-bonded β-strand secondary structures, which are lacking in liquid coacervates, according to Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy.409 Here, the main sequence regulates the non-electrostatic rather than bare Coulomb
interactions between oppositely charged monomers to adjust the polymer-rich phase’s final state. The structural differences between coacervates derived from racemic counterparts and complexes formed from homochiral polypeptides were
validated by atomistic MD simulations.210,409 The complexation between poly(lysine) and poly(glutamic acid) with carefully defined sequences of L and D monomers
was examined in later experimental studies.209 The sequences of the polyanions and polycations were the same, with blocks of n consecutive L monomers divided by a single D unit, and the degree of polymerization of both polypeptides was fixed at 30. Liquid coacervates were produced by polypeptides at short block lengths (n ≤ 7). When n ≥ 8, the homochiral block has enough length to cause the solid precipitate phase with β-sheet
structures to form.209 In a different study, the impact of polypeptide stereoregularity on phase behavior was examined
by Kuroyanagi et al.410 for both homochiral and racemic poly(ornithine-co-citrulline) (POC) compounds. Helical polypeptides have a greater separation temperature (TP) than their coiled-coil racemic counterpart. TP is therefore impacted by variations in the secondary structure. At TP, the racemic POC form coacervates, while the helical homochiral POC assembles into a hexagonally packed form. Additionally, the α-helical homochiral POC precipitates after assembling into a hexagonal structure.
6. CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYELECTROLYTE COMPLEXES
6.1. Scattering Techniques: Small-Angle Neutron Scattering and Small-Angle Light Scattering. Smallangle neutron scattering (SANS) was originally used by Hone et al. to investigate the structure of complexed but not phase
separated PEs in solution.411 Small amounts of PSS or poly(2acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate) (PAMPS) added to αgelatin solutions above the melting temperature resulted in a significant complexation-induced increase in solution viscosity, as per their findings. The peak of the structural factors was found to be more intense due to the tightly bonded gelatin molecules, but it was similar in form and location to the peak of a solution containing solely PSS or PAMPS polyelectrolytes. The structure of the complexes in this instance appears to be dictated by the long synthetic PEs, and the higher viscosity is the result of complexation with the shorter gelatin. Shear flow applied to these viscous solutions causes anisotropy in the

intensity of the scattering because the PE chains are aligned,
but it does not alter the behavior of complexation.412 Regretfully, just one PE-to-gelatin mixing ratio was used for the structural analysis. It is not obvious if the structure would change when these macro-ions form a complicated coacervate, in which the PEs are necessarily close together in a dense liquid-like phase. The structural changes that occur when protein BSA is coacervated with a PE, NaPSS, at low pH were investigated by
Chodankar et al. using SANS.413 They discovered extremely comparable scattering curves to those of Singh et al. and Kizilay et al., with large-scale density correlations and a mesh size at high q that followed a power law scaling, akin to a fractal aggregate. Additionally, they assessed the strength of scattering from a sample of the diluted phase and discovered the presence of aggregates indicative of many PSS chains in that sample. Regretfully, power law scaling of the scattering intensity in complex coacervates and fractal-like formations were not explained. Singh et al. used differential scanning calorimetry and SANS to investigate the structure of agar/gelatin complex
coacervates.414 The two biopolymers separate into gels on their own, and the complex coacervates remarkably preserve the constituents’ thermal characteristics. According to the authors, the intricate coacervates have a mesh size of 1.2 nm and are physically entangled, interpenetrating networks of the two biopolymers. Interestingly, even though no leveling out of the intensity was seen, they discovered excess scattering in the low-q regime of their SANS observations, comparable to
Kizilay et al.174 They attribute this to large-scale concentration changes, with a typical correlation size of 22 nm. The structure of PDADMAC/BSA, a protein-containing complex coacervate, was examined by Kayitmazer et al. using light scattering, cryo
TEM, FRAP, SANS, and rheology calculations.81 It was discovered by rheology and SANS that BSA connects with the overall network topology of these complex coacervates, which
is again determined by the long PE, PDADMAC.174,415 The microstructure presented here is remarkably similar to the one discovered by Wang et al. for coacervates of the β
lactoglobulin/pectin complex.416 DLS, FRAP, cryo-TEM, and NMR experiments were performed on the PDADMAC/BSA
complex coacervates in addition to the SANS measurements.81 All of these data pointed to the presence of density-varying regions inside the complex coacervates that were significantly larger than the correlation length of the semidilute PDADMAC PE network. It is believed that more diluted domains with a lower concentration of BSA, which are also more loosely connected with the PDADMAC, coexist with dense domains with high concentrations of BSA that are complexed with the PDADMAC network. Thus, BSA diffusion in each of these domains is correlated with the slow and rapid diffusive modes that were detected in DLS, FRAP, and NMR. An anticipated size distribution of the domains ranging from 300 to 700 nm is in agreement with a power law scaling at low q in both static light scattering (SLS) and SANS. Lastly, cryo
TEM allowed for the direct observation of dense domains.81 Comparable dense domains have been discovered in lysozyme/PSS, Ch/BSA, and PDADMAC/SDS complex
coacervates.174 Currently, the explanation for the observed mesoscale heterogeneity in micelle−polyelectrolyte and protein−polyelectrolyte complex coacervates is not well understood. At temperatures between Tφ and Tφ′, micelle− polyelectrolyte coacervates of the PDADMAC-TX100/SDS system undergo a second phase separation under shear or
elongational flow.417 At length scales ranging from 0.94 to 5.0 μm, temperature- and shear-rate-related size changes were observed using two-dimensional small-angle light scattering (SALS). SALS images are nearly black at low shear rates and low temperatures because there is no scattering. Anisotropic phase-separation begins when scattering from circular microdroplets appears at a crucial temperature and shear rate. Microdroplets change from circular to ellipsoidal shapes in the flow direction as the shear rate increases. The droplet size and aspect ratio ranged from 1 to 4 μm and 1 to 4, respectively, in
the shear-rate range of 0.1−25 s−1. As the temperature is elevated at a fixed shear rate, similar changes in the droplets’ size and form are seen (Figure 40).
6.2. Imaging Techniques: Optical Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, Fluorescence Microscopy, and Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy. Optical microscopy (OM) is used to characterize the overall forms, average sizes, and surface morphologies of shape-augmented saloplastic
PECs.275,277,418,419 Additionally, OM is used to qualitatively differentiate between solutions, coacervates, and com
plexes.275,315 Remarkably, in order to see the distribution of fluorescently tagged PEs with the coacervates, coacervates are
further examined using a fluorescence confocal microscope.226 By using OM observation to study phase separation in a PAH/ PAA system doped with NaCl, Chollakup et al. were able to
distinguish precipitates from coacervates.80,85 Similarly, phase transitions preceding KBr-doped PDADMAC/PSS from complex via coacervate to solution phases were established
using OM.275 Furthermore, surface morphologies were scanned using SEM, confirming the presence of hollow pores on the ostensibly smooth resin surfaces, while the spherical forms of resins generated from the PDADMAC/PSS
coacervates were confirmed by OM.275 Meng et al. conducted more research on the surface morphologies of saloplastic PEC fibers electrospun from PSS/PDADMAC coacervates in 1.60
M KBr that were pristine418 and dye-colored.419 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used by Zhu et al. to investigate the well-defined microstructure of 3D-printed
PNaSS/PMPTC gel.420

Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy images are typically included with SEMs, and they are used to identify and
quantify the elemental compositions of samples.275,421 PEC resins made up of PSS and PDADMAC were discovered to have residues of K and Br from the KBr salt used for plasticization, as well as C, N, O, and S components coming
from the PEs using EDX profiling.275 Three-dimensional structural and topological data, including surface roughness and thickness, can be obtained using atomic force microscopy
(AFM).422−424 As a result, AFM was used to analyze the surface topology of spin-coated PSS/PDADMAC films in
order to measure surface roughness.179 Additionally, AFM was used to identify pores that prevented PEI/PAA films from decreasing gas permeability by spanning the thickness of the
film.423 Additionally, the hydrodynamic radius, size, and distribution of tiny particles in PECs are characterized using the quasi-electric light scattering (QELS) or DLS technique. Micron-sized spherical coacervate droplets were revealed by fluorescence microscopy of a coacervate suspension of PDADMAC with BSA and BSA-F (BSA labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate) (Figure 41; see Table 1 for
details),425 identical to, for example, the SEM images of
albumin/acacia coacervate suspensions426 or the OM images
of gelatin−gum arabic coacervate suspensions.334 Interestingly, the size distribution of BSA/PDADMAC microdroplets was tight at neutral pH (pH ∼7), but at higher pH’s (pH 9.0) it
expanded with an increase in larger droplets.425 The investigation of PDADMAC-BSA coacervates has benefited from the use of cryo-TEM, which has produced pictures with greater resolution and no labeling required. A random distribution of irregular and partially interconnected solid-like regions of protein-rich domains, referred to as “clusters” or “dense domains”, with interdomain distances of 300−700 nm
was demonstrated by cryo-TEM images13 taken at high electrostatic interaction conditions (pH 9, I = 50 mM NaCl) (Figure 42a). Certain solid-like regions are between 100 and 1000 nm in size, and others are similar in size to desolvated intra-polymer complexes (also known as “aggregates”), which range from 50 to 100 nm. The linkages between the aggregates were less clear, despite the fact that these aggregates also emerged at reduced interaction strengths (pH 8.5 and I = 100
mM NaCl) (Figure 42b).81 However, it is easy to envisage that these aggregates have a tendency to form linear arrays.

Table 1. Techniques used to study the coacervate suspension in Figure 41
1. Turbidimetry: Using a Brinkmann PC800 colorimeter with a 2 cm route length probe and a wavelength of 420 nm, turbidity was measured at 24 ± 1 °C. NaOH was employed in “Type I” titrations to adjust the pH of a macromolecular
solution that was kept at a constant ionic strength. In a chosen ionic strength medium at pH 4.00, specified proportions of polymer and protein solutions were combined to create protein/polyelectrolyte solutions. NaOH (0.1 M) solution
was gradually added while being continuously stirred from a microburet. After each titrant increment, the pH and transmittance (%T) of the solution were measured, giving the solution 1−2 min to reach equilibrium. The majority of the
studies were carried out in 0.1 M NaCl, while some were done in 0.02, 0.04, or 0.05 M NaCl to examine the effects of ionic strength. In relation to the concentration of NaCl, the ionic strength contributions of the polymer, protein, or
additional NaOH titrant were always less than 1 mM and could be disregarded.
2. Separation and Analysis: Solutions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm (Model CL, International Equipment Co.) for approximately 15 min following the creation of coacervate in order to separate the coacervate from supernatant. For additional
analysis, the separated coacervate was then redissolved in 5 mL of 0.02 N HCl that had been adjusted to the same ionic strength as the supernatant.
3. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) Measurement: A Superose 12 column (Pharmacia, 30 × 1 cm) was used for SEC. A 100μL injection loop and a minipump (Milton Roy) were integrated into the system. To monitor protein and
polymer concentrations simultaneously, UV (Gilson 112 UV/vis, Gilson λ = 254 nm) and refractive index (Waters Associates R401) detectors were connected in series. Pullulan standards (P-82, Shodex Standard, Showa Denko) were used
to calibrate the column. The mobile phase (pH 4.0, I = 0.2 M, HAc-NaAc buffer) flowed at a rate of 0.52 mL/min. There is no protein/polymer complexation during this mobile phase. Using calibration curves made with known protein
concentrations, UV peak heights were converted to protein concentrations. In a similar manner, PDADMAC concentrations were ascertained from RI peak heights. An uncertainty of ±5% was contributed by the SEC analysis, which was the
primary source of error in the selectivity measurement.
4. UV Measurement: Utilizing a Hewlett Packard 8450A diode array spectrophotometer, UV measurements were conducted at 280 nm. Protein standard solution absorbance was used to calculate the proteins’ extinction coefficients. Based on
the computed attenuation coefficients and measured absorbance, unknown protein quantities were ascertained.
5. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Utilizing a 100 mW Ar-ion laser, DLS was performed utilizing a 72 channel BI-2030 AT digital correlator from Brookhaven (Holtsville, NY). To ensure that no macromolecules were lost during the
filtration process, UV measurements were taken both before and after dust filtration of DLS samples using a 0.2 μm filter.
6. Rheology and Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP): Rheology and FRAP were used to investigate the coacervate structure. According to FRAP, BSA’s diffusivity in coacervates is equivalent to that of a probe of equal size
that does not interact. It was discovered that the coacervate’s microviscosity was 2 orders of magnitude less than its macroviscosity (Newtonian). Thus, the “bonds” between proteins and polyelectrolytes in coacervates are brittle and non
specific. Moreover, PDADMAC was electrostatically bonded to silica capillaries, controlled porous glass (CPG), and chromatographic packing material. Subsequent protein binding is influenced by the pH, ionic strength, and mixing duration
of polyelectrolyte adsorption on CPG, most likely due to the molecular characteristics of the adsorbed polyelectrolyte layer. The structure of adsorbed polyelectrolytes and subsequent protein binding were found to be correlated through
SEC and quasi-elastic light scattering investigations. The electroosmotic flow measurements were interpreted in terms of the adsorbed PDADMAC structure, taking into account the polymer molecular weight and ionic strength. It was
shown that using treated capillaries improved protein separations.

6.3. Turbidity and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC): Enthalpic and Entropic Contributions. Turbidity monitoring is one of the most often utilized methods for the investigation of complex coacervation because of its dependability and simplicity for tracking the structural development of protein/polysaccharide complexes. Three crucial pHs indicate the transition in the structure evolution during the pH-induced turbidity evolution. They are as follows: The development of soluble complexes from co-soluble mixed solutions was indicated by the first critical pH (pHc); the production of insoluble complexes from soluble complexes was indicated by the second critical pH (pHφ1); and the dissociation of insoluble complexes was indicated by the third critical pH (pHφ2). Furthermore, the particle size will achieve its maximum at a pH, known as pHopt or pHmax, when the charge of insoluble complexes becomes neutral. For instance, Figure
43321 illustrates the evolution of turbidity in protein (pI = 4.5)/anionic polysaccharide (pKa = 2) complexes as a function of solution pH. Turbidity measurements have been used to track inter
actions between biological macromolecules such as BSA320 and carboxymethylcellulose with proteins (whey protein, gela
tin).427 Using the same methodology,80,85 the effects of pH, PE ratio, MW, and salt concentration were investigated for the PAA/PAH system. Moreover, employing turbidity and OM, comprehensive phase diagrams for the complexation of
oppositely charged polypeptides have been created.68 Although they are uncommon in the literature, these phase diagrams are excellent resources for preparing coacervates from a particular PE pair. Turbidity can provide us a thorough grasp of how important parameters affect coacervation, but it cannot tell us enough about the nature of the process. For a thorough understanding of coacervation, a thermodynamic analysis that will reveal the complexation’s driving force
is required. An experimental method called isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) has been utilized to shed light on the thermodynamics of the complex formation between charged species. ITC has been widely used to evaluate the type and amount of energy involved in the interactions between
biomaterials,250 biopolymers and synthetic polymers,428
biomacromolecules and vesicles,429 polymers and surfac
tants,430−433 as well as proteins and polysaccharides.434−436 Using the appropriate models, the thermodynamic parameters of the interactions between the species have been determined. These include the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy
changes, binding constants, and ratio.69 Because of its calorimetric methodology for the direct measurement of the enthalpy change (ΔH), which reflects the heat generated or absorbed upon the interactions between two macromolecules, ITC is an excellent tool for studying the complexation between two biopolymers. A titration curve based on the heat released or absorbed in each titration can be produced during the experiment. The stoichiometry of the interactions (N), the affinity constant (K), and the entropy change (ΔS) can be derived by fitting the titration curve with a suitable model. Moreover, the entropy (ΔS) and the enthalpy (ΔH) changes can be used to compute the Gibbs free energy (ΔG).
According to Kayitmazer,361 one way to assess how experimental conditions affect the complexation of proteins and polysaccharides is to alter the components under
investigation through ITC assays. A new detailed description69 of the impact of varying the experimental conditions (salt, pH, temperature) on the thermodynamic parameters of the complicated coacervation of polypeptides has been published. The ITC test is frequently used to confirm how pH affects proteins and polysaccharides complex. Three pH’s (pH 6, 5.5, and 3.5) were used for the ITC testing including pea protein
isolate and pectin.437 Because of the two biopolymers’ weak electrostatic contacts, very little enthalpy change was seen at pH 5.5 and 6.0. In contrast, the nonspecific electrostatic interactions between pea protein isolate (PPI) molecules and pectin chains resulted in the regular peak reduction and exothermic titration profiles at pH 3.5. Using ITC, the fundamental thermodynamic driving forces for complex coacervation were examined for a subset of the superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) variants. Using this method, the amount of electricity required to keep the temperature constant while macromolecules interact is calculated. With the right model, thermodynamic characteristics and affinity

constants for the interaction may be computed based on the power required to change the temperature as the titration
progresses.69,76,152 This power is indicative of the sign and magnitude of any interactions occurring. A two-step binding model, which has been previously published by Priftis et al. and
Chang et al., was used to analyze the ITC data.69,152 It is divided into two regimes: ion pairing and coacervation, which are depicted in Figure 44A in blue and red, respectively.
The data was fitted using the total energy, which is the sum of the two contributions (black). The complex coacervation thermodynamic conditions are universal to all spontaneous processes. On the other hand, coacervate formation’s driving force is distinct in that it depends on the system. As in all selfassembly processes, coacervation is preferred when ΔG is negative. When TΔS is highly positive and/or ΔH is highly negative, this condition is met. Because of this, it is thought that endothermic processes are entropically driven, whereas
exothermic processes are enthalpically driven.252 The coacervates produced by combining the polysaccharide sodium alginate with the protein lactoferrin were examined by Bastos
et al.439 According to the thermodynamic parameters, lactoferrin and sodium alginate have a strong binding affinity that is exothermic, with an enthalpic contribution and an unfavorable entropic effect during this process. Yoshihara et
al.’s study440 examined the phase separation of carboxymethylcellulose and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) under both endothermic and entropic driving. A broad pH range of 5−9 was discovered to provide the ideal coacervation condition at HEWL mass fraction ∼0.25. For the complexation and/or coacervation of oppositely charged macro-ions, the following instances can be provided: HA/BSA has ΔH = 4.77 kcal/mol and TΔS = 8.30 kcal/mol; PDADMAC/BSA has ΔH = −4.15
kcal/mol and TΔS = −0.26 kcal/mol,441 polyethyleneimine/ polyglutamic acid has ΔH = 2.4 kJ/mol and TΔS = −30 kJ/
mol,69 and PAA/human serum albumin has ΔH = 15 kJ/mol
and TΔS = −50.66 kJ/mol.442 Entropy is asserted to be the primary driver of interaction in oppositely charged polyelectrolyte−polyelectrolyte complexation and/or coacervation in a
recent study by Fu and Schlenoff.18 By contrasting the ionpairing (or ion-exchange) model with the continuum electrostatics model, this conclusion is achieved. Comprehensive tests with various salt ions in the Hoffmeister series reveal that water disruption, not long-range Coulombic attractions and repulsions, is the cause of enthalpic contributions. In the meantime, counterion release during coacervation is mostly responsible for entropic gain. The impact of polymer chain lengths on coacervation caused by oppositely charged polypeptides, such as poly(L-lysine) and poly(D,L-glutamic
acid), was investigated by Li et al.144 The coacervate phase region expands and the coacervate phase gets denser and more salt-resistant as polypeptide chain lengths increase. Stronger electrostatic interactions in polymers with longer chains lead to greater improvements in entropy via counterion release. However, in contrast, the first non-electrostatic coacervate
reported by Jing et al.443 and created by combining inorganic polyoxometalate (POM) with the extremely hydrophilic neutral polymer PEG using entropy driving (Figure 45),
instead of the counterions as is generally believed, the water molecules coupled in the interface could form hydrogen bonds with both PEG and POM, which leads to the release of surplus hydrated water from the hydrogen shells for entropy-driven complex coacervation. Entropic rise was discovered for oligolysine/nucleic acid complexation as a result of a significant
drop in K with ionic strength.444 But as Zhu and Evans445 have shown, entropy rise could just as well result from polar macromolecules becoming dehydrated, as happens when DNA complexes with cationic surfactants. Nonetheless, in systems involving a colloid, such as protein− polyelectrolyte and micelle−polyelectrolyte, complexation or coacervation can be fueled by either entropy or enthalpy. Colloid−polyelectrolyte complexation is influenced by a complex range of factors, in contrast to polyelectrolyte− polyelectrolyte systems. These factors include the molecular geometry of the colloid, the charge anisotropy of proteins, the polarizability of micelle charges, and a more subtle hydrophobic effect brought about by the buried nature of
hydrophobic groups in proteins.361 Given the specific globular protein and polymer, predicting the thermodynamics of a protein’s phase behavior would help with the logical design of a charged polypeptide tag. It would also help with simulations

aimed at approximating the phase space of genetically modified globular proteins. Generally speaking, it is crucial to remember that turbidity-style measurements and microscopy typically only offer a qualitative, phenomenological mapping of coacervate phase behavior, not a quantitative study. Also, ITC and turbidity are excellent tools for figuring out how a complicated coacervation process is going, but they don’t tell us much about the characteristics of the coacervate phases themselves. ITC signals may be associated with a wide range of processes, including dissociation, complexation, conformational shifts, and aggregation state modifications. Therefore, in order to link ITC data with molecular processes, supplementary studies like DLS, electrophoretic mobility, DSC, SAXS, and/or SANS are needed. However, rheology is a method that has been applied to that purpose for coacervates
made of synthetic polymer systems448 or biopolymer.446,447 For example, the rheological and microstructural properties of the coacervates were assessed in a study of gum arabic and Ch electrostatic complexes, produced at varied pH levels (3.0, 4.5,
and 6.0).449 The majority of the aforementioned publications used one experimental approach primarily, or several methods focused on different aspects of the complicated coacervation phenomena. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that the choice of PEs might have varying impacts on coacervation, making the research of each system relative. These parameters include pH, salt, and stoichiometry.
6.4. Rheology and Diffusion Techniques: FRAP, PFGNMR, and DLS. In order to enhance and optimize applications, there has also been an increase in interest in understanding the rheological characteristics of coacer
vates.411,450 A number of biopolymers,446,447 and/or synthetic
polymer systems451 have already been taken into consideration for this purpose. There is frequently a viscoelastic response in
complex coacervates,313 and rheological investigations have revealed that a number of factors, including salt concentration, mixing stoichiometry, and chain length, have an impact on the
viscoelasticity and viscosity of complex coacervates.66,448
6.4.1. Encapsulation and Release. Rheology has been used to comprehend the effect that a guest molecule has on the structure of a complex coacervate in addition to characterizing the features of the base material. Salbutamol sulfate, a bronchodilator used to treat asthma and other chronic airway illnesses, was investigated by Tiwari et al. in both its encapsulation and release from coacervates made from the
protein molecules gelatin-A and gelatin-B.452 Drug encapsulation resulted in both a slight increase in the loss modulus (G′′), indicating a corresponding fluidization of the material, and a significant decrease in the storage modulus (G′), indicating that the coacervate matrix was disturbed and weakened by the presence of the drug. For the modeling of release mechanisms for increasingly sophisticated treatments, such changes in material properties can be crucial.
6.4.2. Connection to Layer-by-Layer Films and Solid Polyelectrolyte Complexes. Complex coacervation is driven by associative electrostatic interactions, which are identical to
those that cause LbL films to develop.191,393,394 In order to create LbL films, oppositely charged PEs are sequentially
deposited on a surface.453 LbL films are a kinetically trapped assembly, whereas complex coacervation is an equilibrium phase separation. To produce delivery capsules, such films can be created onto a variety of surfaces, such as bubbles and droplets. LbL assembly can be utilized to build capsules or as a layered structure that, when disassembled, allows for the
immediate release of medicines. The release of medicines can be controlled both spatially and temporally with careful layer structure design. As an alternative, the components of the films themselves could be used to create active coatings such
surfaces that are antibacterial and/or antifouling.454 LbL films can be created as free-standing films, although coatings are the way that they are most frequently used. However, recent studies have shown that bulk PECOX solids can also be useful. If a PECOX has been sufficiently plasticized with salt and water (“saloplasticity”), adding yet another processing
dimension, it may be extruded into big objects.274,455 The concept of “saloplasticity”, or salt-driven plasticization, has created a wide range of possibilities for processing PEC materials as liquid coacervates and subsequently solidifying the materials by removing the salt, and a variety of accounts highlighting spin-coated films, 3D-printed structures, electrospun fibers, and ultracentrifuged or extruded materials have
been reported.177,201,455−457 However, only synthetic polymer systems have been described for saloplastic materials thus far. It has a great deal of potential to increase the usefulness of this type of materials if biopolyelectrolytes such as HA, proteins, chondroitin sulfate, or chitosan are added.
6.4.3. Self-Healing and Structural Recovery. The capability of self-healing and structural repair following total network breakdown is another intriguing material trait brought about by the non-covalent nature of the molecular interactions
defining complex coacervates.450,458 This can be tested by breaking the sample under a large strain (100% oscillatory shear strain, which is well outside the material’s linear range), followed by continuous measurements in the linear strain regime to monitor the material’s capacity to regain its original elasticity and the required recovery time. A fish gelatin/sodium montmorillonite coacervate system is used as an example of
this kind of experiment (Figure 46).458
The application of a large strain reduces the material’s modulus from an initial high value for the equilibrium storage modulus (G′), breaking the internal elastic network of electrostatic contacts and turning it into a liquid-like substance. The sample was able to regain 20−30% of its initial modulus 5 min after this high strain was applied; this process may be
Figure 46. Monitoring G’ following the application of a 100% oscillatory shear strain allowed researchers to evaluate the behavior of structural recovery over time. The data points in regime III were fitted with G′ = G′∞ (1 − exp(t/τ)β) to produce the solid lines. The fitting parameters are listed in the inset table. Adapted with permission from ref 458.

described by an exponential function. According to Qazvini et
al.’s524 analysis of the impacts of network disruption in the example, the liquid-like behavior was not caused by individual nanoplatelets moving freely but rather by domain fracturing. These domains are then able to immediately revert to a network’s percolated elastic behavior to provide a solid-like response when strain is removed, followed by a gradual rearranging of the gelatin network. This ability to heal itself suggests that these kinds of materials might be treated simply as low-viscosity materials, such as thin films or injectables, and then given time to recover so that an elastic gel can form.
6.4.4. Microrheology Techniques. In a recent study by the
Brangwynne group,459 it was demonstrated that the RNA helicase LAF-1 of the DDX3 family, which promotes LLPS, is essential for the production of Caenorhabditis elegans P granules. The authors discovered that LAF-1 can influence P granule assembly in the early embryo and phase separate in vitro into liquid droplets that resemble P granules. They modified a microrheology method (Figure 47) that extracted
the viscoelastic characteristics of these micrometer-sized droplets through the Brownian motion of probe particles. The research, in conjunction with single molecule studies and FRAP, indicated that the disordered arginine/glycine-rich (RGG) domain of LAF-1 plays a part in increasing dynamic protein−RNA interactions and driving phase separation. The findings shed light on the process by which tunable material characteristics in liquid phase organelles can be produced at the molecular level, possibly underpinning physiologically adaptive capabilities. Here, the viscosity of LAF-1 coacervate-like droplets both with and without RNA was measured using confocal fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking techniques.
The scope of the current investigation does not allow for a more in-depth discussion of this kind of microrheological characterisation. However, the use of these methods might make a wide range of coacervate-based materials accessible for examination that would otherwise be beyond the scope of larger-scale rheological studies. The apparent mutual diffusivities, which are dominated by colloids (proteins and micelles) because of their substantially stronger scattering than PEs, can be obtained by the use of DLS. Conversely, FRAP provides data regarding the average diffusivities of the macromolecules that have been fluorescently tagged. The tagged probes, BSA and a neutral polysaccharide of the same size, are the only ones whose diffusivities are firmly associated with. Bohidar et al. examined coacervates produced at various pH and ionic strength (I) conditions from BSA and PDADMAC using
rheology and DLS.415 Reconstructing the elastic behavior following fracture with considerable shear revealed the existence of an equilibrium network, despite the system appearing solid-like at low strain. Multiple modes of protein diffusion were identified by DLS studies; surprisingly, considering the high viscosity, a fast diffusive mode was only an order of magnitude smaller than that of diluted protein. Centrifugation must be used to completely separate the supernatant phase from the dense coacervate phase in order to produce the extremely robust DLS results from these coacervates. This offers a degree of repeatability that is probably harder to achieve with suspensions of metastable coacervates than with equilibrium coacervates. Amazingly, months after a first run, the same three DLS modes are still obtained with only a minor reduction in apparent diffusion coefficients. The slow modes are not affected by the polymer’s MW, but they are sensitive to pH and I. This activity demonstrated the significance of electrostatic interactions and suggested the existence of a microheterogeneous structure that permits practically free protein diffusion in some areas. In addition to the DLS findings, FRAP provided information on the coacervate mesophase structure over extended time and
length scales (Figure 48).13 In PDADMAC-BSA coacervates, the diffusion coefficients of a neutral probe, Ficoll-isothiocyanate (Ficoll-F), were compared to those in a concentrated dextran solution of the same macroviscosity. Reaffirming the existence of partially interconnected (non-isolated) zones of

low effective viscosity in the coacervate, Ficoll-F diffused in coacervates more quickly than in an entangled dextran network. Fast and slow modes could be distinguished in the FRAP data for Ficoll-F diffusion: The modes in DLS were contrasted with these two modes. In the final set of tests, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled BSA (BSA-F) tagged with FITC was used in place of Ficoll-F to investigate the impact of an interacting probe on both slow and rapid modes. FRAP could only provide average diffusivities for BSAF; it was unable to resolve these modes. Thus, an intermediate mode is produced at the boundaries between dense and diluted domains by electrostatic adsorption. Weinbreck et al. employed diffusive wave spectroscopy (DWS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and FRAP to gather data on the composition of whey protein/gum arabic
complex coacervates.10 They discovered that the complex coacervate’s two components had lower diffusion coefficients than those of diluted solutions, although they were unable to investigate length scales less than about 1 μm. A sampleaveraged diffusion coefficient was measured for NMR and
DWS. Exactly like what Hone et al.411,412 found, one of the components had a significantly lower diffusivity. In this instance, the whey protein is linked to the complex coacervate structure but is far more mobile than the gum arabic, which determines the structure. More significantly, these results demonstrate that each component diffuses across the complex coacervate on its own. In summary, the majority of
complicated coacervates have a structure that is not well understood. The longer PE molecules appear to control the general structure of the complex coacervate networks in protein−polyelectrolyte and micelle−polyelectrolyte complex coacervates, and proteins are linked to these networks. On mesoscopic length scales ranging from tens of nanometers to a micrometer, these connections seem to be heterogeneous. This leads to variations in concentration and excess scattering at low q, which are all governed by an apparent power law with a slope of −2 ± 0.5. The microscopic structure of complicated coacervates, which are made up of two almost equal-length flexible PEs, is currently unknown. There are some fascinating questions that come up: Will the total network structure be determined by just one of the components? Will the complex coacervate behave as an interpenetrating semidilute solution or will the strong connections between the flexible PEs lead to strong pairing into stiff bundles (the “ladder” model)? Will the concentration changes last and will the independently diffusing oppositely charged PEs persist? Due to the difficulties in varying parameters that are necessary for the in vivo validation of phase transitions, researchers now mostly depend on descriptive features. The ability to undergo fusion or fission, changes in refractive index, roundness as a proxy for surface tension, and dynamic rearrangement within the phase as measured by FRAP are all commonly used to diagnose LLPS in vivo. This is largely because in vitro droplets exhibit similar
Figure 49. Diffusion and binding have distinct effects on the amount and rate of signal recovery. The most basic way to assess FRAP data is to calculate the recovery half-life (t1/2), as shown in (B). A molecule under study whose rate of diffusion is higher than its rate of binding means that adjusting the bleach spot’s size (shown by dashed circles in Figure 49A) will not have an impact on the recovery (dashed lines). According to LLPS, if diffusion is the limiting factor (C), the bleach spot’s size should have an impact on the curve’s t1/2. Adapted from ref 460.

tering (SANS)
1. SANS is used to analyze the internal composition and characteristic sizes of complex coacervates,
depending on the charge density. Compared to light scattering, SANS can access a larger range of
q-values, making it possible to directly measure structurally complicated systems. Over the length
ranges where the complex structure survives, the structure of protein−polyelectrolyte complexes is
completely consistent with features seen by microscopy. This implies that a single approach can
cover length ranges ranging from nanometers to microns. The shape, internal structure, and water
content of complex coacervates in a phase diagram have all been studied using the SANS approach.
In a study by Wagh’s group, the origin of the power law scaling of the scattering intensity and
fractal-like structures in complex coacervates remained unexplained on using SANS. Precisely, by
fitting the scattering data to an empirical model, the group was able to observe two discrete length
scales in BSA/NaPSS mixtures at circumstances of phase separation. When protein pI is
approached, the analysis of BSA/NaPSS complexes under various circumstances reveals a growing
fractal dimension, indicating the production of more dense complexes.

2. The application of SANS has shown benefits in analyzing the release characteristics of
polyelectrolyte vesicles for protein lipase, since it facilitates the calculation of the protein volume
fraction contained in a standard vesicle.
3. Hybrid techniques, such as simultaneous small-angle neutron scattering coupled with rheology
(rheo-SANS), are necessary to advance our understanding of the molecular structure of coacervate
based materials beyond composition and dynamics. These techniques have a great deal of potential
to further expand our understanding of these materials.

To gain a deeper understanding of the phase ordering kinetics in all complex coacervate mixes, SALS
was utilized in contrast to the complimentary techniques of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and
electrophoretic mobility (μE).
1. Nucleation and growth events, as well as spinodal breakdown in complex coacervation, are not
explicable by SALS.
[467, 468]
2. It is not possible to employ SALS and DLS in dense media, and they typically need a variety of
estimates on the light speckles, such as assuming that the optical index in dispersions remains
constant during intervention.

1. Models that explain the structure of coacervates and coacervate suspensions at the meso- and
micro-length scales, respectively, have been developed with the use of imaging of complicated
coacervates.
1. When describing phase behavior, high-precision turbidimetry combined with OM data is
commonly used as a qualitative indicator. For instance, Obermeyer’s group plotted turbidity data
as a function of mixing ratio so that the optimum mixing ratios for glucose oxidase−polycation
systems could be identified. Turbidity levels can range from 0% to 100%, with values above 20%
typically indicating the existence of phase separation (though not always) and values close to 0%
indicating the lack of phase separation.
[13, 81, 174,
408, 469
−502]
2. The primary objectives of OM for viewing coacervate samples are to verify whether the produced
materials are liquid or solid and to offer secondary confirmation of patterns (such as the presence
or absence of coacervates) inferred from turbidity. Solid precipitation usually manifests as fractal
aggregates, whereas coacervate droplets should appear as round or spherical formations either
floating in solution or attached onto a surface. OM is the sole method that can confirm the
existence and precise type of phase separation, whether it be between liquid and solid or liquid and
liquid.
2. Solvent-swollen microgels are challenging to image directly and accurately because of their
refractive index, which is naturally near to that of the aqueous solvent that causes the swelling.
Furthermore, even minute concentrations of a fluorescent dye can drastically change their
interfacial characteristics. Numerous recent studies have shown how adaptable soft microgel
particles are as liquid interface stabilizers. The precise process of their adsorption at air−water or
oil−water interfaces, as well as their structure at these liquid interfaces, is yet, at best, unknown.
The difficulty of imaging microgel particles at liquid interfaces in real-time and in real-space
makes answering these concerns challenging in part.
3. One of the most used methods for analyzing PE−protein surface topology at the nanoscale level is
AFM. PE−protein adsorption on surfaces can be qualitatively monitored using the average
roughness (rms). Furthermore, it is possible to quantify the 3D characteristics of big particles
adsorbed on a surface.
4. In cryo- and electron microscopy (including SEM), materials that have been stained to increase
contrast are illuminated by an electron beam. The resolution of this method is far higher than that
of OM because electrons have wavelengths that are around 100 000 times shorter than bright light.
Sample shape, content, and crystallinity are all studied using EM, which is also frequently used to
characterize protein−PE and PE−PE complexes. The structure of PE−protein complexes has been
understood through the application of TEM in conjunction with cryo methods. Precisely, Gummel
used cryo-TEM to report dense, spherical structures made of polyelectrolyte−protein complexes.
Using cryo-TEM, Kayitmazer et al. discovered this dense domain in protein−PE complexes for the
BSA/PDADMAC system. At greater resolutions, they also noticed 50 nm aggregates of BSA/
PDADMAC complexes.

ascertain the thermodynamics and binding affinity of these interactions. Because of the favorable
electrostatic interactions, protein−polysaccharide complexation is typically reported to be an
exothermic process. Coacervation is driven by a mix of entropic and enthalpic forces and has
distinct thermodynamics depending on the development of soluble aggregates and intra-polymeric
complexes. While exothermic signals were recorded on many protein−polysaccharide systems
studied in the literature, suggesting that their complexation was primarily enthalpy driven,
endothermic signals were effectively recorded by calorimetry on a number of reported systems
involving proteins and strong polyelectrolytes, indicating that complexation was driven by a gain in
entropy.
demonstrated by ITC that lysozyme binding to a negatively charged microgel is an entropic
process, even if the ionic strength dependence of binding affinity provides evidence for
electrostatic interactions as well. According to Henzler et al., counterion release causes
entropically driven interactions between BLG and 100 nm negative spherical polystyrene brushes.
Comparable ITC data from Becker et al. suggested that counterion release is also responsible for
RNase A’s adsorption on cationic polystyrene PE brushes. In conclusion, it might be difficult for
ITC to identify a precise mechanism for the details of PE−protein interactions.
Turbidity Specifically, turbiditimetry can be used to investigate how different factors, like temperature, pH,
ionic strength, and charge density, affect the behavior of the coacervate phase.
Although turbidity is the most practical way to gauge aggregate size change, it cannot differentiate
between precipitates and coacervates. For this reason, turbidimetry is typically used in
conjunction with OM to identify the phase border and see if the phase separation results in
precipitation or coacervation (also see Figure 50). Additionally, the inability to connect
compositional information with phenomenological observations of coacervate production is a
significant drawback of turbidity-style measurements.

4. Rheology and Diffusion Techniques
Rheology Rheology is an effective technique for characterizing materials that can give comprehensive details
about a material’s structure, self-assembly, and intermolecular interactions. Gels and coacervates are
typically described using rheology, which gauges a material’s flow properties under applied stress.
1. The coacervates that are created when water-soluble PEs of the opposite sign are mixed with salt
and water are among the last remaining areas of polymer research for which the linear rheology (i.
e., G′ and G′′ versus frequency) is still unclear.
[3, 318, 516,
517]
2. In addition to creative theorizing, more meticulous rheological experiments will probably be
needed to determine the range of validity of the various superposition principles, to more clearly
identify which PE systems have a low-frequency plateau modulus that is outside the experimental
uncertainty range, and to more thoroughly investigate the effects of various monomer and salt
types.
3. It is still unknown how rheology changes as phase separation continues.
Fluorescence Re
covery after
Photobleaching
(FRAP)
1. When evaluating material condition extremes or changes over time, FRAP is a helpful tool. In
addition to a full-FRAP, a half-FRAP can also be carried out if the structure is big enough. The
reorganization of fluorescence in a half-FRAP from the bleached to the unbleached region provides
more precise insight into the internal mobility of molecules inside a particular structure. Crucially,
depending on the recovery pattern, FRAP can also be helpful in determining if the droplets are
spatially homogenous.
1. Although FRAP data analysis is a very approachable method, it has certain drawbacks and
difficulties. One typical error is to believe that a full-FRAP’s recovery rate simply provides
information on the exchange rate between the dense and diluted phases. Nevertheless, other
factors that are frequently overlooked but affect the FRAP recovery rate include the size of the
photobleached droplet, movement within a droplet, and the extent of bleach regions.
[13, 72, 131,
460, 461,
518−526]
2. FRAP can investigate coacervate structure and dynamics over a wider variety of length and time
scales, whereas single particle tracking offers better information for the diffusion of single or very
tiny groups of particles on distance/time ranges of tens of nanometers and tens of milliseconds,
respectively. The ability to change the probe is another benefit of FRAP.
2. Fluorescence recovery is not exclusive to molecules that readily diffuse in solution. According to
several reports proteins can exhibit recovery even when they are involved in stable, high-affinity
binding relationships. The diffusion coefficient and concentration of the molecule being
measured, the rate at which it associates with binding partners and their diffusion coefficients, the
quantity and affinity of binding partners, technical considerations for the microscope and
detectors being used, and many other factors all play a complex role in the recovery of
fluorescence. The pace of recovery of a bleached patch can be affected by modifications to any
one of these parameters. Quantitative understanding of the underlying molecular dynamics
(diffusion, binding, etc.) can be obtained by modeling the recovery; however, it is widely
recognized that contrasting model selections can produce inconsistent results. Therefore, the fact
that experiments measuring FRAP in purportedly phase-separated compartments have found
recoveries ranging from subseconds to minutes for droplets formed from the identical IDR
(Figure 51) should be extremely concerning, even though ultimately unsurprising. The studies
reported by the Tjian’s group had recovery times that varied by over 3 orders of magnitude, and
in every one of them, the argument that the compartment in question was phase separated
depended heavily on fluorescence recovery (Figure 51C).
3. The research of the literature revealed that FRAP is one of the most widely used “gold standard”
assays to identify a compartment as “liquid-like,” aside from the capacity to conduct LLPS in vitro
(Figure 51A). It is believed in these investigations that the fluorescence recovery of a tagged
protein inside that compartment indicates a quick exchange or restructuring of the liquid inside.

particular organelles have been extensively studied using the FRAP approach. Fluorescent signal is
expected to recover in FRAP because it is thought that the photobleached molecules would
diffuse away from the bleach region and be replaced by new fluorescent molecules. (Figure 51B)
Dynamic Light
Scattering
(DLS)
1. The best method for figuring out a nanoparticle’s particle size is DLS. Particle size, size
distribution, and zeta potential in a solution can also be assessed using it. For the purpose of
characterizing particles, DLS is quick and simple to use, particularly with colloidal suspensions. DLS
has a number of benefits, including ease of use, sensitivity and selectivity to particulate matter, quick
measurement times, and the absence of calibration requirements. As a result, characterisation of
nanoparticles using this technique is becoming more common in a variety of scientific and
industrial domains.
Measuring samples with multimodal or bigger size distributions presents certain challenges. The
DLS approach can be used to determine the mean diameter of the nanoparticles if the measured
colloid is monodispersed. Since larger particles have greater scattering properties than smaller
ones, there is a possibility that larger particles will screen out smaller particles during the DLS
measurement for polydispersed colloids.
[527−530]
2. Understanding the impact of pH on the polyelectrolyte association process was made possible by
the combination of DLS and ITC data.
Pulsed-Field Gra

(NMR)
1. The basis of PFG-NMR has a number of intriguing characteristics that are pertinent to q-space
NMR, including the capacity to represent the signal as well as its Fourier transform. In contrast to
the earlier utilized techniques, this method is linear and able to replicate intricate signal patterns,
such as those displaying diffraction peaks. The coefficients may be estimated quickly and precisely,
and the representation makes it possible to compute important characteristics of the ensemble
average propagator, like its moments and RTOP (the return to the origin probability).
PFG-NMR may, in theory, differentiate between various oligomeric species, although resonance
widening makes it harder to detect larger species.
[124, 531
−542]
2. PFG-NMR, which measures the protein’s mobility, can help with LLPS droplet protein analyses.
PFG-NMR allows resonances to be separated based on differences in translational diffusion
coefficients.
3. In the presence of common water-soluble emulsion polymer species, PFG-NMR permits signal
editing of emulsion polymers, allowing the detection of low level components of high-MW species,
such as rheology modifiers, in the aqueous phase.
4. Diffusion−diffusion exchange spectroscopy (DEXSY), a two-dimensional variant of the PFG-NMR
experiment, has recently been presented and used to study systems that are exchanging. It is
possible to create numerically a comprehensive mathematical description of how limited diffusion
and molecular exchange affect the outcome of a PFG-NMR experiment The PFG-NMR
experiment’s numerical simulations for different diffusion constants and exchange rates allow for
the analysis of the experimental data to determine the pertinent parameters for molecular exchange
in a capsule system. Under a time-resolved experiment, the permeation process may also be seen
under non-equilibrium circumstances if it is slow enough. When a chemical component�such as
the active ingredient in a pharmaceutically significant carrier system�is intended to be contained
by nanocapsules or vesicles for a prolonged amount of time, the ensuing exchange constant
becomes a crucial metric. However, a systematic variation of the detected tracer molecule’s
molecular weight, polarity, or flexibility during the investigation provides useful information about
the permeability characteristics of the separating membrane. PFG-NMR proves to be an effective
method overall for a thorough investigation of nanocapsules and vesicles. The sole significant
disadvantage, which is a general lack of sensitivity, can be mitigated by using different tracer
molecules or extending the measurement period.

liquid-like behaviors.460 In order to directly address the “liquidlike” character of the hypothesized compartment, several groups have gone above and beyond in their FRAP studies. They have partially bleached a compartment and are searching for indications of internal rearrangement, which would suggest a LS.72 While these studies are better than reporting a single recovery period, unless control experiments are given, they should still be read with caution. One crucial check, for instance, is proving that diffusion, not binding, dominates the recovery rate.461 Testing whether healing is influenced by the bleach spot’s size (Figure 49)460 can demonstrate this. To make these tests definitive, it is also necessary to demonstrate that the entire fluorescence signal falls within the detector’s linear range and that internal rearrangement�rather than an external inflow of fluorescent molecules�is the only factor contributing to the recovery. Certain problems with FRAP in LLPS systems have been addressed by recent work, especially in relation to in vitro FRAP tests.462 Taylor et al.462 highlight a number of pertinent arguments, albeit deliberately ignoring the importance of lengthy binding events in modeling FRAP recovery�an aspect that is probably not applicable to many cases of LLPS in cells. Above all, they demonstrate how choosing a bleach spot size that matches the size of the underlying droplet can have a significant impact on the healing that results.462 Due to hard physical limitations, most cellular compartments are too tiny to perform FRAP on in vivo, which places major restrictions on FRAP measurements. Consequently, there are situations in which FRAP is unable to provide useful information regarding whether a compartment is a distinct liquid phase. The assay becomes troublesome if recovery rates spanning roughly three orders of magnitude can all be read as LLPS. FRAP alone is unable to discriminate between a discrete liquid droplet and a group of molecules produced by several different methods (see Table 2, Figures 50 and 51).
7. APPLICATIONS
Deep questions raised by the phenomenon of coacervation are influencing other developing fields in polymer physics, materials engineering, and biophysics as well as being influenced by them. Complex coacervates are a diverse class of materials used in everything from coatings and adhesives to pharmaceutical technologies. They also serve as the basis for numerous biological processes that are only just now starting to be understood. Due to their sensitivity to molecular structure and chemical identity, it is clear that the electrostatic interactions that drive complex coacervation are broadly relevant in the context of these larger trends in soft matter. Complex coacervation has garnered a lot of attention due to its relevance to numerous biological processes, including the self
assembly of biological macromolecules.543−545 The outlook of coacervation thus lies at the intersection of polymer science, molecular engineering, and biology. Due to their intriguing bulk material and interfacial properties, complex coacervates find use in a variety of industrial applications, including the pharmaceutical and food industries. Complex coacervates have applications in microencapsulation, drug delivery and tissue
engineering,546−553 biomaterials,71,511,554 underwater adhe
sives,555−557 protein purification,558 enzyme immobilization,559
cosmetic formulations,560 flavors,561 and oil562,563 with
applications in biomedical adhesives,305 food science,173 and
electronic ink.564 There has recently been resurgence in interest in coacervation due to these applications and some
fascinating biological implications.565 We highlight a few approaches that demonstrate the use of coacervate-based materials throughout the broad field of biomedicine in the sections that follow. 7.1. Encapsulation. The capacity of complex coacervates to accommodate a wide range of so-called client molecules is
one of their most intriguing features.566 By encapsulating proteins and other small molecules inside the coacervate phase, this property has been used to study biological processes in an
easy-to-understand and tightly regulated setting.347,566−569 Specifically, in aqueous solution, complex coacervates show
extremely low interfacial energy,67,570 a characteristic that
allows them to absorb a wide range of substances.121 As papers and patents date back to the 1970s, encapsulation was among
the earliest uses of acacia gum−gelatin coacervates.248 Gelatin’s distinct gelling−melting profile produces intriguing microencapsulation properties. Viscous coacervates can be made at 50−60 °C, which is higher than the gelatin gel point. As the interface cools, its rigidity increases, creating a stable gelled shell that encloses the microcapsule. Gelatin easily melts in the mouth during consumption, which will disturb the shell. Since then, a variety of liquid and/or solid materials have been
encapsulated using these two macromolecules.571−574 Just lately, in order to encapsulate flavors that would be released
during baking, Yeo et al.575 employed gelatin−acacia gum coacervates. Complex coacervation has advantages over spray drying, the most popular microencapsulation method, including high encapsulation efficiency (up to 99%), high “core” material loading (>50%), and significantly improved
controlled-release characteristics.576 For the use of coacervatebased synthetic cells in the biomedical field, the capacity to sequester large amounts of biologically significant macromolecules is also crucial. Encapsulation of cargo in complex coacervates has actually been proven effective in a number of biomedical fields, including the creation of sensors, nano

reactors, biomimetic adhesives, and delivery systems,515,577 as well as in the fields of food science and medicine.578−595 It is possible to achieve encapsulation by using the cargo as a component of the coacervate matrix,596 through particular interactions,597 or through preferential partitioning.598−602 In all of these instances, coacervation has two key advantages: (i) the capacity to carry out encapsulation in a purely aqueous environment,71,92,603−606 and (ii) the potential to significantly enrich the target molecule in the macromolecule-rich coacervate phase in comparison to the initial solution. By using these techniques, cargo is significantly enhanced and
protected inside the aqueous environment while also being given the option of a controlled release following the dissociation of the coacervate phase or in response to outside triggers.607,608 Overall, the creation of novel delivery methods has a lot of potential thanks to the development of programmable complex coacervate−synthetic cells, so long as those methods are compatible with living cells.609 Tests must be performed after encapsulation to see if the guest molecules were harmed by the coacervation process. Instead of small molecules, proteins need to take this into account more, and it can be tested using spectroscopic techniques like circular
Figure 51. (A) McSwiggen et al.460 reported a bar graph that quantifies the usage of descriptive or phenomenological criteria in the investigations, separating the tests conducted on the endogenous protein (knock-in, KI) from those conducted in overexpression (OE) systems. The number of proteins from the 33 studies that were said to provide that proof is represented by the x-axis. (B) An illustration of an experiment showing fluorescence recovery following photobleaching. A powerful laser is used to bleach the fluorescent molecules in a single area of the cell, allowing the signal to gradually rebound. Simple diffusion just uses diffusion to control the mixing of bleached and unbleached molecules, as is to be expected in a liquid such as a phase-separated domain. Diffusing molecules will mix before bound molecules may unbind and trade in the event that some molecules bind to an immobile element. (C) The extent and pace of signal recovery are affected differently by binding and diffusion. The most basic way to assess FRAP data is to calculate the recovery half-life (t1/2). Modulating the bleach spot size (dashed circles in B) will not impact the recovery (dashed lines) if the molecule being studied has a high rate of diffusion relative to its binding rate. The size of the bleach spot should have an impact on the curve’s t1/2 if diffusion, as suggested by LLPS, is the limiting factor. (D) t1/2 times reported from the research by McSwiggen et
al.460 Connected lines represent instances in which the same protein or protein domain has been measured more than once. A couple of these instances are tagged for ease of reference. The measurements on indigenous proteins are indicated by bolded circles, whereas the other measurements are conducted under conditions of overexpression. Adapted with permission from ref 460.

dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which are sensitive to the protein secondary structure. Coacervation, fortunately, preserves proteins in an aqueous environment while being a relatively gentle encapsulation technique. The negative effects of coacervation on protein structure have not
consistently been reported, and there is little evidence of
this.71,596,610
Charged proteins can be combined with diblock copolymers that have opposite charges to create complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms). However, due to the low charge density of proteins, these micelles frequently disintegrate at high ionic strengths. The most stable enzyme-containing C3Ms were demonstrated by Lindhoud et al. utilizing DLS. This was achieved by supplementing the two-component system with an excess of homopolymer with the same charge sign as the
protein, over the concentration of protein.93 There have been few systematic studies that examine how the molecular characteristics of small molecules drive encapsulation and/or modulate the phase behavior and properties of the coacervate itself, despite the fact that complex coacervates have a long history of applications related to the encapsulation of both
hydrophobic and hydrophilic cargo.71,611−624 The partitioning of small molecule dyes into various polymer-based coacervates is influenced by charge and hydrophobicity, as recently
demonstrated by work by Zacharia and colleagues.622,623 Because not all proteins of interest are strongly charged, encapsulating proteins within a coacervate phase can present a unique challenge. Recently, a method for dealing with the problem of binary protein−polyelectrolyte coacervates was reported. This work used conjugation chemistry to produce artificially supercharged proteins using succinic anhydride,
enhancing the natural charge state of various proteins.624 Moreover, the authors skillfully illustrated that the degree of supercharging required to produce coacervation (defined as the ratio of negative to positive charged groups, for subsequent coacervation with a polycation) is comparatively low, roughly 1.1 to 1.4. (Figure 52). Although the majority of studies on the complex coacervation of proteins utilize the charge of the protein,
Kapelner and Obermeyer625 have presented a method that
uses recombinantly expressed short ionic peptide tags (6−18 aa) to help with the complex coacervation-assisted phase separation of tagged proteins. The finding that proteins with the same total charge distributed isotropically on their surface exhibited less stability against salt dissolution than proteins whose coacervation with a strong PE was mediated by the presence of an ionic tag was particularly noteworthy. These findings point to several intriguing possible uses, including the colocalization of enzymes and the purification of proteins, among others. There have also been reports of ternary systems of coacervates being a successful protein encapsulation
technique.71,626 Using a ternary system of proteins and polymers enables the initial formation of an intermediate complex between the protein of interest and an oppositely charged PE, whose overall charge is dominated by the PE, rather than depending on the charge of the protein itself to
drive coacervation.627 Subsequently, the introduction of an additional PE causes aggravation by means of direct interaction
with the intermediate complex (Figure 53).71 Although ternary
composition space has not been thoroughly explored, early reports indicate a trade-off between total protein loading and encapsulation efficiency, which makes sense considering the requirement to preserve charge neutrality in the coacervate phase. Investigating the ternary composition space further is an exciting field to explore. 7.2. Delivery Platforms. Numerous instances of ionically cross-linked colloidal PE coacervates�mostly designed for biomedical applications�are documented in the literature, building on the advantages of complex coacervation for encapsulation. More recently, the use of naturally occurring polymers like heparin, chitosan, and alginate in complex coacervation systems has been investigated for drug
delivery.628,629 For example, chitosan/nucleic acid polyplexes were created to deliver DNA or RNA to mammalian cells in
vitro.630−632 Comparing hybrid PEGylated nanoparticles to conventional carriers, it has been demonstrated that the latter increase in vivo gene transfection efficiency. This is due to the
complex coacervation mechanism.633 In contrast, recent reports have described the use of polypeptide complex coacervation for protein encapsulation in the delivery of
protein therapeutics.71 The formulation and delivery of growth factors and monoclonal antibodies have benefited from complex coacervates’ capacity to hold high concentrations of
aggregation-free, fully active proteins. Li et al.634 demonstrated the application of zein−chitosan complex coacervate particles
in curcumin’s slow release. Ren et al.635 examined the zein− chitosan complex coacervation to look into the impact of ultrasonic frequency in the encapsulation of resveratrol. Li et
al.636 investigated the thermodynamics and wetting kinetics of

zein coacervate. Their research also demonstrated how zein coacervate may encapsulate limonene and how it forms in a water/propylene glycol solvent. For the delivery of the
anticancer medication bortezomib, Lee et al.637 employed injectable hydrogel coacervate. Iron cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose complex coacervate beads for the prolonged release
of ibuprofen were described by Huei et al.638 A dextran-based
coacervate nanodroplet was described by Chenglong et al.639 as a potential gene carrier for effective cancer therapy. Barthold
et al.640 revealed the existence of an anionic and cationic watersoluble starch derivative polymer that coacervates to produce nanoparticles. The researchers discussed about using nanoparticles to transport proteins and peptides into the lungs. When bolusstyle distribution (i.e., direct application or injection of the material to the location of interest) is possible, bulk and hydrogel-like coacervate-based materials are often the most helpful. For instance, coacervate-based hydrogels made of
alginate and chitosan have been demonstrated to increase cell proliferation in vitro while speeding wound healing and closure in a rat model.641 In a different set of reports, the glycosaminoglycan heparin was combined with the cationic polymer poly(ethylene argininylaspartate diglyceride) (PEAD) to create coacervate-based delivery vehicles that take advantage of the high binding affinity between heparin and various growth factors to enable cargo encapsulation and protection. Applications include the use of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) to improve angiogenesis in both surface wounds and after myocardial infarction (Figure 54), bone morphogenetic protein-2 to promote stem cell differentiation and bone formation, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1a for vascular regeneration, nerve growth factor for nerve regeneration, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) to speed-up wound healing, and the anti
inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10).642−648

Compared to conventional treatment methods, the use of the coacervate FGF2 formulation dramatically decreased the infarct area, prevented ventricular dilatation, and preserved cardiac fibers. Cardiomyocytes in the infarct zone are better preserved in the FGF2 coacervate treatment, according to α-actinin stained tissues. Adapted with permission from ref 644. Copyright 2013, Elsevier Ltd.

A highly intriguing piece of research was conducted by Lim
et al.649 while examining the effectiveness of coacervates in medication delivery. They demonstrated that a biomimetic peptide coacervate generated from the beak of a Humboldt squid may be used to efficiently encapsulate insulin and control
its release. Sato et al.650 described using chitosan-based coacervates for propolis encapsulation, release, and cytotoxic action. Beyond the advantages linked to the delicate encapsulation of biomolecules, the absence of organic solvents in coacervation has additional advantages in the context of drug delivery. In general, drug delivery platforms address a number of concerns, such as (i) cargo protection and/or isolation, (ii) permitting targeted distribution and absorption into the cells or tissues of interest, and (iii) controlled release of medicines over time. Coacervation as the foundation of a drug delivery platform has been shown to be effective in numerous papers, which address each of these issues by utilizing the adaptable and modular qualities of charge-driven
self-assembly. Bulk complexes651−654 and micellar87,655−660
systems for the delivery of plasmid DNA, microRNA,655 and
siRNA405 are examples of coacervate-based platforms for gene delivery that have been reported. These methods target specific
diseases like atherosclerosis655 and cancer.660 The problem of cargo protection frequently coexists with methods to speed cellular absorption. As an illustration, the majority of non-viral methods for delivering genes rely on the electrostatic complex creation of negatively charged DNA or RNA and a positively
charged carrier polymer, lipid or surfactant.661−664 Such
complexation aids in defense against nuclease attack.655,666
By disguising the negative charge of the DNA or RNA665 and promoting an alluring contact with the negatively charged cellular membrane, the positively charged carrier materials also
aid in cellular uptake.666 Food scientists have lately started adapting older concepts where complex coacervation has been employed to entrap tastes and oils for the delivery of proteins, nutraceuticals, and other water-soluble actives, even though the idea of targeted delivery is normally associated with medical
applications.667−669 Materials design tactics are being used to enable more effective absorption of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidant compounds during digestion, just as delivery
platforms in biomedicine can be used to promote uptake.594,595 Regarding biocompatibility, the availability of large amounts of food-grade materials, cost, and the requirement to produce a delectable product, the design parameters are constrained in this case.
7.3. Adhesive Technology. Even though adhesive technology has been around and used since the middle
Pleistocene, it is rarely used in harsh conditions.670 The majority of commercially available adhesives fall short of meeting bonding strength requirements and do not operate as
intended in wet and dynamic situations.671,672 The number of surgical operations conducted annually increases to a large amount. According to a recent survey, there were over 300 million procedures conducted in 2012, up 33.6% over the
previous 8 years.673,674 No tissue adhesive that satisfies all the criteria, such as simple delivery, quick setting time, strong adhesive and cohesive characteristics, and biocompatibility, has
yet been authorized for clinical use.675,676 Due to these challenges, current surgical closure techniques use invasive methods like sutures, staples, or clips, which frequently result in secondary tissue damage, microbial infection, fluid or air leakage, and poor cosmetic outcomes. In contrast, adhesive technology has been applied to medicine primarily for stopping
bleeding and adhering skin externally.677 The incidence of such problems would be drastically decreased with the invention of efficient surgical glues. A second, mainly untapped approach to the creation of surgical glues is based on complicated
coacervation,306,678−683 a process that is involved in the processing of the underwater adhesives used by various species
to connect to various surfaces.684−686 The sandcastle worm and mussels are two examples of natural systems where coacervate-based adhesives were originally discov
ered.306,687−690 The coacervation phenomenon was observed to be crucial in the development of adhesive in a wet environment in the case of sandcastle worms and
mussels.688,690−692 Complex coacervates are oppositely charged PECs that are polymer-rich, insoluble in water, and have a low surface tension that makes them compliant with
surfaces.77,570 After delivery, additional interactions are necessary to convert the viscous liquid into a sturdy material
and stop it from flowing when a tension is applied.306 Complex coacervates based on biomacromolecules have been found to offer excellent potential as wet adhesives through re
search.555,580
A number of research teams have used complicated coacervation’s electrostatic interactions to create viscous glues, the majority of which set underwater due to covalent cross-linking processes, giving them the strength needed to
resist separation.689,693−697 Coacervates have larger water content than other compounds because extra tiny ions are hydrated. The mechanical characteristics and adhesive performance of all water-containing adhesives are largely dependent on the water content. To improve adhesion performance, the water content must be optimized, which
also affects the concentration of the polymer.306,557,691,696,698 Commercial poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based glues, like DuraSeal and CoSeal, for instance, bind to tissues with a weak adhesive strength, which is mostly due to the high water
content, which ranges from 90% to 99% w/v.699 Water can also operate as a plasticizer, which can enhance the effectiveness of
adhesion.700 Poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)/poly(ethylene glycol) (PVP/PEG) blends’ adhesive characteristics were investigated
by Feldstein et al. in relation to water concentration.701,702 The material could withstand more deformations without significantly impacting its ultimate tensile strength because the water content and adhesion were raised and PEG content was increased. With the mode of failure switching from adhesive to cohesive and enabling fibrillation within the material, the PEG content was increased to 36%, which resulted in the best performance in terms of peel force. Due to the immiscibility of complex coacervates in water and the adhesiveness of mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs), attempts have been undertaken more recently to create an effective underwater adhesive utilizing MAP-based complex
coacervates.703 MAP-based encapsulated coacervates were created by Lim and colleagues as smart tissue adhesives with the capacity to transport drugs. In this study, cationic recombinant hybrid MAPs (fp-131 or fp-151) and anionic HA complex coacervated to generate an adhesive. On aluminum surfaces, coacervates bulk adhesive strengths were
twice as strong as the protein itself.304 In order to acquire rfp-1 MAP (AKP-SYPPTYK) for hydrogel creation by coordination
(Fe3+) or covalent cross-linking (NaIO4), Cha and colleagues employed the recombinant expression approach. When cross
linked with Fe3+ and NaIO4, the hydrogel system displayed maximum adhesion strengths of ∼130 and ∼200 kPa,

respectively. The therapeutic use of these sticky hydrogels is
restricted by the difficulties in producing the rfp’s in bulk.704 In a different investigation, they created recombinant MAPs (dfp3 and dfp-5) with residue-specific DOPA incorporations that had up to 23 mol% DOPA concentration. The recombinant protein demonstrated notable water resistance as well as robust
dry and submerged adhesion.705 Additionally, employing a photo-oxidative reaction with recombinant MAP and sodium persulfate (SPS) as the oxidizing agent in the presence of blue
light involving Ru(II)bpy32+ as the activator, they created a light-activated, mussel protein-based bioadhesive (LAMBA) hydrogel. In addition to promoting wound healing in addition to wound closure in a rat model, LAMBA also showed high
adherence to moist porcine skin.706 In order to create a hybrid molecular adhesive, Lu and colleagues combined CsgA proteins from E. coli amyloid-based adhesives with Mfps from mussel adhesives (monomeric CsgA-Mfp3; Mfp5-CsgA and copolymer constructions, (CsgA- Mfp3)-co-(Mfp5-CsgA)) (Figure 55). The molecular hybrid, in which the disordered Mfp’s were exposed on the exterior and the β-sheet amyloid protein served as the center, self-assembled. With an
exceptional adhesion energy of 20.9 mJ/m2, the (CsgAMfp3)-co-(Mfp5-CsgA) copolymer proved to be a formidable
rival for use in medical adhesives.707 Another class of tissue adhesives that draws inspiration from examples of adhesion in nature is known as “biomimetic adhesives” and is quickly gaining popularity in the field of biological adhesives. Stewart and colleagues used alternating anionic and cationic block copolymers to explain an electrostatically driven coacervate synthesis. These block copolymers are functionalized with amine, phosphate groups, divalent cations, and dihydroxyl aromatic groups for oxidative cross
linking in order to replicate caddisfly silk.708 Such adhesives are mostly used in the biomedical fields of bone, implants,
cartilage, and tissue repair.580,687,709−717 One iatrogenic defect in a fetal membrane patch was sealed in vitro using coacervatebased adhesives made of poly(acrylamide-co-aminopropyl methacrylamide)−poly(ethylene glycol diacrylate) and poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphate dopamine methacrylamide)−poly(ethylene glycol diacrylate). The adhesives held up well and could tolerate traction and turbulence without fluid
leaking or sliding.718 The glue was shown to be non-toxic in cytotoxicity tests and may help prevent iatrogenic pre-term
premature membrane rupture.718 Another instance involved doing craniofacial reconstruction on rats using a non-cytotoxic coacervate adhesive made of gelatin and phosphodopamine

they were given free range of motion after the glue was used to affix a piece of circular bone to the skull. Despite the animals’ freedom of mobility, the glue was seen to successfully hold the bone in place. In addition, as the adhesive material was absorbed by the body, new bone gradually took its place
without changing alignment.580 These and other instances have shown the potential of coacervate-based adhesives, but more in vivo research and ultimately clinical trials are required
to completely confirm their security and effectiveness.711 The ability to heal bone and tissue without the need to later remove the glue is one unique benefit of bio-inspired coacervate-based adhesives. A lot of work is being put into studying adhesion in natural systems because our understanding of underwater adhesion is still fairly restricted. There are many opportunities for further development of biomimetic tissue adhesives as we get a deeper understanding of the interactions between environmental and chemical variables, chemistries, and mechanisms of natural adhesion. Currently, coacervate production or functionalization with an adhesive group like DOPA, catechol, or
phosphates is required for biomimetic adhesives.719,720 Despite having good adhesion under dry conditions, these tactics
frequently fail when it is humid or wet outside.721 To balance the adhesive and cohesive strengths, recent investigations have looked at integrating a variety of cross-linking chemistries (see above). We have done a lot of study on tissue adhesives, but we have not been able to create imitations of natural adhesives that are scalable, nontoxic, biocompatible, simple to use, and degradable. It is still necessary to investigate how the chemistry of the backbone, the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of polymers, the mix of various amino acids, and charged side groups affect adhesion strengths. The application of adhesives must be expanded beyond tissue adhesion to include drug delivery, tissue grafts, wound healing, and tissue repair by the inclusion of peptides. Additionally, extensive research and clinical trials are required before these adhesives may be used in the medical or surgical fields. The storage, processing, and delivery of adhesive to the interface by marine organisms should be better understood in future research. In fact, one of the earliest examples of this is the biomimicry of sandcastle worm complex coacervate creation. To relate phase behavior to mechanical qualities as a function of pH, concentration, temperature, and ionic strength, additional research into coacervate production is required.
7.4. Protocells and Membraneless Organelles. Cell biology has a long history of complex coacervation. It is possible that the earliest protocells were elaborate coacervates of abiotic macromolecules that functioned as liquid reservoirs
for the earliest anabolic activities.120 The possibility that these phase-separated compartments could act as a kind of protocell that could serve as the foundation for the emergence of life has historically been a particularly contentious issue regarding
complicated coacervation.117,128,722−729 Despite the impact that this hypothesis, which was first proposed by Opar
in,505,724,729,730 has had on numerous studies on the origin of life, the significance of coacervates quickly declined, primarily because it appeared to be in sharp contrast to the existence of membranes that clearly divide cells into organelles and from one another as well as the presence of membranes that separate cells from the outside environment. The evidence supporting
the existence of MLOs has just lately begun to accumulate,124 and as a result, to organize the complexity of the intracellular
space, MLOs have also emerged in eukaryotes.731−733 They
have been demonstrated to represent a more dynamic method of isolating cellular components from the rest of the cell (sometimes momentarily and irreversibly). Membrane and MLOs can both be understood by analogy with an enclosed grape (a membrane organelle) and oil droplets in an aqueous solution, respectively. Thus, the public’s interest in Oparin’s
suggestion734 has been rekindled as a result of these findings, and fresh experimental attempts to study the origin of life have
resulted. For instance, Jia et al.735 created polyester droplets in 2019 using pre-biotically accessible α-hydroxy acids that will partition proteins and RNA in a manner consistent with originof-life conditions. More recently, it was demonstrated that phase separation may aid in the conversion of abiotic ornithine residues into arginines, enabling the synthesis of a protein that
binds dsDNA.736 In contemporary cell biology, it is understood that controlled intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation of bio-macromolecules plays essential roles in cytoplasmic organization, the construction of transitory signaling com
plexes, and the sequestration of metabolic processes.737 Coacervate research has advanced significantly over the past several years, in part due to the MLO field’s quick advancements and the necessity for model systems that are straightforward enough to allow systematic and quantitative exploration of MLO properties. The nucleolus and germ granules are just two examples of the vast and still poorly understood array of phase-separated subcellular structures
represented by MLOs.133,518,738,739 These vital organelles are created by the process of complex coacervation, which is the interaction of charged PEs such proteins and nucleic acids,
during LLPS.133 Due to the constant internal diffusive rearrangement of the coacervate material and the exchange of components with the environment, MLOs exhibit liquid-like material properties and have a tendency to be very
dynamic.214,518,740 Numerous RNA and protein-based cyto
plasmic and nucleoplasmic MLOs, including nucleoli741 and P
granules,518 have been described as having liquid phase
properties.738,742−749 Increasingly more MLOs, such as Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles, para-speckles, and PML bodies in the nucleoplasm, stress granules, and germ granules in the
cytoplasm, are candidates for liquid phase separation.750,751 Coacervates have a clear potential to imitate the material characteristics, hierarchical structure, and sequestration of MLOs because they both form through LLPS and are motivated by the same attractive interactions. This has
motivated scientists to create synthetic cells752 and artificial
organelles737,753,754 that can replicate particular biological properties like compartmentalization and communication by taking advantage of the self-assembling and packed nature of
coacervates.755,756 Phase-separated and coacervate-like materials have been discussed more and more in relation to cellular compartmentalization, beyond the historical debate. The discovery of a huge variety of membraneless cellular compartments that use LLPS to drive functionality is the result of advancements in imaging and labeling techniques. Such compartmentalization has often been linked to interactions between oligonucleotides and IDPs. It has been discovered that cells can stop some metabolic pathways while keeping the enzymatic equipment for later use by forming stress
granules.757 Granule production has also been linked to
nucleoli, which are transcriptional sites738,758−761 and sites of
ribosome biogenesis (Figure 57a,b).73,738 According to Stoeger
et al.761 there is an intrinsic unpredictability to chemical interactions that manifests as “noise” that obstructs cellular

AT


functions and communication. Molecular systems can be spatially partitioned to eliminate noise while maintaining controlled and predictable cell-to-cell variations. Furthermore, cellular compartmentalization can function well without consuming a significant quantity of energy. Ultimately, it was discovered that the eukaryotic cell nucleus’s passive noise
filtering improved the transcriptional output’s predictability.761 Aberrant phase transitions have also been linked to illness states in addition to the possible advantages of compartmentalization. It has been demonstrated that FUS, an IDP that resembles a prion and is linked to the neurodegenerative illness ALS, forms liquid compartments as a result of stress and/or DNA damage. However, aging studies showed that mutations in ALS linked to FUS resulted in a faster transition from liquid
to solid (Figure 57c).72 While it should be highlighted that not
all MLOs are formed through complicated coacervation,73 there is a lot of room for parallel research in the area between pure biology and pure materials science. Coacervation provides compartmentalization, which can be used to define reaction chambers at the micro- or nanoscale. Enzymes have been captured in coacervate droplets and coacervate-core micelles to form nanoreactors and potentially improve the reaction efficiency and/or operational stability of
the protein-encapsulated enzymes.762−764 In one instance, encapsulated trypsin was found to have a stronger temperature
tolerance and a faster reaction rate than native trypsin.762 Another illustration is the possible use of such constructions for the encapsulation of enzyme replacement therapy. As an alternative, these reactors can enable in situ chemical synthesis by selectively absorbing nanoparticles or other tiny mole
cules.764,765 For instance, pro-drugs could be activated on-site at tumor tissue sites using nanoreactors containing poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(α,β-aspartic acid) (PEG-b-PAsp)
and homo-catiomer poly([5-aminopentyl]-α,β-aspartamide)
(Homo-PAsp-AP).764 MLOs have a variety of functions in controlling cellular biochemistry, and problems with them are linked to disorders characterized by protein aggregation, such
as Alzheimer’s disease.766−769 It is becoming increasingly obvious that LLPS, primarily by the process of complex coacervation, plays an important role in an especially wide variety of cellular processes like selectively selecting particular biomolecules, DNA compaction and chromatin organization, control of transcription, control of polarity, control of stress, control of cell signaling, control of cell adhesion, endocytosis, and photosynthesis, with new examples being discovered at a
rapid rate.770−783 While many additional concerns are only now beginning to be researched, some functionalities, such as sequestering and concentrating particular molecules to aid biological activities, are recurring and established themes. For instance, it is still very unknown if and how MLOs physically alter their local environment, such as mechanically remodel membranes. Although it has not yet been extensively researched, the interaction between MLOs and membranes is growing in popularity. Recent research has demonstrated the function of coacervates in endocytosis and cell adhesion, highlighting the potential for MLOs to exert pressures on lipid mem
branes.783,784 The liquid-like P granules that function as mRNA exporters in Caenorhabditis elegans have been shown to
directly moisten the nuclear membrane,785 potentially improving transport. Phase-separated protein clusters that are membrane-bound have also been demonstrated to be engaged in a number of signaling pathways, regulating signal trans
duction and attracting cytoskeletal components.706,786−789 These latest investigations show that MLOs do mechanical
labor as well as other previously unrecognized tasks.790 Coacervates that are bound to the membrane may act as concentrated locations for the synthesis of lipids or membrane proteins. Because of their close association with the membrane, they may even be designed to perform transmembrane transport that would normally need sophisticated machinery. The interactions between cell-sized compartments and condensates may take on more complex forms as coacervatemembrane research advances. The lack of chemical and compositional richness in most modern coacervate models, however, explains why there is still a difference between coacervates in MLOs in terms of selectivity, control, and metastability. The intrinsic limits of coacervates and the gaps that currently exist between coacervates and MLOs must be identified in order to perhaps spur more investigation. A single form of interaction, such as charge complexation, is what causes the phase separation in the majority of coacervate models, which are based on compositionally straightforward components. In contrast to many MLOs, which frequently contain several co-assembled proteins, each with a particular arrangement of amino acids and the possibility for interactions, they lack the chemical and compositional richness. The superior selectivity, actively controlled production and disintegration, and even the metastability observed in some MLOs are all largely explained by this complexity. Reconstituted and designer proteins are successfully employed to produce in vitro droplets with the same molecular composition as MLOs in order to better replicate these characteristics of
MLOs.791,792 Numerous de novo synthesized peptides with adjustable coacervation properties were created using the concepts of polymer coacervation. Dzuricky bridged the gap

between condensates in vitro and in vivo by methodically examining the coacervate phase behavior and offering vital insights into the relationship between sequence and coacervate
features.356 The distinction between coacervates and (manufactured) MLOs gradually disappears as complexity rises, and the more protein-based coacervate droplets will be able to replicate MLO properties. We will be able to determine the level of complexity necessary to replicate each MLO property by employing such a bottom-up strategy. The fact that the cellular environment is out of homeostasis is another key component that has up to now been absent from virtually all in
vitro models.793 Because cells are inherently active, cytoskeletal structures, protein complexes, and MLOs are formed, stabilized, and arranged according to a constant turnover of
chemical energy.223 Active processes can fluidize MLOs and actually mold them to change their physical state. They can
also maintain droplets stable or keep proteins soluble.794 It will be a significant task in the future years to recapitulate these processes in coacervate models in order to comprehend the underlying physical impacts, but the first steps have already been taken. An alternate method for using an UDPpolymerizing enzyme to produce enzyme-controlled active
coacervates was discussed by Spoelstra et al.795 This was also the first study to disclose the occurrence of temporary, nonspherical coacervate forms that varied with enzyme activity. Furthermore, Donau described the brief formation of active peptide−RNA coacervates in the presence of a carbodiimide
chemical fuel.796 It is the first time that active coacervate droplets without enzymes have been observed, and they exhibit developing self-dividing behavior just before dissolving. 7.5. Medical Science. The disruption of normal intracellular complex coacervation or gain of function mutations that result in abnormal complex coacervation can result in disease, to tie complex coacervation to medical research.
Benedek797 referred to cataracts and other illnesses connected to aberrant protein phase separation as “molecular condensation disease” to generically explain them. “Cold” cataracts are caused by the LLPS of cytoplasmic crystalline proteins, which results in reversible lens opacification. Another example is an illness known as protein condensation disorder, which is thought to be the primary cause of frontotemporal dementia. It is brought on by mistranslated arginine-rich dipeptide repeat proteins that insert or dissolve into liquid phase-defined
intracellular compartments, impairing their normal function.798 It is conceivable that improved knowledge of the physical chemistry behind complicated biomacromolecule coacervations and the function of particular functional groups will result in therapies for pathological intracellular phase separations. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a deadly neurodegenerative disease marked by a selective loss of motor neurons, and a subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), share the clinical hallmark of abnormal accumulation of TAR
DNA-binding protein43 (TDP-43).799 Many different RNAbinding proteins (RBPs), including TDP-43, spontaneously form granule-like structures via a LLPS process, according to a
recent spate of studies.800,801 Proteins and nucleotides abruptly separate into two distinct stages during LLPS, which allows for the development of intracellular organelles without mem
branes, such as p-bodies and stress granules.802−805 Under physiological circumstances, LLPS allows for the attainment of high local concentrations for molecular interactions and quick chemical reactions. It also permits fast molecule changes in response to signaling, thereby facilitating a variety of
intracellular biological processes, such as transcriptional
control and signal transduction.806 However, when too many proteins are present and LLPS is dysregulated, the complexes swiftly change into pathogenic inclusions that are frequently observed in neurodegenerative
disorders.807,808 FUS, TIA-1, and of course TDP-43 are among the ALS-causing gene products that are suggested to form aggregates via LLPS. According to recent research, optical multimerization of cytoplasmic TDP-43 causes endogenous nuclear TDP-43 to assemble and sequester itself into
cytoplasmic aggregates that are reliant on LLPS.809,810 The cytoplasmic aggregates of RBPs, mutant FUS, and TIA1 were dramatically dissociated by 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-Hd), as seen in Figures 58A and B. Sequestration of TDP-43 into the aggregates was greatly avoided, which is consistent with the reduced quantity of RBPs-induced aggregates (Figure 58C). These findings imply that RBPs and TDP43 co-aggregate in the cytoplasm as a result of LLPS. Contrarily, 1,6-Hd had no effect on the quantity of microtubule-related proteins (MRP) aggregates (mutant PFN1 and UBQLN2) or coaggregates with

Particularly in the cells expressing RBPs with 1,6-Hd, both the ratio of cells with TDP43 aggregates (B) and TDP-43 co-aggregation (C) were decreased.

An extension of GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat in the gene’s intron 1 causes the C9orf72 mutation. The G4C2 repeats 2− 23 times in unaffected individuals, but in those with the mutation, the pattern is extended to hundreds or thousands of
repeats.812,813 The mutation can cause levels of the protein it
encodes,814,815 which is implicated in the control of endolysosomal trafficking and autophagy, to decrease because of its
placement upstream of the coding area.816−818 The absence of neurodegeneration or TDP-43 pathology, a crucial pathogenic component of C9orf72-ALS/FTD (frontotemporal dementia), is a consistent observation from murine C9orf72 knockout
models.819−824 The principal clinical manifestations of C9orf72-ALS/FTD are now largely explained by a change in the behavior of proteins and RNA involved in the creation of liquid-like MLOs during phase separation (Figure 59). Gainof-function mechanisms connected to the G4C2 repeat expansion in C9orf72-G4C2 repeat RNA and the argininerich DPRs poly-GR and poly-PR undergo phase separation and
disrupt the phase separation of LCD (low-complexity sequence domains) containing proteins, causing abnormal MLO formation and dissolution that compromises their physiological functions and causes neurodegeneration. The main pathological feature of C9orf72-ALS/FTD correlating with neuronal cell death is TDP-43 malfunction and aggregation, which is further pathological phase separation brought on by the arginine-rich DPRs. A unique approach for potential therapies involves employing small compounds or gene therapy to target abnormally phase separated condensates. However, in order to create targets that are both useful and precise, a deeper
knowledge of phase separation is required.825
8. RECENT DISCOVERIES ON COACERVATE DROPLET STUDIES
The similarity between coacervates, biological systems, and
protocells is currently being rekindled by recent findings.826 On the one hand, in contrast to the standard membrane-bound organelles seen in eukaryotic cells (such as the nucleus, mitochondria, or the Golgi apparatus), a novel class of
Figure 59. How TDP-43 aggregation in C9orf72-ALS/FTD may be caused by interference with phase separation and membraneless organelles, as well as potential treatment options. (1) Nuclear pore proteins with phenylalanine-rich repetitions (FG domains) bind C9orf 72 arginine rich DPRs and G4C2 repeat RNA, which impairs nucleocytoplasmic transport and mislocalizes TDP-43 to the cytoplasm. (2) The LLPS of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm is caused by an interaction between cytoplasmic TDP-43 and the arginine-rich DPRs. Impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport also causes a buildup of the importin-α/β complex, which binds to the arginine-rich DPRs and reduces their solubility. This complex is the import receptor for TDP-43. A vicious feedback loop is set off as a result of the increased amounts of cytoplasmic TDP-43, whose LLPS is amplified by nuclear retention of mRNA as a result of reduced nuclear export of TDP-43. (3) Phase separation and the development of stress granules are aided by cellular stress, as well as by the direct interaction of arginine-rich DPRs and G4C2 RNA with stress granule proteins (including TDP-43) in living cells. The arginine-rich DPRs also cause importin-α/β to condense. Nuclear TDP-43 is depleted as a result of increased cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation and the recruitment of importin-α/β complexes and nuclear pore proteins by TDP-43 droplets. The cytoplasmic TDP-43 and the buildup of stress granules both promote the RAN translation of the arginine-rich DPRs. (4) The reduced dynamics of the stress granules produced by the arginine-rich DPRs and repetitive RNA trap TDP-43, import receptors, and nuclear pore proteins. TDP-43 and DPR-importin-α/β persistent droplets are anticipated to develop into hydrogels, which would further immobilize these proteins. (5) TDP-43 matures into pathogenic insoluble aggregates that further sequester proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport in solid-like states, stress granules, and DPRs. Therefore, the loss of nuclear TDP-43 and its accumulation and aggregation in the cytoplasm in sickness are caused by the disruption of phase separation and membraneless organelles, which sets off a chain reaction of negative feedback loops. (6) Therapeutic targeting of stress granules may improve TDP-43 solubility, aid in reducing its aggregation, and alleviate the pathological cascade in C9orf 72-ALS/FTD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies by lowering ataxin-2 levels, adjusting post-translational modifications like methylation of the DPRs and phosphorylation of TDP43, or increasing importin-α/β to reduce excessive LLPS.

intracellular organelles lacking a lipid membrane has been
discovered in the past 10 years.518 These MLOs, which are also known as biomolecular condensates, are formed in cellulo by an associative LLPS process that involves polynucleotides and
proteins.135 They are similar to coacervate droplets in many
aspects (see “Protocells and Membraneless Organelles”).136,827 However, studies showing that coacervates could host catalytic
reactions828 and assemble from low-molecular-weight species
instead of polymers121,829,830 (including molecules that are relevant to biology or pre-biotics like oligopeptides and mononucleotides) have rekindled interest in the role of these
droplets as protocells.831,832 More sophisticated ensembles are being built thanks to the invention of coacervates that resemble protocells or organelles. The unique characteristics of coacervates present promising opportunities for the synthesis of synthetic cells from the bottom up. Numerous illustrative studies have begun to explore their role as cytosol-like chassis or organelle-like modules, highlighting the potential of these chemically rich and congested droplets to support a variety of bioinspired functions in limited spaces. LLPS in synthetic cells provides unparalleled opportunity to research processes occurring in real cells in well-controlled conditions, like the dynamic behaviors and functions of biomolecular condensates, by utilizing the power of biomimicry. Longer forward, developing integrated synthetic cells that take advantage of the unique properties of coacervate microdroplets may open up new avenues for environmental cleanup or therapeutic applications. Achieving coacervates’ programmability and scalability in synthetic cells seems to be an essential first step toward their
effective incorporation into applications.833 Xu et al. have recently announced the most integrated coacervate-templated
synthetic cells.834 Using confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging in conjunction with statistical fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) screening, it was first shown that PDDA/ ATP complex coacervates could spatially position two strains of bacteria at different locations. Live Escherichia coli bacteria were spontaneously captured within the droplets, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa adsorbed at the coacervates interface. The bacteria’s biological contents were released into the coacervate matrix as a result of their biochemical lysis, and pieces of lipid bilayer formed a semipermeable shell surrounding the droplets. The bacterial DNA could be broken up and condensed using histone and CM-dex into a structure that resembled a nucleus and contained a wealth of DNA. Bacterial enzymes trapped in the as-formed membranized coacervate droplets remained active. Actin polymerization driven by ATP was also observed in the constructions. Surprisingly, live E. coli was also inserted into the coacervate droplets to function as mitochondria substitutes and generate chemical energy for extended periods of time in the form of ATP. It was remarkable that this energization caused the spherical coacervate droplets to shift morphologically into amoeba-like shapes. This was explained by the extended metabolic activity of the imprisoned bacteria, which changed the coacervates’ interfacial characteristics. The ability to create self-contained compartments by interacting living cells with coacervates is demonstrated by this example. Further research must examine different design methodologies to incorporate artificial metabolic modules that can generate energy when connected to an external energy source (such light or nutrition) in order to create fully synthetic cells
independent of live systems.835 To create completely
integrated synthetic cells, a number of obstacles still need to be overcome. It is still unclear how exactly coacervate droplets are positioned inside compartments from an organelle-like standpoint. It will also be necessary to create novel instruments to precisely move molecules from one coacervate droplet to another, such as selective sequestration or reversible coacervate creation, in order to use distinct coacervate droplets to control metabolic fluxes and coordinate signaling cascades. Furthermore, how to accomplish synchronized growth and division of the enclosing compartment and coacervate organelles in order to complete symmetric division remains a mystery. It will be necessary to be able to contain incompatible enzyme reactions in distinct places in order to achieve both catabolic and anabolic reactions in the same compartment from the perspective of a cytosol-like template. In the end, coupling the internal operations of these coacervate-based synthetic cells to an external energy source�such as light or chemical
nutrients�will be necessary to power them.833
9. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
In this Review, we have demonstrated how recent developments in the science and engineering of complex coacervates have laid the groundwork for their practical use in a range of applications, from tunable material encapsulants to industrially useful viscosity modifiers to self-assembled functional materials. The mechanisms and kinetics of complex coacervation are poorly understood, few ideas have quantitative experimental evidence, phenomenology alone cannot predict coacervate stability, and equilibrium behavior is occasionally inconsistent. An active and significant area of research focuses on the mechanisms underlying the development of complexes between polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged colloids as well as coacervate structures at various length scales. Although coacervation mechanisms have been inferred from observations of self-organized microscopic structures, further research is still needed to determine the exact relationship between the coacervation mechanism and the resulting structure. More connections between experimental and theoretical work are still required. Phase behavior has been the main focus of many experimental attempts; however, this is not always a direct probe of molecular-level characteristics including charge correlations, charge density effects, excluded volume, and particular ion effects. This makes it challenging to discern between VO theory and more complex theories, which is why experimentation is not frequently used as a comparison tool. In contrast, there is a need on the theoretical side to broaden the range of models applicable to the coacervate-driven assembly that is at the cutting edge of the field’s experimental effort. Collaboration will hasten the convergence on a comprehensive understanding of coacervation, which should allow polymer scientists to fully harness their complexity to create really innovative and biologically inspired materials. The creation of more intricate theories and models, as well as the incorporation of knowledge about the molecular structure of materials based on coacervate, are required for higher levels of comprehension. For instance, the author is aware of very little theoretical research on the rheological behavior of coacervates. This is true despite the fact that rheology is frequently used as
a tool to describe coacervates.196,836 We can learn a lot more about this group of materials by using hybrid techniques like simultaneous small-angle X-ray or small-angle neutron scattering combined with rheo-optics, calorimetry, rheology
(rheo-SAXS/SANS), and/or other approaches.318,411,448,837,838

The continued development and validation of theoretical hypotheses to match observation with molecular models will be necessary for the subsequent interpretation of the obtained data. For instance, additional testing of the “sticky” Rouse
model proposed by Spruijt et al.313,448 would be possible, thanks to the systematic linear viscoelastic investigation of polymer chemistry impacts on complex coacervation. These initiatives might also be combined with improvements in the general modeling of coacervation. Because such measurements have a strong theoretical foundation, it is significant to emphasize that the vast bulk of experimental and theoretical efforts have concentrated on understanding small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) data. From the standpoint of applications, the majority of processing procedures subject materials to deformations, however, that go much beyond the capabilities of linear viscoelasticity. Theoretical analyses of polymer behavior that include the non-linear large-angle oscillatory shear (LAOS) domain have a great deal of potential to reveal fundamental principles behind the massive disruption and rearrangement of polymer networks. Future work will need to address the use of such non-linear methods to the characterization of intricate coacervate-based materials. A class of materials called polyelectrolyte coacervates and complexes is being employed
more frequently for self-assembly.164,836,839−841 However, there are significant theoretical difficulties in comprehending. Complex coacervates, including multiple length scales, kinetic traps, highly correlated electrostatics, dielectric, glassy dynamics, water, and specific ion effects, are among the most important challenges in polymer modeling
today.10,149,164,376,842−847 Some but not all of these concerns are often covered by the variety of contemporary theoretical approaches. While a patchwork of several theories can collectively account for a number of limiting circumstances, a complete picture of the theory reveals that no single explanation is able to concurrently address the entire range of traits found in complex coacervation. A coacervate theory would ideally be capable of foretelling coacervate qualities over a wide variety of factors and length scales. Pair correlation functions, for instance, could be used to describe how charges and even solvents are organized at the atomic and/or molecular level. The prediction would include larger length-scale impacts like phase behavior, total polymer conformation, and self-assembled structures. A thorough physical picture of coacervation should include observations of out-of-equilibrium behavior. Ideally, such a theory would offer a coherent conceptual understanding of coacervation that is helpful for the design of experiments with coacervate-based materials. We predict that in the future, emerging areas in both coacervation and starting points for extremely difficult questions in molecular engineering and chemical physics will include the need to take into account the role of hydration and atomistic detail, the potential for higher-order molecular selfassembly with sequence-defined polyelectrolytes, and the significance of non-electrostatic interactions in biology. Three yet poorly known characteristics of MLOs�dynamic assembly, client molecule partitioning, and reaction kinetics inside MLOs�are being addressed through cytomimetic methods. Coacervates are used as model systems to comprehensively examine these characteristics in vitro. To construct coacervate-based cytomimetic systems that fully capture the intricacy of spatiotemporal organization in cells, significant work must be made as the majority of coacervates
are still far from mimicking cellular MLOs. Such studies should be used in particular to clarify three aspects of MLOs that are still unclear: (1) How can MLO assembly and dissolution be controlled? (2) What principles govern the partitioning of biomolecules into MLOs? (3) How are reaction rates and other biochemical processes impacted by MLOs? Understanding the complexation process of multicomponent mixtures and controlling the structure and properties of the resulting material will provide additional ways to improve their functionality as multicomponent complexes made of polyelectrolytes, biomacromolecules, or other charged species (such as DNA and RNA) become more significant in materials and biomaterials research. In an effort to comprehend the hierarchical organization of the various distinct components seen in many MLOs, multicompartment coacervates have recently been produced based on ELPs with various chain
lengths,848 and various IDPs formed from nucleoli.223 How various coacervates or MLOs could survive in the same cytosol,
without mixing,223,849 as has long been known for many other multicomponent liquid mixtures, is a related question that has
not yet been empirically investigated.850,851 This could be related to amphipathic biomolecules that stabilize the liquid−
liquid interface by adhering to it,848,852 or it could be related to a continual turnover of coacervate material that is outside of thermodynamic equilibrium in order to prevent Ostwald
ripening.853 These characteristics represent the numerous difficulties on the path to synthetic organelles and cells. As a result, despite the community’s enormous efforts to date, polymer scientists�both experimentalists and theorists�still have limitless potential to find fascinating challenges in the study of complex coacervation.
