Dielectric Constant of Water from 0 0 to 1000 C
C. G . Malmberg and A. A. Maryott
An equal ratio arm, capacitance-conductance bridge, operated at frequencies below 100
kilocycles per second, was med to measure the dielectric constant of water with an accuracy
of better than 0.1 percent at 5-degree intervals over the range .0° to 100° C. At 25° C the
dielectric constant was found to have the value 78.30, which is about 0.3 percent lower than
t hat usually accepted. The data fit the equation
E= 87. 740 - 0.400081+ 9.398(10- 4)tL 1.410 (10- 6)13,
with a maximum deviation of 0.01 unit in dielectric constant. The experimental method
and sources of error are considered in some detail.
1. Introduction
Numerous determinations of the dielectric con
stant of water have been r eported in the literature
during the past half century. 1 However, much of
this work was not conducted with sufficient accuracy
to provide data adequate for reference purposes.
Several of the more recent investigators [1 ,2,3,4,5],2
employing varicd experimental techniques in which
the accuracy was stated or has been inferred to b e
of the order of 0.1 percent, report values that are in
close agreement at room temperature but not at
higher and lower temperatures. Discrepancies
amounting to a percent or more exist at higher
temperatures.
This investigation was undertaken to redetermine
the dielectric constant of water over the range 00 to
100 0 C with an accuracy better than 0.1 percent . A
low-frequency bridge method with a Wagner earth
to permit the use of three-terminal dielectric cells
was employed. The various methods of measure
ment, generally some form of bridge or resonance
method, are all more or less subject to errors assoc
iated with the residual impedances of the network
that are enhanced when the medium possesses
appreciable conductivity. The present assembly
has the advantage of facilitating the minimization,
ready control, and accurate evaluation of these
residual errors, and of simplifying certain problems
regarding the design of cells suitable for accurate
absolute measurements.
The values of dielectric constant reported in this
investigation are significantly lower than previously
assigned values l6], about 0.3 percent at 25 °, but the
variation of dielectric constant with temperature is
substantially the same as reported by Wyman and
Ingalls [5] except at the lowest temperatures.
2. Apparatus
The a-c bridge is of the equal-ratio arm, capaci
. tance-conductance type, with a Wagner earth.
The Wagner earth permits use of either two- or
three-terminal cells, and in conjunction with proper

shielding, either eliminates or fixes the influence of
ground admittances and interhranch couplings. A
schematic diagram of the circuit is shown in figure 1.
The basic network and its components, with the
exception of the unknown arm and standard capaci
tor, are substantially the same as those described
previously [7] .
The unknown arm contains a shielded 3,OOO-ohm
resistor, R, and a small capacitor, 0, in parfllel with
the guarded capacitance, Ox, of the test cell in order
to provide convenient "zero" settings for the stand
ards, Om and R4, of the measuring arm. Th e capaci
tance of the test cell is m easured in terms of Om by
connecting the cell in parvUel first with 0 and then
with Z5of the Wagner earth by means of the switch,
K . Tn the latter case the cell is effectively removed
from the main bridge circuit because its eartb
potential electrode is connected to ground, and
admittances from any corner of the bridge to ground
do not affect the condition s of balance.
FIGURE 1. Schematic diagram of the bridge circuit.


The three cells used were designed for "absolu te"
measurements, th e insulating supports being lo cated
where they should not affect the desired interelec
trode capacitances. Intercomparisons between the
three cells, using media of various dielectric con
stants, indicated that these capacitances varied
linearly with the dielectric constant of the medium.
Because accurate measurements become increas
ingly difficult as the conductivity of the medium
increases, the materials of construction of the two
cells, A and B, used with water, were selected to
minimize electrolytic contamination. Cell C was
used only for intercomparisons with liquids of lower
dielectric constant and conductivity.
Cell A is a fixed, three-terminal, cylindrical capaci
tor. A schematic drawing is shown in figure 2.
The base material is copper, with the electrode
surfaces coated with pure tin. The central, or high
potential, electrode, H, is supported by th e grounded
guard electrode, G. Electrical insulation and a
liquid-tight seal are provided by O.Ol-in. T eflon
gaskets on each side of the silvered copper spacer,
F , and by a Bakelite bushing on the upper sid e.
The high-potential terminal is electrostatically iso
lated from the case by the removabl e shield , S.
The guard electrode is supported on the outer case,
which, in part, serves as the earth-po tential electrode
D, by means of a Pyrex-glass ring and O.Ol-inch
Teflon gaskets, and held by six bolts insulated from
the guard electrode by Bakelite bushings. To prc
vent the trapping of gas in the annular space between
the guard and the earth potential electrodes when
the cell is being filled with liquid, four l-mm holes
were drilled through G at level E . .A Pyrex-glass
reservoir is attached to a silvered copper tube

extendin g from the bottom of the cell, as shown at
th e left of figure 3, to facilitate the introduction and
manipulation of fluids. Coaxial cable , with the
outer conductor grounded, connects the cell to the
appropria te bridge terminals. Couplin g between
the exposed, ear th-po tential electrode and other com
ponents of the network is prevented by proper
shielding. As lead, shield, and guard capacitances
are all effective directly to ground, only the capaci
tance between the test electrodes, D an d H, is
measured. This capacitance in air is about 34 fJ./-d .
Cell H, shown at the right in figure 3, is of the
differential type. It was constructed from a Gen
eral Radio type 568- D variable a ir capacitor modified
in several respects. The number of plates was re
duced to give a replaceable capacitance of about 28
fJ.fJ.f, and all metal surfaces were tinn ed. The steatite
insula tors were replaced with Pyrex glass and par
tially shielded to minimize any effect of the insulation
on the differential capacitance. The unit was
mounted in a gold-plated brass case. The rotor
control handle is variable between fixed stops
mounted on the cover. The high-potential stator
plates bracket th e earth-potential rotor plates when
interleaved to avoid varying the stray fields through
the insulating supports . Both arc isolated from the case except when the cell is used as a twoterminal capacitor. Then the rotor plates and the case are connected together. A comparison (table 1) of the values of dielectric constant obtained for a given medium when th e cell is used as both a twoand a three-terminal capacitor provides a check of the linearity of its replaceable in terval of capacitance with respect to dielectric constant. Any nonlinear effects associated with the insulatin g supports should differ in the two cases.

Cell C is also of the diO'e l'enLi al type, and similar
in design to cell B. It co nsists of a Ge neral Radio
type 539- J variable ail' capacitor, mounted in a
brass con tainer, and has a replaceable capacitance
of abou t 500 /lpf. Both electrodes are insulated
from th e case to p ermit usc as either a three- or a
two-termin al capacitor.
The standard capacitor, Om, is a General Radio
type 722- D variable precision capacitor wi th the
following modifications: The original wood case,
lined with sh eet copper , was replaced by a m etal
case to improve the stability of capacitance ; in
addition, an ex ternal worm and gear drivc was
mounted on th e panel to expand the scale anel to
allow a preeision of setting of 0.01 /l/lf on the 100 to
1,100 p/lf range. The capacity of this in terval was
assumed to be exact and was calibrated internally
in th e con lTentional stepwise m anner , using th e re
placeable air capacitances of cells A and R a nd other
larger anel smaller fixeel increments. Calibrations
malte several times during th e course of the measure
m ents on water and with th e differen t increme nts
were consiste nt to 0.05 /l/lf or b etter Lhroughou t the
range of the precision capacitor. The total backla~h
associated with the settin g of this capn.citor amoun ts
to abou t 0.005 /l/lf on th e 100 to 1,100 /l/lf range and
about one-ten th of this value on th e 25 to 110 /l/lf
range. :Mica capacitors, General Radio type 505,
were plugged to the terminals of th e precision
capaci tor to extend its range as needed . These were
calibra ted in terms of th e standard capacitor at th e
r equired frequencies, and over a period of a year
th eir capacitan ccs were found to remain co nstant to
beLter Lh an 0.01 percent.
The apparatus was con tain ed in a co nsLant-tem
perature room maintained at 23° C. The cells were
placed in a grounded oil ba th co ntrolled to b etter th an
0.01 deg and the temperatures ele tennill ed with a
platinum resistance thermometer. Cell A was im
merseel to within 1 inch of th e top and th e exposed
portion provided with adequate thermal shielding.
Experimental evidence showed th at withou t such
shielding, significan t thermal g ra dients existed within
th e cell at th e higher temperatures. Cells Rand C
were immersed so that the oil just covered th e lids
and were used only for m eas urements at 25 ° C. 3. Water
Distilled water was obtained as r equired from th e
regular supply piped to th e labora tory . This supply
i free of ammonia and has an average conductivity
of 0.5 micromho/cm at 25°, due mainly to dissolved
CO2 • Each sample was boiled in the test cell prior
to m easurement. This procedure was effective in
removing dissolved air in order both to eliminate th e
te ndency for bubbles to form between th e electrodes
and to r educe th e CO2 content, thereby decreasing
conductivity. An atmosphere of hydrogen was
th ereafter maintained in the cell. After thorough
cloaning and leaching of th e cell, it was possible to
keep the co nductivity of th e water in the range 0.1
Lo 1.7 micromho Jcm at all temperatures and to avoid
rapid drifts, which would interfere with th e precision
of capacitance balance.

If Ox is the true in terclectrod e capacitance of, t he
fixed , guarded cell, A , when filled with a m edium of dielectric constan t, €x, then

where 0. is the capacitance in vacuum, Ok the capaci
tance in air', and €k the dielectric constant of air. If
the residual impedances associa ted with the bridge
network are n egligibJy small , the inter electrode
capacita nce is obtained chrectly as t he difference in
capacitance of the standard capacitor, Om - O~,
wher e Om and C~ ar e the capacitances m easured
with the cell co nnected to the appropr iate bridge
termin als and with the ear th-potential electrode
connected directly to ground , respectiHly. In prac
tice, errors tha t may seriously limit Lbe accuracy of
Lhe measureme nts of dielectric co nsta nt can arise
from th e efl"ects of residual impedances associated
wi Lh the leads and components of the bridge circui t.
Although tb ese elTor s ca n be minimized by car eful
design of the n etwork and the selecLion of com
ponents, by opLimum choice of fr eq uency and cell
capacitance, and by avoiding excessively high con
du ctivities r e ulting from eleetroly tie contamination
of th e medium, it is often not feasible Lo reduce these
errors to n egligible propor tions, and procedures
must be devised for the ir evaluaLion.
If the admiLtances between each test elecLrode
and th e guard electrode of the cell arc neglected for
the moment, the actual network can be simulated
by that shown in figure 4. The effective capacitances
of the ratio arms are represented by Ol a nd O2, the
self-inductan ce of the standard condenser and its
leads by lm, the effective series inductance of tho

the inductance and resistance of the leads to the
cell by land r. The residual impedances associated
with the fixed 3,000-ohm r esistor, R, and small con
denser, C, of the unknown arm are neglected, as they
do not alter the error analysis to follow. The cell
capacitance is given by
where, neglecting terms of higher order,
Ca= (Ol - C2) (R d R 4- R 1/R D,

Oc= - 2rOx/Rx,
Od = w 2lm (0~ - 0~2) - w 2lC; ~w 2 (lm -l)0; .
Ce, the capacitance due to electrode polarization,
varies approximately as w- n , where w is the angular
frequency and n generally lies between 1.5 and 2 but
is virtually constant for a given experiment and
temperature. The unprimed symbols refer to the
case where the cell is connected in the normal man
ner, and the primed symbols to the case where the
earth-po tential electrode is connected directly to
ground.
The errors attributable to Cd and Ce, b eing func
tions of th e frequency , were eliminated in the fol
lowing manner. In each instance values of Om were
obtained at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 kc. A representa
tive plot of such data is shown by the solid line of
figure 5. At the lower frequencies the variation of
Om is due predominately to electrode polarization,
and the error associated with the lead inductances
is negligible or greatly minimized, whereas t he con
verse is true at the higher frequencies. The unbal
ance in lead inductances, lm- l, which amounted to

appropn~te correction made, as indicated by the
broken Ime of figure 5. Extrapolation of this latter
curve to infinite frequency then gives the cell capaci
tance, corrected for the frequency-dependent errors.
D eterminations of lm - l were made both during the
normal course of the measurements on water at the
lowest temperatures, where electrode polarization was
negli~ible at a~ but th e lowest frequencies, and by
plUgglllg suffiCIent capacitance in the form of the
mica standards across the emp ty cell and standard
condenser to cause a readily measurable change of
capacitance balance with frequency. The uncer
tainty in the value of the dielectric constant of water
associated with these corrections is defini tely less
than 0.01 unit.
. Of t.he remaining terms in eq (2) , Cc is not signif
lCant III th e present case as long as good electric
contacts are main tained. The sum of the errors
Ca+Cb, which depend upon the r esistance balance
was obtained by a modification of the pro cedUl'~
previously described [7]. The dielectric cell was
replaced by a conductivity cell of negligible capaci
ta~ce , 'with l kept very n early the sam e. The
reSIstance of the cell filled with distilled water was
then .decreased in small steps by the addition of a
solutlOn of K Cl. The change in Cm required to
rebalance the bridge was observed at about la-ohm
intervals. The entire range of R 4 required for the
measurements on water, namely, 1,000 to 3 000
ohms, was calibrated in this manner, using a 'fre
quency sufficiently high to avoid any effects of
electrode polarization. The range 1 000 to 2 600
ohms. was also ca.librated directly, ~sing cell' A .
In thIS case the r eSIstance was changed by the addi
tion or r emoval of small amounts of CO2• Both
calibrations were in satisfactory agreement. The
correction for Oa+ Cb, which , in the extrem e case,
amounted to about 0.07 uni t in dielectric constant,
should not lead to an uncertainty greater than
0.005 unit.
D etermination of the replaceable capacitance of
the cell when filled with dry air, Ok, was made as
part of the procedure employed for calibrating the
standard capacitor. Thus, Ok was equal to the total
interval of capacitance that could be covered in
integral step~ of .okdivided by the number of steps.
Four determlllatlOns of Ok, made at various times
dur~ng. the measurements on water, gave an average
deVIatlOn of 0.007 percent. The variation of OJ
with temperature was obtained from measurements
at.a number of temperatures in the range 0 to 100 0 ,
USlllg the low range of the standard condenser, where
a precisio~ of setting of 0.001 J.'J.'f was possibl e.
When Ok IS corr~cted ~o vacuum, using adequate
values for the dlelectn c constant of air [8] the
vacuum capacitance, 0., is given by ,
The change .with temperature is very nearly the
same as predIcted from the linear coefficient of
expansion of copper.

Determinations of the dielectric constant of water
were made in cell A at 5-deg intervals, using two
or more samples of water at each temperature. As
a further check on the correction for Oa+ Ob, the use
of sample of corresponding conductivity was avoid
ed. Without exception, t he value of dielectric constant obtained at each temperature agreed to 0.01 unit or better with respect to their m ean.
As an over-all ch eck on the accuracy of the m eas
urements with cell A, some additional experiments
were made at 25° 0, using auxiliary cells Band 0
both as two- and as three-terminal cells. The nature of the residual errors and th e procedures u sed in their evaluation are similar to those discussed
above for cell A. However, as these cells are of the
differential type, they require twice as many measUl'ements of capacitance and associated corrections.
The dielectric constant of water was redetermined
in cell B , whereas ethylene chloride and 2-ethyl
hexanol were m easured in cell O. The latter materials were of technical grade. The degree of purity
was immaterial as the sample was used for inter
compari on in cell A. The values of dielectric con
stant obtained with th e three cells are listed in table
1. The differences are quite negligible except in
thc case of water, where cell B gives a value about
0.03 percent larger than cell A. However, a the
experimental uncertainties associated with cell Bare
at least twice those of cell A, this difference is hardly ignifican t.

It is evident from this relation that ignifican t lead impedances can seriously limit the utility of a three
terminal cell unles the admittances from each of th e test electrodes to the guard electrode are kept
small compared to the direct admittance between th e test electrodes. The procedures described pre
viously for evalua ting the residual errors arc not en
tirely valid when the effective capacitance is calcu
lated by eq (4) rather than eq (3 ). In th e present measurements, however, where the admittances to
. the guard electrode were comparatively small, computations indicate that the u se of eq (3) should not
lead to an error in dielectric constant greater than 0.01 unit in any case. In fact, if any difficulty had
arisen from this simplification, it would have become evident at various stages during the course of
th e measurements, as, for example, in a discrepancy
in the calibrations for Oa+ Ob when the conductivity
and dielectric cells were used.

5. Results
The values of the dielectric constant of water
measured over the range 0.1° to 99° °fit the equation
where t is the temperature in degrees Oelsius. The


values computed from this equation are listed in table 2, together with the differ en ces b etween t h ese values and t hose actually m easured at each of the sp ecified temperatures. The maximum difference docs not exceed 0.01 unit. The last two column s
list the values of df /elt and th e temperature coefficien t
(l /f) (df/dt). It is int eresting to note that the temp erature coefficient is remarkably constant ov er the entire range. In fact, the al ternative relation
10g\Of = ] .943 15 - 0.0019720t , (6 )
fits the data n early as w ell as eq (5 ). In this case the maximum deviation is 0.02 and the average d eviation 0.01 unit in dielectric constant.
It is estimated that the over-all accmacy of the tabulated values of dielectric constant is ± 0.05 unit or b etter , and that the temp erature coefficient is determined to 1 p er cent or b etter at all temperatures.

6. Discussion
A comparison of the present data witlt those reported, over a wide range of temperature, by certain investigators in the last quarter century is shown in figure 7. The differ ences b etween the values of dielectric constant obtained in the earlier work and the present investigation are plotted as a function of the temperature. Smooth curves are shown wher e the data were fitted to empirical relations. With respect to the variation of dielectric constant with temperature, only the data of Wyman and Ingalls [5],
which were obtained in terms of l'Vyman's [1) value at 25° 0, are in satisfactory agreement with the present m easurem ents over an exten d ed in terval of temperature. Although their values are consistently higher, the temperature coefficient derived from the two sets of data agrees to better than 1 percent at all temperatures above 20° O.

Variou s reported values of the dielectric constant at 25° 0 are compared in table 3. The value of Lattey, Gatty, and Davies [10) resulted from a survey of the literature prior to ] 930. Although this value is closest to t hat obtained h er e, the agreement is not significant because of the wide scatter in the individual results (mea n deviation ± 0.4 u nit) . Th e r emaining values, each obtained by a differ ent experimental procedure and considered to h ave an accuracy of the order of 0.1 p er cent, are roughly 0.3 p er cent higher than that reported in this investigatio n. The close agreement between th ese earlier values at 25 ° C would appear to b e rather fortuitious in view of the sizable discrepancies exis ting at other temperatures, as shown by figure 7.

Althoug h t he work of Jones an d Davies [4] was of high precision a nd conducted with unusual care and atte llt ioll Lo possible sources of eJ'l'or , the method wa a com pa rat.ive olle in which benzene was employed as t he primary stan dard. Conseq uently, any error in the assumed value for t he dielectric constant of benzene \\ ould result in a percen tage error nearly twice as large in the value for water. Furthermore, direct compari sons of water and b enzene in t he sam e cell werr not feasible , so that adeli tional cells and liquids of intermediat e di electric constant were re
quired . 1'110 number of operations upon which the value fo r watcr was dep en dent was th er eby inereased and Lbe over-all uncertai nties of the method somewh at en itancecl. In view of th ese limi tation s t he difference beLween t hi s an d the present work does not appear to be excessively large. I n fact, if the data of Jones and Davies are corr ected for the value of benzene recently recommended [6], this difference is reduced to abou t 0.1 percent. The remaining values in table 3 were obtained by methods essentially absolu te in that no standard m edium other than air was needed. Beeause of the laek of experimental detail pertinent to the possible sources of error in the report of Albrigh t [3], no detailed comment on this work is possible. The ex
perimenLal methods of Wyman [1] and of Drake, Pierce, and Dow [2] were eomparatively direet and simple in principle. Although the experimenta.! precision was less than that obtainable with conventional bridge and resonance m ethods, this disadvantage was seemingly offset by the reduction or avoidance of troublesome residual elTors. In both cases the value reported at 25° C was the mean of a number of values obtained at various frequencies which had a spread of more than 0.3 p ercent.. The method of Wyman involves the determination of the resonant frequencies of fixed , m etallic resonators suspended in the medium. Seven resonators of several different design and of varying frequencies were employed. Exclu sive of the value obtained wiLh the resonator of lowest frequency, which was about 5 percent too high, the values of dielectrie constall t, when corrected to 25 ° , ranged from 78.42
to 78.70. It was assumed that these resonators behaved as idealized lump ed circ uits of inductance
L and capacitance C, so that the resonant frequency
j = 1/[27r (L C)1/2]. Then ~ =f6 W, where f o is the
resonant frequency in vacuum, and j is the correspon ding frequeney in the medium. The strict validity of this relation is questionable because of the effect of conductance of the medium on th e properties of resonant cir euits and the dependence of the induetance a nd resistan ce of metallic condu ctors upon frequeney through the "skin effect." A change in inductance due to the skin effect would lead to a high value for the dielectric constant. Although the magnitude of this error is difficult to evaluate without more speciflc details r egarding the eonstruction of the
7
resonators, estimates baserl upon simple U-loops, which simulate the form of inducLanee in some of the resonators , indicate thaL an errOl" of the order of several tenths of 1 percen L is plausible. From a study of the b ehavior of se \Teralresonators when the ionic conductivity of th e water was increased by the
addition of small amounts of K CI, Wyman showed
that the resulting error al 0 gave high values for the dieleetric constant, but concluded that the error was not significan t in th e case of pure water. However, estimates based upon the data presented, after making allowance for th e small but significant contribution to the conductiviLy arising from dielectric loss, indicate a remaining error of th e order of 0.1 percent in most instances. The procedure of Drake, Pierce, and Dow invol ved, in essence, the determination of the half wavelength of the standin g waves set up by a source of known frequency in a 4-m, ver tical, eoaxial pipe filled with water. Except for factors compu ted to be of negligible proportions, the dielectric co n
sta nt was given by e= c2/ (f2 Am2) , where f is the
frequency, Am th e wavelength in the medium, and c the velocity of ligh t. The preei ion obtained in determining the values of dielectric constant was governed primarily by the limi tations in measuring half wavelength and temperature, about 0.2 mm a nd 0.2 ° C, respectively, a nd varied from 0.3 to 0.15 p ercent, d epending upon th e frequency. Inasmuch as the presen ce of systematic errors of comparable m agnitude would hardly be d etecLed , the difference noted beLween t h eir value a nd the prese n t value i not unreasonable .
The magniLucle of Lh e disagreemen Lshown in figure 7 indicates tllaL, in general, Lhe accmaey of these data can hardly app roach 0.1 percent. This is not too su rpri ing as the reproducib ili ty obLained wa only ra rely betLer than 0.1 pereent. For the prese n t in vesLiga tion, t h e uncertainty due to any known source of err or seem s Lo be limiLecl to ± 0.01 unit. Summation, without regard to s ign , of Lhe individual uncerta in ties associaLed with the recognized sources of er1"or, leads to a possible uncer tain ty of ± 0.05 in the valu es of ~ or ± O.l per cent at the 'highest temperature. The over-all r eproducibili ty of separate determinations at any single temperature, ranging in number from 2 to 10, was such that the largest deviation from the mean for any given temperatul"C was 11e \' er worse than ± 0.015 unit, which occurred with both cells at 25° C (4 + 6= 10 observations) ; and the average of all 69 deviations from the ind ividual means for 21 temperatures was ± 0.005 unit. This agreement indicates the absen ce of signifi ca nt cumulative error and should provide a reasonable basis for an estimation of the accuracy attain ed. As a consequ ence, the assignment of an accuracy of ± 0.05 unit to all these data seem s entirely justified.
