Thermoresponsive polymers have received significant research attention as smart materials with particular interest in biomedical applications. The composition and architecture are known to strongly influence the thermoresponsive properties of the materials. For example, the strong overlap of end-grafted polymer chains in polymer brushes leads to a broader collapse transition relative to linear ungrafted chains as well as temperature dependent adhesion. The temperature response of free polymer has been widely reported to depend on the concentration and identity of ions in solution and is further modified by the composition of the solvent and presence of cosolutes. However, the influence of polymer architecture on these specific ion effects is relatively unknown. Herein, we compare the current understanding of specific ion effects on free polymer chains and gels with recent studies of polymer brushes. Further studies on mixed salt systems are found to be the next step to predicting the behaviour of these materials in biological systems. Ó 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1. Introduction
Responsive polymers that change their physicochemical properties when exposed to stimuli such as changes in pH [1,2], electric
field strength [3], temperature [4,5] and salt concentration and identity [6–8] have received significant research attention. These so-called smart materials are particularly promising for highvalue applications such as sensors, nanoactuation and microfluidics [9,10]. Field based stimuli such as temperature are attractive for these applications as they can repeatedly be triggered externally without affecting the composition of the system. Temperature responsive polymers have been investigated extensively for biomedical applications such as tissue engineering [5] and controlled drug delivery [5,11–15]. These polymers may be split into

two classes: those whose solubility decreases with increasing temperature display lower critical solution temperature (LCST) type behaviour, while those with upper critical solution temperature (UCST) type behaviour display the opposite trend [4,5]. LCST type polymers are far more common than UCST type in aqueous solutions [4,16,17]. Six primary categories of LCST-type thermoresponsive polymers were identified by Chen et al. [18] poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) (meth)acrylate]s [19–24], poly(2-alkyl-2-oxazo-line)s [23], poly (vinyl methyl ether)s [25,26], polypeptides [27,28], N-alkylsubstituted poly(aminoethyl methacrylate)s [29–32], and Nsubstituted poly(meth)acrylamides [33]. From this last category, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is by far the most studied neutral thermoresponsive polymer owing in part to its low sensitivity to environmental conditions (e.g. salt, pH, polymer concentration), its biologically relevant transition temperature (32 °C) and its structural similarity to proteins [34,35]. However, PNIPAM is cytotoxic under certain conditions [36], which has led to a number of alternative, biocompatible polymers receiving increasing interest [15,22,37]. Recent advances in monomer synthesis have facilitated a rapid expansion in the range of available monomers [4]. The LCST transition temperature may be tuned by varying the hydrophilicity of the monomer [18], or through copolymerisation of monomers with differing hydrophilicity [4,19]. For example, increasing the length of the hydrophilic ethylene glycol side chain length raises the LCST of oligo ethylene glycol methacrylates (OEGMAx), where x is the molar mass of the monomer [19]. Incorporation of additional components such as bioconjugates [38–41], ligands [42], fluorescent markers [43,44], or charged moieties [41,45–47] into copolymers can further modify the phase transition, add greater specificity for interactions between polymers and other solutes [39,45,46], or even facilitate new ways to study their behaviour [44]. Improved synthetic methods, such as reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) or atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) [20–22,24], have allowed access to a wide range of polymer geometries and architectures such as statistical, block and gradient copolymers, stars, dendrimers and gels (Fig. 1) [5,37]. Differing regions of hydrophilicity allows many of these molecules to self-assemble, which is particularly promising for controlled release applications [12]. Decorating surfaces with initiator sites and subsequent polymerisation directly from the surface allows the formation of polymer brushes [48]. This is known
as the grafting from approach which allows higher grafting densities than the sterically hindered adsorption of end-functionalised chains to the surface, i.e. the grafting to approach. Polymer brushes are assemblies of polymer chains end-grafted at a sufficiently high areal density to force self-interaction. The forced confinement of the chains, in addition to the chemistry of the polymer, allows tailoring of interfacial properties such as wettability, adhesion and lubricity [10]. These properties can be switched in responsive polymer brushes as the polymer conformation swells and contracts with changing solvent quality. In addition to the potential applications noted previously, surface-confined thermoresponsive polymer brushes have been utilised in applications ranging from chromatography supports [49–51] to the enzyme free removal of cells from tissue culture substrates [52–54]. Many factors affect the properties of thermoresponsive polymers in solution, including the polymer concentration [55,56], molecular weight (MW) [56–58], end-group chemistry [57–60], the presence of cosolutes such as salts and osmolytes [6,8,61], and the composition of the solvent [6,8]. Understanding the effect of added salt is important for many applications of these polymers as the background electrolyte concentration in the human body is around 100 mM [7]. It has been demonstrated extensively that the temperature response of ungrafted chains is affected by both the concentration and identity of ions in solution [6,8,61]. The tendency to either raise or lower the LCST of the polymer is often correlated with the degree to which a particular ion is excluded or accumulated at the polymer-solvent interface. However, this simplistic picture is inadequate in many cases [62,63]. Recent studies on thermoresponsive polymer brushes have shown that the influence of added ions cannot be solely explained by a shift in the LCST [64–68]. Herein, we seek to demonstrate the importance of architecture on the specific ion response of thermoresponsive polymers. Firstly, a brief overview of how composition and architecture affects the thermoresponse in salt-free water, with a focus on polymer brush coated surfaces provides context to observed salt-dependent behaviour. This is followed by a discussion of the current experimental and theoretical understanding of specific ion effects on thermoresponsive polymers with ungrafted and gel architectures. Comparison of these results with studies on brushes then allows the emerging picture of how the confined architecture of polymer brushes influences specific ion effects to be emphasised. Discussion of multi-responsive polymers containing pH and salt sensitive ionisable groups has been avoided as there is a strong, often non-monotonic [69], interplay between the degree of charge, the ionic strength and the temperature response [29,30,32,47,70–74]. Furthermore, reports of polymer brushes synthesised using the grafting from approach have already been discussed comprehensively by Klok and co-workers [75,76]. Below we demonstrate the need for systematic studies to elucidate the complex interplay of solution and polymer composition convolved with polymer architecture in determining the overall response to temperature.
2. Thermoresponsive polymers
2.1. The lower critical solution temperature of ungrafted chains
This article focusses on neutral polymers that have an LCST in aqueous solutions. In these systems, the LCST arises from the competition between enthalpic gain from hydration of hydrophilic moieties against the entropic penalty for the hydration of hydrophobic moieties via an ice-like, clathrate cage [33]. At temperatures above the LCST intra- and inter-molecular bonds dominate and the polymer collapses leading to an increase of the system entropy via the release of bound water molecules. It must

be noted that in most cases, critical solution temperatures (CSTs) at a single condition are reported, while the LCST corresponds to a minimum in a full phase diagram of CST as a function of polymer volume fraction, and occurs at what is defined as the critical concentration (/c) [35,77]. The term CST has been adopted throughout this article for all polymers exhibiting an LCST type transition. Three limiting behaviours for /c at infinite molar mass have been identified as outlined schematically in Fig. 2 [35,78]. Type I corresponds to classical Flory-Huggins mixing behaviour where /c approaches zero (e.g. poly(2-oxazoline) (POX) [79] or PNVCL [37]), Type II display a single non-zero value of /c (e.g. PNIPAM [35]) while Type III has one zero value of /c and two non-zero values (e.g.poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) [80]). Type II behaviour is predicted by Flory-Huggins theory if an empirical concentration dependent Flory interaction parameter, veff ðT; /Þ is introduced [35,81]. Note that there is no consensus on the value of veff ðT; /Þ even for the well-studied PNIPAM, and therefore must be treated with care when used for predictive purposes [82]. Type III behaviour is associated with strong solvent interactions that lead to the formation of molecular complexes [80]. A range of techniques allows various aspects of the phase transition to be interrogated. Cloud point measurements provide a simple estimation of the CST where a sharp transition is observed in most cases [77]. PNIPAM shows significant kinetically induced hysteresis between heating and cooling associated with strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3Aii), while the hysteresis for POEGMA copolymers with weaker intermolecular bonding is minimal (Fig. 3Ai) [34]. The degree of hysteresis is affected by the differing kinetics of hydrogen bond breaking and formation as revealed by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy [83,84]. Significant hysteresis is observed for PNIPAM for heating-cooling rates greater than 0.1 °C min1 [77,83]. Other spectroscopic techniques such as NMR [85], Raman [86,87] and FTIR [86–89] allow the hydration of individual moieties to be tracked as used by Wu and co-workers on POEGMA copolymers to highlight the tendency of polymers to rearrange to maximise contact between the solvent and hydrophilic moieties in the aggregated state [90]. Transition thermodynamics can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with the CST corresponding to an endothermic peak associated with breaking water-water hydrogen bonds in the clathrate cage [25,91]. Scattering techniques such as small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [92,93], small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) [92] and dynamic light scattering (DLS) [93,94] provide additional knowledge of the change in size and conformation of the chains through the transition. Further insights are accessible through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of oligomers [90,95].
2.2. Effect of polymer architecture on the temperature response
2.2.1. Block and statistical copolymers
Polymer architecture has a significant effect on both the locus of the thermal transition and the solution conformation of the polymer. For example, copolymers composed of blocks with different CST values undergo temperature dependent self-assembly due to the difference in hydrophilicity of each block [15,40,98–101]. In most cases statistical copolymerisation of monomers of varying hydrophilicity leads to a single intermediate, composition dependent, value of the CST [19,21,55,102]. However, distinct transitions can occur if the difference in CST of the monomers is large enough, leading to self-assembled structures similar to block copolymers [103,104]. Furthermore, block copolymers can have statistical copolymer-like behaviour with a single broadened transition observed if the CST of each block is similar [105]. The phase behaviour of copolymers may also be influenced by bonding interactions not present in the homopolymers. For example, intramolecular hydrogen bonding between poly(2-ethyl-2oxazoline) (PEtOx) and PNIPAM in PNIPAM-b-PEtOx-b-PNIPAM copolymers leads to a CST lower than that exhibited by either homopolymer [106].
2.2.2. Gels
Thermoresponsive gels are chemically or physically crosslinked polymer networks that undergo a volume phase transition (VPT) [107,108]. The VPT is heavily dependent on the limiting behaviour of the equivalent free polymer chains as they can be considered as high MW polymers with the maximum dilution restricted by the network [108]. This restriction causes gels of Type I polymers to undergo a continuous swollen-collapsed transition while Type II polymers separate into polymer rich and polymer dilute regions [78,108]. Higher degrees of cross-linking leads to a broadening of the transition as the network is further restricted (Fig. 3B) [96]. The enforced close confinement of polymer chains in this network amplifies composition dependent differences not apparent in the sharp CST of linear (co)polymer chains. For example, PNIPAM gels collapse over a significantly narrower temperature range than gels formed from homopolymer PMEO2MA or POEGMA-co-MEO2MA copolymers, Fig. 3C [97]. The same composition dependence on the breadth and magnitude of the temperature response is also evident, for example, when comparing the swelling of PNIPAM and PMEO2MA in the confines of polymer brushes (Fig. 3D) [64,67].
2.2.3. Polymer brushes on planar substrates
At a coarse level, the conformation of a neutral polymer brush is a balance of repulsive excluded volume interactions from overlapping chains that contribute to the swelling of the brush against the unfavourable loss of configurational entropy of swollen polymer chains [109]. The forced interaction of the grafted chains, as well as fluctuation of chain ends, leads to a broad continuous collapse of the brush with decreasing solvent quality (i.e. increasing temperature) instead of the first order transition of ungrafted polymers [110]. For example, a homopolymer POEGMA475 brush showed continuous conformational rearrangement from temperatures more than 50 °C below the CST of an equivalent ungrafted chain [111]. Note that a first-order transition is predicted for sufficiently high grafting density brushes in situations where there is a strong dependence of solvent quality on both concentration and temperature, as predicted for Type II polymers [35] and various theoretical models [108,112–115]. Here, vertical phase separation into a polymer rich region close to the substrate in equilibrium with a dilute tail is predicted at temperatures around the CST (Fig. 4A). Vertical phase separation has been observed directly in PNIPAM brushes by techniques sensitive to the average conformation perpendicular to the interface such as optical reflectometry (OR)

[116], spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) [117], and neutron reflectometry (NR) (Fig. 4B) [14,66,118]. While all three techniques reveal a polymer dense region followed by a dilute tail, NR is significantly more sensitive to the volume fraction of polymer [66]. Consistent with theory, vertical phase separation was more apparent at higher grafting densities and/or MW [116,118,119]. In particular, Varma et al. [116] and Yim et al. [118] studied a large combination of MW and grafting densities of brushes and only observed vertical phase separation at the highest grafting density in each case (0.3 and 0.21 nm2 respectively). In contrast, volume fraction profiles of homopolymer PMEO2MA [67] (Fig. 4C) and copolymer P(MEO2MA-co-OEGMA300) [65] brushes, which have weaker intermolecular interactions, display a continuous transition between the swollen and collapsed states. An important prediction of numerical self-consistent field (nSCF) calculations is that the interfacial properties of the dilute region at the periphery of the brush remain essentially unchanged until T >> CST where a single dense, collapsed phase is formed [120,121]. Therefore comparing techniques that are sensitive to the overall swelling of the brush such as surface plasmon resonance [122], ellipsometry [64], and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) [64,121] with techniques primarily sensitive to the surface of the brush, such as contact angle (CA), can provide indirect evidence of vertical phase separation. Often, a jump in CA to greater values is observed in the vicinity of the LCST and is interpreted as an increase in the hydrophobicity of the brush surface [54,64,122–131]. However, careful captive bubble CA measurements indicate that this is likely due to out-of-equilibrium measurements with the perceived
increase in hydrophobicity resulting from decreased droplet penetration into the brush [111]. In general, studies show that the bulk properties of the brushes vary over a wide temperature range around the CST, while the surface properties vary over a narrow temperature range above the CST. Simultaneous QCM-D and ellipsometry measurements have also been used to indirectly probe the conformation of PNIPAM and POX brushes by utilising the greater sensitivity of QCM-D to dilute chains at the periphery of the brush [79]. Here, Type II PNIPAM brushes showed a larger difference than Type I POX brushes in the observed coupled mass from each technique at temperatures below the CST. These observations are consistent with a bottom-up collapse with increasing temperature. Normal force measurements using atomic force microscopy (AFM) [66,67,132,133] and the surface forces apparatus (SFA) [123] are important for predicting performance in applications such as controlled cell adhesion [134] and lubrication [135]. These measurements are typically performed at a sufficiently slow interaction velocity to achieve quasi-equilibrium conditions. In a good solvent at sufficiently high grafting densities purely repulsive interactions are observed which are well approximated by the seminal theories of neutral polymer brushes [65,123]. At lower grafting densities attractive bridging interactions are also observed between the brush and the probe [66,67,136]. These bridging interactions occur if the chain ends have sufficient conformational freedom [137], with the minimum grafting density found to be lower for strongly interacting polymers [136]. The magnitude of the attraction increases and the interaction range decreases above the CST due to stronger polymer-polymer interactions and the sharper polymer-solution interface [66,138]. Little hysteresis is

observed between approach and retraction below the CST provided no polymer bridging is present. Adhesion is observed above the CST and is generally found to increase with increasing temperature [66,67,132,133,135,139].
However, measurements on P(MEO2MA-co-OEGMA) brushes by Kessel et al. that showed a decrease in adhesion between 1.2 nN and 0.4 nN over a period of 40 min likely due rearrangement of chains to expose hydrophilic moieties [140]. Rearrangement also explains the minimal change in equilibrium CA [111] and highlights that polymers contains hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains at all temperatures [141]. Polymer composition and the area of interaction have a significant impact on the magnitude of adhesion, as demonstrated by Synytska and co-workers for PNIPAM, P (OEGMA475-co-MEO2MA), and poly-(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate-co-oligo(propylene glycol) methacrylate) (P (OEGMA-co-OPGMA) brushes on smooth and rough substrates [132,133]. They also demonstrated that small radius tips penetrate the brush significantly while large radius probes primarily compress the brush with negligible penetration [133]. This high degree of tip penetration facilitates the use of single molecule force spectroscopy to determine the MW and grafting density of the polymer [142,143]. This is an important technique as it addresses issues in determining brush MW associated with the low polymer brush overall mass [144] and the non-equivalence of surface and bulk polymerisation [145,146]. Many applications of polymer brushes, such as the stabilisation of colloidal particles [147] and anti-fouling surfaces [148], occur in non-equilibrium states. We have recently demonstrated that the interaction between a silica colloid probe and a P(MEO2MA-coOEGMA300) brush was strongly dependent on the approach velocity (Fig. 5) [65]. Reduced contact time during approach led to a decrease in the formation of polymer bridges, while hindered drainage through the polymer network increased the magnitude of repulsion and attraction on approach and retraction respectively. Hydrodynamic drainage forces had significantly smaller impact on a highly swollen homopolymer POEGMA300 brush. The use of polymer brushes for lubrication is another key example of the importance of non-equilibrium effects in brush applications. For example, Yu et al. found that the coefficient of friction between a 6 lm gold colloid probe and a 170 nm PNIPAM brush was lowest at colder temperatures where the strong hydration of the brush resulted in minimal contact between brush and probe [135]. An approximately 100-fold increase in the coefficient of friction was observed at temperatures around the CST due to stretching of adhered chains. At high temperatures, the coefficient of friction reduces due to the stronger resistance to stretching of the chains, which in turn allows the probe to slide smoothly over the top of the brush. A similar increase in friction coefficient with increasing temperature was observed by An and co-workers for thermoresponsive poly(2-isopropyl-2-oxazoline) (PIPOZ) formed by electrostatically driven adsorption of a PIPOZ-cationic block copolymer [149–151]. The increased friction corresponded to higher interpenetration of brush layers in their lattice mean field theory [151]. Adsorption hysteresis during heating and cooling also highlights the complex interplay of solvent quality and amount of polymer forming the brush on the observed frictional response [150]. A greater understanding of non-equilibrium effects is therefore required for the design of thermoresponsive materials.
2.2.4. Polymer brushes on spherical substrates
The curvature of the grafting substrate can also influence the behaviour of a polymer brush [152]. As the distance from the core increases, the volume available per polymer chain expands since the chains effectively occupy a cone. When the volume available is beyond the radius of gyration of the polymer, the brush layer will transition from a concentrated brush regime to a semi-dilute brush regime [153]. Decreasing the core radius causes the transition to occur at a reduced distance as the effective chain volume increases more rapidly. Curvature may therefore be considered as a continuum from very small branched and star polymers where the core

is a macroinitiator [57,154–156], to polymer coated core shell particles with core radii on the order of nano- to micro-metres and finally to planar substrates. Similar to planar brushes, the temperature response is found to be broader than that of their ungrafted equivalents [157–162] and polymer density decreases normal to the substrate [163]. Increasing MW at constant grafting density and core radius shows particularly rich behaviour [160]. Similar to planar brushes, at low MW the transition is dominated by the cooperative collapse of confined chains near the substrate with the largest change in thickness occurring below the CST [157,158]. However, as the MW is increased the majority of the change in thickness occurs over a narrow temperature range above the CST akin to free polymer. Crucially, the degree of collapse below the theta temperature appears to be independent of MW (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material) [157,158,160].
3. Specific ion effects on thermoresponsive polymers
3.1. The origin of specific ion effects
The majority of physical models that include electrolyte effects are designed for low concentrations of electrolyte and assume that only their valency and concentration are important. However,
there is a growing body of evidence that phenomena that are independent of the composition of the electrolyte are the exception rather than the norm [7]. Specific ion effects were first identified in 1888 by Franz Hofmeister while investigating the stability of egg white proteins in various salt solutions (for an English translation please see reference [164]) and have since been observed to affect the stability of a wide range of colloids [165,166], swelling of polyelectrolyte brushes [143,167], solution properties such as osmotic pressure [168], and interfacial properties such as surface tension and partitioning of ions [169]. Early explanations of these effects were based on the assumption that ions can either enhance (kosmotropes) or break (chaotropes) the long-range structure of water. Subsequent studies have shown that ions have a minimal effect on water beyond their first hydration sheath [170]. Perhaps the strongest evidence against the importance of the long range structure of the solvent is that specific ion effects are not limited to water and have been observed in a range of pure and mixed solvents [171] Rather, specific ion effects arise from the interplay of all ion-ion, ion-solvent and solvent-solute interactions. Regardless, kosmo- and chaotropic remain useful labels for grouping ions that show similar properties as outlined in Fig. 6 [172]. The order of relative influence for each ion often aligns with the original Hofmeister series and/or the lyotropic series based on their lyotropic number [171]. It must be noted that there is significant variation within, or even complete inversion of [173], the observed order of ion influence depending on the nature of the system [174–176].
Significant experimental and theoretical progress has been made towards understanding the origin of specific ion effects in aqueous environments. Correlation of measurements with properties of the ions such as the surface tension increment, the JonesDole viscosity B coefficient, and the entropy of hydration facilitates development of empirical explanations [177–179]. Many studies point towards the importance of the relative ability of both the ions and the surface to dehydrate [7,180]. Indeed, there is convincing evidence that the strength of hydration and the corresponding number of strongly bound water molecules to ions varies significantly [168]. Collins’ law of matching water affinity is particularly successful for accounting for ion interaction with charged sites of proteins [180]. However it cannot account for experimental observations of the binding of ions to uncharged surfaces [181,182] or the accumulation of poorly hydrated ions and exclusion of strongly hydrated ions at hydrophobic interfaces [7,180]. Quantum mechanical (QM) theories incorporating dispersion forces, hydrated ion-size and polarisability of the solvated ion environment can account for many experimental observations of specific ion phenomena [169,180]. Indeed, the larger variations in polarisability of anions compared to cations leads to a correspondingly larger effect of ion identity for anions [7]. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations incorporating polarisable force fields also predict the accumulation of poorly hydrated chaotropic ions at hydrophobic interfaces [183]. There is a degree of similarity between chaotropic ions and ionic surfactants in both their surface activity and their tendency to reduce the surface tension of the airwater interface [184]. In fact, they can be considered as part of a continuum from chaotropic ions, to large hydrophobic ions such as those used in ionic liquids, to hydrotropes that can solubilise hydrophobic molecules to surfactants [184]. Discussion of the last two categories that exhibit self-assembled structures which are dependent on their hydrophilic-lipophilic balance is beyond the scope of this review.
3.2. Free polymer and self-assembled systems
3.2.1. Current understanding of the mechanism
Specific ion effects on the behaviour of neutral temperature responsive polymers have been reported for at least 60 years

[185]. In this time, the influence of salt on ungrafted polymer chains has been extensively investigated by both experiment and theory [6,8]. In most cases a linear decrease in the CST is observed with increasing concentration of kosmotropes, while for chaotropes a non-linear increase at low concentrations, shifting to a linear decrease at higher concentrations is observed. In the vast majority of studies, variations between cations are less significant than anion variations and therefore we will only report the anion identity unless the cation influence has been explicitly investigated. Significant progress in understanding the underlying cause of these effects has been made in the past two decades, with salting-in phenomena often associated with an accumulation of ions at or near the polymer-solvent interface while salting-out is related to the depletion/exclusion of ions from the interface. Perhaps the largest body of work investigating the underlying mechanisms of observed specific ion effects has been conducted by the groups of Cremer and Jungwirth. Their work has been reviewed extensively [6,61], so this article will focus on their primary conclusions. A key empirical approach utilised by the groups is the modelling of CST data as function of salt concentration by a combination of a linear term and a Langmuir type isotherm:
T 1⁄4 T0 þ c1⁄2M þ Bmax1⁄2M

where T is the CST observed at molar salt concentration [M] and T0 is the CST in the absence of salt. Bmax and c are constants with units of temperature (°C) and (°C M1) respectively. The constant c corresponds to the linear portion of the change, Bmax is the maximum change in CST due to ion binding and KD (M) is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant. Correlation of the fitted parameters
with ion properties identified three primary mechanisms that account for the specific ion effect observed for PNIPAM: [61,178,179] (1) Competition for hydration water by strongly hydrated anions can destabilise hydrogen bonds between polar groups and water, correlated with the entropy of hydration. (2) Accumulation of weakly hydrated anions and exclusion of strongly hydrated anions either decreases/increases the surface tension of the polymer-water interface leading to a linear increase/decrease of the CST, correlated with the surface tension increment. (3) Weakly hydrated anions can bind directly to the polymer leading to electrostatic stabilisation, correlated with polarisability. Similar analyses were applied to neutral temperature responsive elastin-like peptides [28] and polyethylene oxide-bpolypropylene oxide-b-polyethylene oxide (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblock copolymers (Pluronics) [186]. MD simulations demonstrate that ions do directly affect the macromolecule-solvent interfacial tension [187], while direct binding to polymers including PNIPAM by thiocyanate (SCN) has been subsequently confirmed by vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy [181], 1H NMR [188] and MD [189]. Thermodynamic two-state modelling recreates the phenomenological form of Eq. (1) and can relate the parameters back to simulation accessible preferential binding coefficients between the coil versus the globule [190]. Recent work has combined experiment, theory and simulation to show that strongly binding salts, such as guanidinium thiocyanate (GndSCN), can lower the CST at low-intermediate concentrations through cross-linking binding sites [63]. Re-entrant behaviour occurs at higher concentrations where binding sites are saturated. Polymer MW and concentration affect the magnitude of specific ion induced shifts of the CST [56,179]. A study of these variables

using PPO by Thormann and co-workers suggested that increasing MW weakens salt effects as the solvent accessible surface area of the collapsed globule scales with MW1/3 [56]. Higher concentration of polymer should also reduce this area as there is greater interaction between polymer chains. This weakens salting out effects while the reduced average centre-to-centre distance of the chains results in enhanced salting in effects due to a stronger electrostatic contribution. Studies by Zhang et al. on PNIPAM showed that the prevalence of two-step dehydration in the presence of strong kosmotropes was greater at higher MW and polymer concentrations [179]. Added salt had the strongest influence on the amide dehydration step and was attributed to stronger intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Apparent association constants of chaotropes were also found to increase at higher MW and polymer concentration for similar reasons. An important contribution by Thormann and co-workers is their investigation of the effect of mixtures of salts on the CST of, PPO as it provides a systematic step towards understanding the interplay of salts in biological systems where combinations of ions are common [191]. Here the effect of binary mixtures of Cl, Br, I and SCN on the CST and energetics of the transition were investigated using DSC (Fig. 7). Measurements in single salt solutions matched their earlier work [91] with Cl > Br showing a linear decrease, I having a minimal impact and SCN displaying a nonlinear increase in the CST. Addition of Cl, Br, and I resulted in a small, largely concentration independent shift on the enthalpy of the transition while SCN caused an almost linear decrease in its value with increasing concentration [191]. A reduction in the enthalpy corresponds to a weakening of the hydrophobic hydration of the polymer as breaking hydrogen bonds in the clathrate cage is the major contributor to the endothermic nature of the transition [91]. In the binary salt measurements, the concentration of either salt was held constant at 0.1 M then measured with increasing concentrations of the other salt up to 1 M [191]. In the case of mixtures of kosmotropic Cl and chaotropic SCN the CST shift is almost completely additive (Fig. 7B and E), while the enthalpy of the transition was close to the value of an equivalent concentration of SCN. The additivity of the effects supports the view that chaotropic and kos
motropic behaviour originates from the independent mechanisms described above, i.e. the accumulation of SCN does not affect exclusion effects of Cl. However, non-additive behaviour is observed for the two symmetric systems. Mixtures of Cl and Br were additive when the concentration of Cl was kept constant (Fig. 7A) and up to 0.6 M when the concentration of Br was kept constant (Fig. 7D). At higher concentrations of Cl, Br had a relative salting in effect. It is likely that at higher salt concentrations, competition for water molecules causes the relatively weakly hydrated Br to accumulate at the polymer interface. Indeed, the authors note that in 1 M solution roughly one third of all water molecules may be directly involved in ion hydration. Mixtures of SCN and I are dominated by the stronger adsorption of SCN that limits adsorption of I to the increasingly charged surface (Fig. 7C and F). This leads to an exclusion of I at higher solution concentrations and a relative salting out effect. Importantly, this study shows that the tendency to accumulate or exclude ions from an interface, and hence the kosmo- or chao-tropic character of a particular ion is not intrinsic. Rather, it depends on the overall composition of the electrolyte.
3.2.2. The role of polymer composition
Polymer composition significantly affects the magnitude of the specific ion response. For example, PPO was an ideal choice for the study of mixed salts described above due to its high sensitivity to added salt relative to PNIPAM [191]. A relatively large shift was also observed by Magnusson et al. for a series of copolymers of MEO2MA and OEGMA475 [192]. They attributed the greater salt sensitivity to the strong hydration of the ethylene glycol side chain. Varying the (co)polymer composition from 0 up to 20 mol% POEGMA475 did not appear to affect the magnitude of the shift of the CST. The same trend can be seen for MEO2MA and OEGMA500 (co)polymers in the same mol% range, while homopolymer POEGMA500 showed a steeper decrease in its CST [193]. Enhanced salt sensitivity has also been reported for the self-assembly of PEOPPO-PEO triblock copolymers [186,194,195] and for the CST of other PEG containing polymers [102,196,197]. Of interest is the observation that the second transition step associated with the dehydration of the more hydrophilic PEO block of Pluronic L44 that

occurs at higher temperatures shows no evidence of direct binding [186]. The authors propose that the CST appears to increase linearly through surface tension effects alone. The effect of composition on the magnitude of the salt response is strongly evident in the work of Cho et al. who compared the CST shift of elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) V5-120 (Fig. 8A) and ELP V5A2G3-120 (Fig. 8B) [28]. The relatively hydrophilic ELP V5A2G3120 was significantly more sensitive to added salt. They attribute this to greater partitioning at the hydrophilic surface leading to a more negative surface tension increment. An increased sensitivity to salt with increasing polymer hydrophilicity was particularly evident in the work of Bloksma et al. who studied a series of POX with systematically varied hydrophilicity [198]. Here, the relatively hydrophilic poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) was found to be the most salt sensitive. Interestingly, a comb polymer formed from oligo-2-ethyl-2-oxazoline side chains with a methacrylate backbone (POEtOxMA) exhibited a similar salt sensitivity to PEtOx despite having a CST 17 °C higher. Enhanced interaction between ions and hydrophilic surfaces was also proposed in studies of Pluronic L44 [186] and on the stability of lysozyme [173] due to the higher dielectric environment. However, one cannot ignore other contributing factors such as changes in the solvent accessible surface area and specific binding sites [6,56,182]. While the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, it is evident that composition plays an important role on the magnitude of the specific ion response.
3.2.3. The influence of solvent composition and the presence of cosolutes
Further mechanistic insight into specific ion effects is possible through the addition of cosolutes and changing solvent composition as shown by Liu et al. [8] In the absence of salt, macromolecular crowding agents such as polyethylene glycol (PEG, i.e. low MW PEO) lower the CST of ungrafted thermoresponsive polymers due to excluded volume effects and competition for water molecules [199]. In principle, one would also expect an amplification of specific ion effects as the activity and local concentration of the ions is increased. However, this ignores the potential for crowding agents to interact directly with both the polymers and the ions in solution. For example, direct interactions between dextran and SCN detected by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) reduce the salting in effect while dextran-PNIPAM hydrogen bonding weakens the salting out effect of chloride and acetate (CH3COO). PEG does not interact with ions and was found to enhance specific ion interactions. Sakota el al. performed a similar study with PEG that used fluorescence measurements to show that crowding agents rendered the solutions relatively hydrophobic [200]. This could in fact reduce the degree of binding because more hydrophobic environments stabilise chaotropes. However stronger electrostatic interactions due to the low dielectric constant of the solution led to an overall increase in the salting in effect at low concentrations. The presence of 18-C-6 crown ether was recently found to enhance the salting out of PNIPAM by kosmotropic anions and diminishing salting in by chaotropic anions [201]. Smaller cosolutes such as osmolytes do not exhibit significant excluded volume effects but can involve a significant proportion of water molecules in hydration and can also interact directly with ions and solutes. For example, in the absence of salt the ability of urea to form hydrogen bonds with ungrafted PNIPAM lowers the CST, while methylated urea variants that are incapable of forming hydrogen bonds raise the CST due to hydrophobic interactions [61]. Note a combination of ellipsometry measurements of a PNIPAM brush and MD simulations show concentration dependent PNIPAM-urea interactions. At urea concentrations below 0.5 M preferential exclusion of urea dominates, while PNIPAM-urea binding and cross-linking effects determine the behaviour at high concentration [202]. No increase in anion specificity is observed for osmolytes that are excluded from the PNIPAM surface such as urea and glucose for concentrations at least as high as 2 M [203]. However, the exposed carbonyl group of PNIPAM-(tri)methylated urea complexes formed from hydrophobic interactions enhances ion specificity by increasing the importance of the relative ability of ions to destabilise hydrogen bonding between water and the complex [203]. The sensitivity of thermoresponsive polymers to added osmolytes is also composition dependent [18]. For example, the differing sensitivity of PNIPAM and poly(N-acryloylsarcosine methyl ester) to urea and phenol allowed the difference between the collapse temperature of each block to be increased and decreased in urea and phenol solutions respectively [18]. The large effect of composition on the susceptibility of polymers to specific ion effects suggests addition of salt ions would be an ideal handle for modulating the phase behaviour of block copolymers. An interesting example of this are the previously discussed PNIPAM-b-PEtOx-b-PNIPAM triblock copolymers [106] where perchlorate is known to weakly lower the CST of PNIPAM [61] and strongly raise the CST [198] of PEtOx. Copolymers with the shortest PNIPAM blocks behaved like homopolymer PEtOx [106]. However, dehydration of PEtOx due to intramolecular bonding with longer PNIPAM blocks completely screened the specific ion effect of the PEtOx block. The composition of the solvent also has a strong influence on ion specificity. This often arises from the formation of watercosolvent complexes that are poorer solvents than either pure sol

vent. Liu et al. studied the influence of salt on the CST of PNIPAM in a wide range of alcohol-water mixtures and found that anion specificity increased with the stability of the solvent complexes [204]. Anion specificity did not correlate directly with the hydration number of the alcohol complexes and therefore an increase in the effective concentration of anions cannot account for the increased specificity. Rather, anions are thought to influence the stability of complexes which becomes more significant with increasing alcohol composition and with stronger complexes. A similar mechanism differentiates ethylene glycol (EG)-water and peroxide-mixtures where only EG enhances anion specificity due to stronger hydrogen bonding interaction with water [205]. Specific cation effects, although weaker, are more likely to arise from ion mediated polymer-solvent interactions. Water-nonaqueous solvent mixtures can also lead to UCST behaviour [16,58,206]. The UCST of PNIPAM in ethanol-water mixtures follows a similar trend to the LCST while DMSO exhibits a V-shaped series due to the competing effects of anion binding to the polymer and anionpolarisation of DMSO [207]. An understanding of all these effects is necessary for predicting performance in biological systems. Solvent dependency is even apparent in the isotopic substitution of H2O for D2O due to the stronger hydrogen bonding of D2O. Stronger hydrogen bonding leads to an increase of both the enthalpic gain and entropic cost of hydration, with the latter effect usually dominating leading to a lowering of the CST [208]. Ion hydration is also affected, leading to a greater difference in the strength of hydration between chaotropes and kosmotropes. Thormann and co-workers compared the effect of SCN, Cl and F on the CST of polypropylene oxide (PPO) in H2O and D2O using DSC [208]. In the presence of D2O salting in by SCN was strengthened by 10% and salting out weakened by 5% in Cl solutions, which was attributed to weaker hydration and therefore higher affinity for the polymer. No change was observed in the presence of F where the salting out effect of an increased degree of hydration is likely balanced by a reduced solvent accessible surface area in D2O. These studies demonstrate that there is a complex interplay between polymer, ions and other components of the surrounding solution. However, careful choice of solvent and cosolute may be used to tune the specific ion response or even provide greater insight into its mechanism of action.
3.2.4. Specific ion dependent aggregation
Recent studies have highlighted the role of specific ion effects in the aggregation of thermoresponsive polymers. These phenomena were investigated by Abetz and co-workers in studies of homopolymer poly[2-(N-morpholino)ethyl methacrylate] (PMEMA) [94] and copolymer PS-b-PMEMA [209] using DLS. In salt-free water the homopolymer underwent a three stepaggregation process with increasing temperature corresponding to mesoglobule formation, stabilised aggregates and macroscopic precipitation respectively [94]. Importantly, these separate steps would not be observed by more common cloud point measurements. Variation of both polymer MW and concentration and measurements in both H2O and D2O indicate that the second step corresponds to the breaking of hydrophobic bonds to form aggregates stabilised by hydrogen bonds between water and the heterocycle. Salting out behaviour is observed for kosmotropic sodium salts with Cl < F < SO42 while salting in is observed for chaotropes with SCN > I > Br. The first aggregation step is absent in kosmotropes suggesting that they destabilise mesoglobules. Chaotropes have a relatively strong influence on this initial step which may arise from the large difference in accessible surface area between an expanded coil and a mesoglobule. The PS-b-PMEMA copolymer featured a high MW (100 kDa) and low dispersity (<1.1) compared to similar block copolymers in the literature [209]. This led to a range of well-defined self-assembled
structures in the bulk. Micelles display a two-step aggregation process corresponding to the second and third steps of the homopolymer transition. As with the homopolymer, NaBr showed a salting in effect for both steps. Surprisingly, NaCl showed a linear salting out effect for the first step that switched to salting in for the second aggregation process. The authors suggest that the reduced surface area of the aggregate may increase the number of available dehydrated chloride anions available for adsorption. However, an alternate hypothesis is that the higher density of hydrophilic heterocycles at the surface of the aggregate could lead to stronger binding and/or a more negative surface tension increment, and hence a switch to salting in behaviour [28,173,182]. Complex specific ion effects on the structure of aggregates above the CST were also observed by You and co-workers for PVME [26], PPO [26], PNIPAM [26,210] and poly(tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PMEO3MA) [182]. Each system was studied by density functional theory to calculate and identify the dipoles of each monomer unit. ITC showed appreciable binding of SCN to each polymer with 1H NMR measurements showing direct binding at positive dipoles (Fig. 9A and B). In contrast, Na+ and SO42 did not show appreciable binding to any region of the polymers, likely due to their greater hydration. These results were further supported by a reduction of the zeta potential with increasing SCN concentration, while the zeta potential was largely independent of SO42 concentration. Of particular note was the direct evidence of SCN binding to the OEG side chain of MEO3MA for two reasons [182]. Firstly, it is often reported that anions show no appreciable interaction with PEG while cations do [211]. Prior to this study only indirect evidence of chaotropic anion accumulation on PEG was reported through diffusiophoresis measurements [212]. Secondly, ITC measurements show that while the equilibrium binding constant of PNIPAM and PMEO3MA are similar, the number of binding sites per monomer is much greater for PMEO3MA (0.584 vs 0.09) (Fig. 9C) [182]. This further highlights that the number of accessible binding sites has a significant effect on the salt sensitivity. Aggregates were formed by heating each polymer above its CST in NaSCN solutions of varying concentrations as outlined schematically in Fig. 9D. TEM and SEM measurements showed a wide range of aggregates including nanoparticles, micelles, nanorods, nanovesicles and compound micelles depending on the salt concentration and the polymer (Fig. 9E and F) [26,182]. This variation was attributed to different ratios of ion-bound and non-ion-bound domains above the CST. Indeed, ITC measurements above the CST showed that the degree of binding was largely unaffected as the anion-dipole bonds (20–200 kJ mol1) are stronger than hydrogen bonds (5–60 kJ mol1). Zeta potential measurements also showed that the degree of anion binding reduced with increasing temperature [210]. Therefore the temperature above the LCST can be used as an additional handle for tuning the structure of PNIPAM aggregates. This body of work demonstrates that the presence of dipoles in most neutral thermoresponsive homopolymers can drive selfassembly akin to block copolymers simply by adding chaotropic salts and heating above the LCST. The relationship between ions and aggregates is complex with the previous example by Abetz and co-workers [209] showing that the structure of aggregates can dictate the specific ion response.
3.3. Gels
3.3.1. Effect on the volume phase transition
Systematic studies of specific ion effects on thermoresponsive gels are less common than for free polymers. These studies often have a greater focus of the influence of ions on the mechanical properties of the gels [213–217]. An early example is the work of Innomata et al. who compared specific ion effects of cross-linked

PNIPAM gels with their linear equivalents [218]. The shift of the CST of the linear chains was similar in magnitude to the shift in the VPT temperature of the gel. Temperature shifts in inorganic salts correlated well with the viscosity B-coefficient of the anion, while the magnitude of the shifts in Na+ and K+ were identical. A non-monotonic relationship between the tendency to raise or lower the CST and the alkyl chain length of a series of tetraalkylammonium bromide salts was observed. This highlights the complex nature of hydrophobic ions. Annaka et al. demonstrated using low frequency Raman scattering on PNIPAM gels that the addition of kosmotropic salts is indistinguishable from changing the temperature of pure water as the change in chemical potential at the VPT temperature is identical in all cases [219]. The effect of salt on the phase transition of PNIPAM hydrogels was investigated by Rice and co-workers using 1H NMR spectroscopy [220–222]. Thermodynamic quantities were extracted using van’t Hoff analysis which identified two stages in
the phase transition. The first stage was attributed to changes in intramolecular hydrophobic bonds while the second is associated with the dehydration of the polymer side chains. Interestingly the inorganic salts all affected the first stage, with the second stage only being affected by 400 mM fluoride. Hysteresis upon cooling is kinetically limited by hindered diffusion through the collapsed network and re-swelling only occurs at temperatures low enough for hydration of the hydrophobic regions of the polymer to dominate intramolecular bonding. This leads to the hysteresis being increased in kosmotropic F and decreased in chaotropic I solutions. In the majority of the cases, the addition of salt can be approximated by a lateral shift of the entire swelling curve along the temperature axis (Fig. 10A). However, addition of sodium iodide changes the shape of the swelling curve as well (Fig. 10B). Notably, the salting-in relative to water in 200 mM I is much more apparent at lower normalised peak heights corresponding to a lower degree of swelling. This is even observed at 300 and 400 mM I where there is an otherwise net salting-out effect. We believe that this is a result of the smaller distance between neighbouring bound iodide ions as the gel collapses leading to stronger electrostatic repulsion that hinders further collapse. This demonstrates that the confined nature of gels changes the specific ion response beyond a simple change in the CST.
3.3.2. Influence of ions on mechanical properties
The mechanical properties of gels are important for applications such as biological scaffolds and soft robototics [223]. Specific ion effects are apparent in the formation and mechanical properties of thermogelling polymers, i.e. materials with a temperature dependent sol–gel transition [213–217]. In general, these studies show a decrease of the both the critical gelation temperature and the breakdown temperature, where the gel phase separates, in kos

motropic salts. The opposite is true of strongly chaotropic inorganic salts [213,214,217] and hydrophobic organic salts [217]. Interestingly, rheological measurements indicate that the strength of the hydrogel is increased in kosmotropes where it is associated with stronger polymer-polymer interactions [213,215,217] as well as an increase in the density of physical contact points within the network [217]. Conversely chaotropes tend to reduce the strength of the gel [217]. Jaspers et al. showed that the change in stiffness of ethylene glycol-functionalised polyisocyanides in kosmotropes and chaotropes is accompanied by a commensurate decrease or increase in sensitivity to applied strain [216]. They highlight that addition of salt allows tuning of the mechanics of hydrogels without changing the porosity of the network. This is important as porosity is dependent on other parameters that affect the mechanics such as polymer concentration and cross-linking density.
3.4. Polymer brushes
3.4.1. The influence of ionic strength
Similar to gels, studies of specific ion effects on thermoresponsive polymer brushes are scarce compared to studies of ungrafted polymers. Thermoresponsive brushes have been measured in physiological buffer solutions which cause a general salting out effect, i.e. the brush is more collapsed at a given temperature relative to water [224,225]. However, these studies do not systematically vary the concentration or nature of the ion which limits insights into the overarching impact of ion identity. Limited earlier studies investigated concentration effects of chloride [159,226] and sulfate [159,227]. Increasing concentrations of salt resulted in a reduction in the swelling at constant temperature [159,227] or shift of the transition temperature to lower temperatures [226]. Intriguing salt induced collapse kinetics were observed using AFM imaging and QCM-D by Ishida et al. whereby equilibration at the minimum salt concentration to induce collapse of the brush was slower (30 min) than at higher and lower concentrations (<3 min) [227]. This reflects the delicate balance between the swollen and collapsed states at the transition condition. The influence of the ionic strength of a wide range of cation-anion pairs on the wettability of a PNIPAM grafted polyethylene was investigated by Bergbreiter and co-workers [228,229]. Incorporation of silica nanoparticles into the brush formed a hierarchical structure that enhanced changes in CA. The concentration required to collapse the brush reduced with increasing kosmotropic character of the anion for a series of sodium salts [228]. No significant collapse was observed in NaI and NaSCN up to 3 M. No clear trend for the effect of cation identity was observed for a series of sulfate salts when plotted as a function of concentration [229]. Additional insight into specific ion effects requires systematic variation of both the temperature, and the concentration and nature of the ion.
3.4.2. Mechanistic understanding of the transition
Fundamental studies on the effect of a series of sodium halides on the thermodynamics of the collapse transition of a PNIPAM brush were performed by Naini et al. using a novel laser temperature-jump technique [230,231]. Stroboscopic measurements allowed the intrinsic switching kinetics of the brush in salt free water and in 250 mM Cl, Br and I to be measured as a function of temperature [231]. The degree of salting out by the ions followed the Hofmeister series with I < Br < Cl. In all cases the characteristic switching time was on the order of milliseconds which highlights the potential use of thermoresponsive brushes as nano-actuators and sensors. A two-state model allowed the change in enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy of the transition to be extracted. Note that a change in slope in the van’t Hoff plot is observed at the transition temperature which may be evidence of two separate collapse processes [220–222]; ungrafted chains do
not display a change in slope in similar analyses [232]. An important conclusion of their analysis is that the change in enthalpy and entropy across the swollen to collapsed transition or the PNIPAM brush is unaffected by the addition of salt [231]. The authors claim this as evidence of direct coupling of the sodium halides to the polymer chain and its hydration shell. However, an equally valid interpretation is that it results from the total exclusion of well hydrated ions from the polymer surface as invoked for DSC measurements on PPO [91]. As discussed earlier, sodium halides did not affect the enthalpy of the CST transition of PPO chains, while this parameter was reduced in SCN, consistent with a weakening of the hydrophobic hydration. There is significant scope for investigating the effect of a wide range of salt identities and concentrations and polymer compositions using this technique. Simulations of specific ion effects on thermoresponsive polymer brushes [233], and responsive brushes in general [234–236], are limited. This is due in part to the large number of molecules required to adequately define a brush in an aqueous electrolyte leading to a high computational cost as well as difficulties in choosing an appropriate force field [187]. However, appropriate simplifying assumptions allow valuable qualitative insight [67,236]. For example, the molecular theory of Zhao et al. was used to investigate the interaction of a series of sodium halides with a PNIPAM brush by only considering PNIPAM-water, water-anion and PNIPAM-anion bonds [233]. Their work showed that the degree of swelling at a given temperature followed the Hofmeister series with I > Br > Cl. Within the model framework, the specific anion effects arose from the degree of replacement of waterPNIPAM bonds with anion-PNIPAM bonds leading to a more hydrophobic surface. However, the role of the cation was not considered. Continued development of simulations is required to provide molecular level insight to observations from systematic experiments.
3.4.3. Systematic studies of the interplay of temperature, polymer composition, ion concentration and identity
The previous discussion has identified the need for systematic experimental variation to gain a deeper insight into specific ion effects in thermoresponsive polymer brushes. Salt induced collapse in kosmotropic SO42 and enhanced swelling in chaotropic ClO4 at constant temperature was observed by Hackett et al. for POEGMA brushes grafted from conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thio phene) (PEDOT) layers [193]. Electrochemical measurements in 0.1 M show that the temperature at which the brush collapses increases in accordance with the Hofmeister series with SO42 < Cl < ClO4. The electrochemical behaviour of the grafted PEDOT was sensitive to both the temperature and added salt, showing increased electroactivity in 0.1 M ClO4. We have systematically investigated the effect of added salt and temperature on the swelling of planar PNIPAM brushes using ellipsometry, QCM-D, CA, colloid probe AFM and NR [64,66]. In these studies the CH3COO and SCN were chosen as representative kosmotropic and chaotropic anions from opposite ends of the Hofmeister series [7,171]. The high temperature resolution afforded by ellipsometry and QCM-D indicated that the addition of increasing CH3COO concentration primarily results in a lateral shift of the collapsed-swollen transition to lower temperatures [64]. This is supported by the similarity of the volume fraction profiles in D2O (Fig. 4B) and in CH3COO determined by NR (Fig. 11A and C) [66]. In contrast, ellipsometry of a PNIPAM brush in SCN showed an increase in the thickness of both the fully swollen and collapsed states, in addition to a lateral shift of the transition to higher temperatures [64]. Comparison to QCM-D measurements led to the hypothesis that the periphery of the brush was extended due to electrostatic repulsion from bound SCN. Subsequent NR measurements directly showed that SCN influences the internal

structure of PNIPAM brushes (Fig. 11B and D) [66]. Here a broadening of the transition was observed with increasing SCN concentration. This effect was greater at higher temperatures where the brush is collapsed leading to stronger electrostatic interaction of bound SCN. A stronger influence of chaotropic anions at higher temperatures has also been observed for cross-linked PNIPAM films [237] and the previously discussed gel systems [220]. Similar to studies of gels [220], we demonstrated that addition of strongly hydrated CH3COO results in a higher resistance to compression than in SCN solutions or salt free water for a given degree of swelling using a combination of NR and AFM measurements [66]. Our research group has subsequently investigated the temperature response of PNIPAM brush modified 120 nm silica particles in eleven different monovalent salt solutions between 50 and 1000 mM [147]. Unlike salt free experiments, particle aggregation occurred as the brush collapsed in all salt conditions investigated, as the Debye length was smaller than the brush thickness and the underlying surface charge was screened. The reduction in the range of electrostatic repulsion enabled inter-particle polymerpolymer interactions leading to the formation of particle aggregates. Unlike planar PNIPAM brushes [64,66], the shape of the brush transition was unaffected by the presence of the salt as highlighted by the presence of a master curve for all conditions [147]. Fig. 12A displays the CST of the PNIPAM brush modified particle dispersions, defined as the temperature at the midpoint of the collapse transition, for the series of potassium salts while Fig. 12B displays the CST for the chloride salts. The results for the anion series are similar to previous studies on free PNIPAM [61] while the cation series show an increase in the variation between salts compared to previous free polymer studies [238].
We have also investigated the influence of composition on the specific ion response of thermoresponsive OEGMA based (co)polymer brushes with different average ethylene glycol (EG) side chain lengths, n, utilising similar techniques (Fig. 13) [65,67]. As found for ungrafted polymers [19] and earlier brush studies [121,239], increasing n led to a higher CST or degree of swelling at a given temperature [65,67]. Initial work on homopolymer PMEO2MA (n = 2, CSTungrafted 28 °C) [67] brushes showed enhanced specific ion effects relative to PNIPAM brushes of comparable thickness and grafting density (Fig. 13B) [67]. This was particularly evident for SCN solutions where the lateral shift in temperature at 250 mM was five times greater. Follow up work on a statistical copolymer P(MEO2MA-stat-OEGMA300) (n = 3 °C, CSTungrafted  45 °C, Fig. 13Ci) and homopolymer POEGMA300 (n = 4.5 °C, CSTungrafted 65 °C, Fig. 13Cii) brushes showed similar trends, with the response to SCN further enhanced for the homopolymer POEGMA300 brush. This likely arises from a greater number of binding sites per monomer due to the EG side chains [182]. Again, the influence of SCN was greater for the collapsed brush owing to stronger electrostatic interactions due to charges in proximity and the lower dielectric environment. Contrary to the behaviour of ungrafted polymer [193], the influence of CH3COO on the homopolymer POEGMA300 brush was minimal which we attributed to exclusion of the strongly hydrated anions from the interior of the brush [65]. Confirmation of this would require a depthsensitive spectroscopic technique such as ATR FTIR. In general, added electrolyte had a relatively small influence on colloid probe AFM measurements with differences often reflecting the change in swelling state of the brush [65,67]. For example, the stronger swelling of the brushes in SCN reduced bridging interac

tions with predominantly repulsive interactions being evident upon approach at low temperatures, while the relatively collapsed structures in CH3COO led to a reduced range of compression. However, a comparison of the range of compression of the P(MEO2MA-stat-OEGMA300) with the degree of swelling determined by ellipsometry showed that the stiffness of the brushes increased with added SCN, likely due to a greater degree of electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, an increasing magnitude of adhesion with added SCN was observed for the POEGMA300 brush despite being highly swollen in all conditions. Together with studies on PNIPAM [66,68], these results show that the addition of salt affects the mechanical properties of the brush as is important for applications such as antifouling or lubrication in a non-trivial way. To date, investigations on the effect of mixed electrolytes on thermoresponsive polymers has been minimal despite the complex composition of electrolytes within the human body [191]. We have
recently conducted preliminary investigations on the effect of mixed electrolyte systems on the swelling behaviour of a 28.8 nm PMEO2MA brush using spectroscopic ellipsometry (experimental details in Supplementary materials). Mixed salt titrations were performed at constant temperature (10, 20 or 30 °C) and ionic strength (250 mM) with the mole fraction of SCN and CH3COO varied. The fitted ellipsometric brush thickness as a function of mole fraction of SCN in the electrolyte mix is provided in Fig. 14. Here, the dotted lines correspond to the fitted thickness in water immediately prior to each titration. Consistent with data presented above [65,67], it can be seen that for each temperature the increase in thickness relative to water for 250 mM SCN (i.e. 1 mol fraction SCN) is larger than the decrease in thickness relative to water for 250 mM CH3COO (i.e. 0 mol fraction SCN) solutions. Changing electrolyte composition at constant temperature leads to a close to linear change in brush thickness. Note at 30 °C the brush is fully collapsed at SCN mole fractions of 0 and 0.25 SCN. The salting in behaviour of SCN is a saturation binding phenomenon, leading to a non-linear increase with increasing concentration, while the salting out by CH3COO is directly proportional to concentration [6]. Therefore the linear change in thickness with composition tentatively suggests that salting in and salting out behaviour may not be completely additive for thermoresponsive brushes. These intriguing data have led us to undertake a broad systematic study utilising ellipsometry, QCM-D, and NR experiments to gain insight into the underlying the behaviour of brushes in mixed salt systems. This is a step towards the investigation of more complex systems.
3.4.4. Direct comparison of polymer in solution and at the solid-liquid interface
Recently, Moghaddam and Thormann compared the influence of the sodium salts of F, tricholoroacetate (TCA) and SCN on PNIPAM in bulk solution and adsorbed at the gold-aqueous interface [68]. As found in their studies on PPO [91], 200 mM SCN reduced the change in entropy and enthalpy of the phase transition in bulk solution while 200 mM F had the opposite effect [68]. These changes corresponded to an increase of 1.25 °C and decrease 4.5 °C in the CST of respectively. TCA had minimal impact on the transition thermodynamics and caused a decrease of the CST of 1.2 °C despite its poor hydration and strong affinity for hydrophobic interfaces [240]. In contrast, QCM-D measurements of PNIPAM adsorbed on gold suggest that the degree of polymer swelling is higher in SCN and TCA at 200 mM than in water, with F showing the opposite behaviour (Fig. 15) [68]. These trends were also apparent for symmetric normal-force interactions between thiolterminated PNIPAM layers measured using colloid probe AFM. At 20 °C, 200 mM fluoride showed attractive bridging on approach while the other two salts exhibited repulsive interactions consistent with compression of highly swollen polymers (Fig. 16). At 40 °C, all salts displayed bridging interactions accompanied by a reduction in the range of compression and an increase in adhesion during retraction. Interestingly, a small but reproducible repulsive interaction was observed prior to the formation of bridging in SCN and TCA which may be electrostatic in origin due to the accumulation of anions in the adsorbed layer. Results discussed above show that the influence of trichloroacetate on PNIPAM switches from salting out in bulk solution to salting in at the gold-aqueous interface. The most likely explanation is a competition between salting out due to cross-linking by the strongly binding ion [63] and salting in effects due to electrostatic repulsion. Electrostatic interactions are expected to be stronger within the adsorbed polymer layer where the average chain-chain distance is smaller [56]. Cross-linking may also explain the smaller dissipation shift relative to SCN measured by QCM-D, indicative of a stiffer brush. We speculate that this could also account for the

reduced change in frequency between the swollen and collapsed states due to restricted conformational change as seen for chemically cross-linked microgels [96]. NR measurements sensitive to the brush conformation could confirm this hypothesis. Regardless, this work highlights that the relationship between specific ion effects in the bulk and at the solid-liquid interface is non-trivial.
4. Conclusions
Thermoresponsive polymers are promising building blocks for smart materials [5,11–15]. There is particular interest in polymers
that exhibit a CST between room and body temperature for biomedical applications such as enzyme free removal of cells from cell-culture substrates [52–54]. The temperature response in salt free water is strongly affected by both the composition of the polymer(s) and the polymer architecture. For example, increasing confinement of the polymer chains leads to a broadening of the swollen-collapsed transition in polymer brushes [64,67,111,121] and gels compared to the sharp transition of free polymer chains [34]. Non-equilibrium effects such as the rearrangement of chains to maximise contact of hydrophilic moieties with the solvent [90] or the hydrodynamic drainage through the brush [65,135] should also be taken into account when designing materials. In addition to polymer composition and architecture, the temperature response is strongly affected by environmental conditions. There has been significant research attention devoted to understanding the influence of salt concentration and identity on free polymer [6,8,61]. These studies broadly show that addition of weakly hydrated, chaotropic ions accumulate at the polymer surface, leading to a non-linear increase in the CST. Strongly hydrated, kosmotropic ions are excluded from the surface and show a linear decrease in the CST. This broad picture is complicated in the case of strongly binding electrolytes, such as GndSCN, where crosslinking effects at low concentrations lead to polymer collapse while re-entrant behaviour is observed at high concentrations [63]. Polymer chemistry was found to have a large impact on the magnitude of the specific ion response, with hydrophilic polymers tending to be more sensitive to added salt. A complete description of the specific ion response requires an understanding of the interplay between ions, the solvent, the polymer and even cosolutes such as crowding agents and osmolytes [6,8,61]. Studies of specific ion effects on other polymer architectures such as gels and brushes are relatively scarce compared to those regarding free polymer chains. The general behaviour of these

materials correlates well with understanding from linear chains with chaotropes leading to relatively swollen structures and kosmotropes leading to relatively collapsed structures at a given temperature [64–67,147,220]. However, there can be significant deviations in behaviour due to the confinement of the chains. In particular, we find that the influence of chaotropes is stronger at higher degrees of collapse due to the reduced average distance between binding sites leading to stronger electrostatic repulsion [220]. This parallels the effects of increasing free polymer concentration [56]. It is also found that there is a strong influence of ion identity on the mechanical properties of brushes [65–67] and gels [213–217]. Finally, the behaviour of trichloroacetate was found to switch from salting out for free polymer to salting in at the solidliquid interface [68]. The studies described above show a complex interplay between polymer chemistry, solvent composition and polymer architecture on the temperature response. However, in the majority of the studies of specific ion effects described above, only a single electrolyte was investigated at a time. Recent work has systematically investigated the effect of binary mixed electrolytes [191]. Here, chaotropic and kosmotropic behaviour was found to be largely independent. However, competition for hydration or binding can
lead to a reversal of the behaviour of individual ions. An understanding of all these parameters is crucial for informed design of smart materials for biomedical applications due to the complex make-up of biological media.
