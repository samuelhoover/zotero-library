Introduction
Hydrogel has the special property that it changes its volume in response to a change in the surroundings. Particularly, the study of the swelling behavior of hydrogels in aqueous salt solutions is important in terms of biomedical applications. The signi®cant swelling of the charged gel in water was explained by Flory and Rehner [1] over 50 years ago with a theory taking account of osmotic pressure caused by the mobile counterions in the gel. Ricka and Tanaka [2] explained without free parameters the dependence of the swelling of acrylamide±acrylic acid copolymer on the ionic composition of the solvent by using the Donnan theory. On the other hand, the swelling behavior of uncharged gels is not understood yet because the swelling equilibrium is attained depending on a subtle balance among the gel and solvent components. For the elucidation of factors aecting the swelling behavior of the uncharged gel, the understanding of the eect of ions on the hydration of the polymer is probably most important. Some authors have investigated and analyzed the swelling behavior to interpret the interaction between uncharged hydrogel and ions. Inomata et al. [3] reported the eect of inorganic and tetraalkylammonium salts on the change of the phase transition temperature of poly0N-isopropyl
acrylamide) gel and explained it by the water-structuremaking or breaking character of the ions. Takano et al. [4] found ion speci®cities for the degree of swelling of poly0N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) gel at higher salt concentra
tion than 1 mol dm±3: the degree of swelling is in the
order, SO2
4 <F)<Cl)<SCN) £I) for the potassium
salts and Cs+<K+£Na+<Li+£Ca2+£Mg2+ for the chlorides, respectively. Such speci®cities of the gel swelling were interpreted in terms of the enhanced electron donation ability of water molecules hydrating highly charged anions and the enhanced electron acceptance ability of water molecules hydrating highly charged cations. In the present work, the swelling behavior of uncharged poly0vinyl alcohol) 0PVA) gel in aqueous alkali-metal and alkaline-earth-metal salt solutions was investigated. The gel was prepared by c-ray irradiation to avoid any chemical contamination of the gel by a crosslinker [5]. Gel preparation by such a method has the advantage that a gel with a similar hydration property for the solution of the polymer can be obtained. The PVA gel deswelled in the solutions that contained strongly hydrated anions and swelled in the solutions that contained strongly hydrated cations. The results were interpreted by assuming certain interactions through the hydration layers of the polymer and ions, the hydrogenbonding hydration of PVA being taking into account.

Abstract Poly0vinyl alcohol) gel was prepared by c-ray irradiation of an aqueous solution of the polymer and its swelling behavior in solutions of the alkali-metal and alkaline-earthmetal salts was investigated. The gel deswelled in solutions containing strongly hydrated anions and swelled in solutions containing strongly hydrated cations. The degree of swelling of the gel was
in the following order:
SO2
4 <Cl)<Br)  NO
3 <I) for
the anions and K+<Na+<Li+ and
Sr2+<Ca2+<Mg2+ for the cations. These results were interpreted in terms of interactions between the polymer and the ions through the hydration layers.

Experimental
Gel preparation
The PVA used in this study was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. The mean degree of polymerization of PVA was 1,000 and the degree of saponi®cation was 88 mol%. To remove impurities, namely acetic acid and sodium acetate, PVA was washed with methanol by using a Soxhlet extractor for 16 h. The PVA solution was prepared by dissolving 4 wt% PVA in deionized and afterward distilled water under heating with stirring at 90±100 °C for 2 h. The gel was prepared by irradiating the PVA solution with
c-rays of 60Co. The PVA solution was ®lled in glass capillaries of 0.2-mm inner diameter and length 32 mm. The irradiation dose was 25 kGy. Transparent cylindrical gels were obtained without coloring.
Measurement of the degree of swelling
The gels were taken out of the capillaries, cut into specimens about 5-mm long, and immersed in distilled water completely to desalt and equilibrate. Then, the gels were immersed in respective salt solutions for 24 h. The diameter, d, of the gels was measured in the solution with 0.1% deviation. The degree of swelling of the gels was de®ned as the ratio, d/dw, of the diameter in salt solution to
that in distilled water. The ratios of the change in the length of the gel in salt solution were about the same as that of the diameter. All the measurements were carried out at 20.00.1 °C. As salts, analytical grade NaCl, NaBr, NaI, Na2SO4, LiNO3,
NaNO3, KNO3, CsNO3, Mg0NO3)2, Ca0NO3)2 and Sr0NO3)2 were employed.
Results and discussion
Plots of the d/dw values of PVA gel against the salt concentration, cs, of the immersing solution for NaCl, NaBr, NaI, NaNO3 and Na2SO4 are shown in Fig. 1. The d/dw values contain the experimental errors for the diameter measurement and are plotted with error bars in
the ®gure. At cs=2 mol dm±3, the order of the d/dw
values is SO2
4 <Cl)<Br)  NO3)<I). This order
corresponds exactly to the well-known lyotropic series. The interpretation of this series has been established as the order of the strength of the hydration of the ions [6]. In NaCl and Na2SO4 solutions, the gels deswelled and the d/dw values decreased with the increase in the salt concentration. Particularly, for Na2SO4 signi®cant deswelling was observed. The deswelling of PVA gel in these salt solutions can be thought to be primarily the result of the decreased hydration of PVA, because the order corresponds to the strength of the hydration of the anions, which depends on the crystallographic radius of the anions. For Na2SO4 solution, owing to the strong hydrating character of the anion, the resulting increase in the number of the hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of PVA chains results in signi®cant deswelling. For NaBr and NaNO3 solutions, PVA gel deswelled slightly in the higher-concentration region. Generally, ions with crystallographic radius larger than
about 0.15 nm and low surface charge density attract water molecules weakly, which breaks the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules around the ions. The
interaction of Br) and NO
3 with water molecules is
weak as a whole, so it seems that the hydration of PVA molecules is not aected signi®cantly. In NaI solution, PVA gel swelled with the increase in the salt concentration and was red. For NaI solution, the activity of water in PVA gel is reduced to the same extent as in the case of other salt solutions, and deswelling of the gel is expected. However, it is well known that PVA forms a complex with iodine [7, 8]. Similar interaction should take place
in the PVA gel. The binding of I) to the PVA gel enhances the interim hydrophilicity of the PVA chain, giving rise to the swelling of the PVA gel. It is presumed that swelling behavior of PVA gel in NaI solution is determined by the balance of the swelling factors, i.e., the increased hydrophilicity of the PVA gel owing to the
binding of I), and the deswelling factor, the decrease in the activity of water in the gel. The d/dw values of the PVA gel in LiNO3, NaNO3, KNO3 and CsNO3 solutions are shown in Fig. 2. The swelling measurement for CsNO3 was carried out only
up to 1 mol dm)3 for insolubility of the salt at higher concentration. In LiNO3 solution, the gel swelled slightly at the higher concentration. For NaNO3 and KNO3, d/dw was about unity at 0±0.5 mol dm)3 and
deswelled at 1±2 mol dm)3. For CsNO3 solution, d/dw of the gel remained about unity over the whole range of the salt concentration, i.e., neither swelling nor deswelling of the gel took place. For alkali-metal salt solutions, d/dw

of the gel was in the order K+<Na+<Li+. Lozinsky et al. [9] observed similar ion-speci®c swelling of PVA gel made by a freezing±thawing process for alkali-metal
chlorides. At 1 mol dm±3, the water activity of alkali nitrate solutions is in the order LiNO3<NaNO3 <KNO3<CsNO3 [10]. Generally, with a decrease in the water activity in the solution, the gel deswells more. When hydrogel is immersed in salt solution, the activity of water in the gel is reduced and then competition of hydrations between the ions and the polymer components takes place. If the hydration of the solute ions is stronger than that of the polymer, the amount of the hydrating water of the polymer is reduced and the gel deswells. As mentioned previously, PVA gel deswelled more in a solution containing an anion with smaller crystallographic radius and higher charge. However, it is clear from Fig. 2 that PVA gel swells in a solution that
contains a strongly hydrated cation, namely Li+. It
seems that Li+ interacts with hydroxyl groups of PVA chains via the hydration water, giving interim charge
and hydrophilicity to the gel. In the case of Cs+, similarly to the case of other alkali-metal salts, a decrease in the activity of water in the gel takes place
to a lesser extent than Na+ and K+; hence, the deswelling of the gel is less. The degree of swelling of PVA gel in Mg0NO3)2, Ca0NO3)2 and Sr0NO3)2 solutions is shown in Fig. 3.
The gel swelled for these all salts at 0±1.5 mol dm)3 and d/dw of the gel was found to be in the order
Sr2+<Ca2+<Mg2+. The water activity of these salts
at 1 mol dm)3 is in the order Mg0NO3)2<Ca 0NO3)2<Sr 0NO3)2 [10] and the values are lower than
those of alkali nitrates. Therefore the eect of these salts on deswelling of PVA gel may be thought to be stronger than alkali nitrates. In contrast to this anticipation, however, for alkaline-earth-metal salt solutions, PVA gel swelled with an increase in salt concentration up to
about 1.2 mol dm)3. Alkaline-earth-metal ions seemed to interact with hydroxyl groups of PVA chains via the
hydration water similarly to the case of Li+ mentioned earlier. In the higher-concentration region, d/dw of the gel decreased slightly in all cases. It seems that in the higher-concentration region, the degree of the association of the cation and anion becomes higher and, therefore, the eect of the ions on swelling of the gel is lowered. This swelling behavior is dierent between the cation and the anion series: the cation, with stronger hydration, makes the PVA gel more swollen, while the anion, with stronger hydration, deswells the gel more. Okazaki et al. [11] reported the ion-speci®c swelling behavior of the ampholytic PVA gels composed of PVAs containing 10% sulfonate and quaternary ammonium groups, respectively. They assumed that the hydration of the polymer network was dominated by the hydration of the hydroxyl groups rather than by that of the ionic groups and/or hydrophobic groups of the polymer, and on the basis of this assumption, they explained the ion speci®city of the gel from the change in the electron pair donation and acceptance abilities [12] of water molecules. In the case of such ampholytic gels, however, the hydrations of both the ionic groups should be taken into account, which adds some complications in forming the salt bridge between the groups and hence the swelling

behavior. The present study con®rms that the swelling behavior of PVA gel is largely aected by the interaction between hydrated ions and hydroxyl groups on PVA chains. The swelling behavior of PVA gel shown in Figs. 2 and 3 can be reasonably understood by assuming that cations with high charge density interact with the hydroxyl groups of PVA chains via hydration to form interim PVA polycations. Thus, the balance of the binding of hydrated ions to PVA chains assumed earlier
and the decrease in the activity of water in PVA gel becomes the main factor in controlling the swelling behavior of PVA gel in salt solutions. Undoubtedly, speci®c interaction between the polymer moieties and ions through the water in the gel is important for designing of ion-selective functional hydrogels.
