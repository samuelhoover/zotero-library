The very high concentration of macromolecules within cells can potentially have an overwhelming effect on the thermodynamic activity of cellular components because of excluded volume effects. To estimate the magnitudes of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes, concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a correction for the dilution that’ occurs during extraction. That factor is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential or stationary growth phase are estimated to be ~0.3 to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (Zac repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications of the activit’y coefficients to solubility or to association reactions are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules that emulate the crowding conditions inferred for cytoplasm is discussed.

1. Introduction
Biological reactions occur naturally in the concentrated milieux of living cells (Kennel1 & Riezman, 1977; Fulton, 1982; Woldringh & Nanninga, 1985), yet they are generally characterized in dilute solutions. The high volume-occupancy within cells must cause significant changes in many parameters of these reactions (Minton, 1981, 1983, 1990). In formal terms. the parameters determined under dilute, relatively ideal conditions can be corrected for highly concentrated conditions by applying appropriate activity coefficients. The problem then is the evaluation of activit’y coefficients for macromolecules of interest under in vivo conditions of
excluded volume. Although such values will necessarily be rough estimates, they may still be quite useful as first approximations in view of the large corrections anticipated for certain cell reactions. Escherichia coli contains two functionally and physically separated membrane-bounded spaces, namely the cytoplasmic and the periplasmic compartment,s (Ingraham et al., 1983; Oliver, 1987; Stock et aZ., 1977). The periplasm is readily released by lysozyme treatment of the cells; the resulting spheroplasts can be gently ruptured to yield soluble macromolecules charact’eristic of the cytoplasm. We use the properties of such extracts to infer conditions in the cytoplasm. Excluded volume properties of the extracts are derived from gel filtration and

two-phase partition assays (Zimmerman & Trach, 1990). These results are combined with measurements of the dilution of the cytoplasm that occurs during the extraction process in order to estimate activity coefficients under cellular conditions. These calculations are made over a range of values for the average effective specific volume for the cytoplasmic contents indicated by the measurements given in the Appendix.
2. Materials and Methods
(a) (haera
Materials and procedures are as described (Zimmerman & Trach, 19883, 1990) where not specified.
(b) Materials
Crystallized chicken egg white lysozyme (grade I) was purchased from Sigma, crystallized pancreatic DNase I from Millipore, and Blue Dextran 2000 from Pharmacia.
(c) Methods
(i) Cell and spheroplast preparation
Cultures of E. coli C600 were grown with shaking (275 revs/min, New Brunswick gyrotory shaker, model G-25D) in 2 1 flasks containing 67 1 of Luria-Bertani medium (Maniatis et al.: 1982) at 37°C. Exponential cells grew with a generation time of ~30 min and were harvested at, A,,, = 1.5. Stationary phase cells were taken from cultures that were shaken 12 h after exponential growth ceased; these cultures had a final value of pH 7.2, comparable to that of the unused medium (pH 7.5). Cultures were chilled and harvested by centrifugation. Cells for alumina extraction were washed several times with cold 015 iwPu’ac1 and the well-drained cell pellets were frozen with solid CO, and stored at -20°C. Mg2 + -stabilized spheroplasts were prepared by the TES lysozyme Oreatment described by Witholt el al. (1976a,b) using cells freshly grown as described a.bove and washed in 1 mrv-MgCl,. 200 mlvl-Tris’ HCl (pH %O). Quantitative conversion of either exponential or stationary phase cells t,o spheroplasts was indicated by >95o:, of the cells becoming spherical and by >95(;& lysis of portions of the culture based on a direct count after a 12-fold dilution in water. Aft,er addition of Mg(‘1, to stabilize the spheroplasts. cultures were chilled and spheroplasts collected by centrifugation; the supernatant. fluids contained 8 to 11 “0 of the total cell protein and 2 to 4”& of the total cell RNA. The well-drained spheroplast preparations were frozen with solid CO, and stored at -20°C. Cell pellets of washed exponenbial or stationary phase cells contained 0241 or 0239 g dry weight/g packed cells. similar to previous values (Roberts et al., 1955; Schultz & Solomon. 1961; Winkler & Wilson. 1966): dry weights of extracts are listed in the text.
(ii) Extraction of cells and spheroplasts
Concentrated extract,8 of whole cells were made by grinding a partially thawed pellet of cells for 4 min in a chilled mortar at 5°C with I.7 g alumina (t,ype 4-5. Sigma)/g wet weight of cells. The sticky paste was triturated for several minutes with 0.95 ml/g wet weight of cells of extraction buffer (I 7.4 mM-Tris HCI (pH 7.5), 52.1 mM-NH,Cl. 17.4 mM-MgCl,. 10.4 rnM-fi-mercaptoethanol. 1.7 pg pancreat.ir DNase I/ml).
Concentrated extracts of spheroplasts were prepared at 0 to .i”C by manually dispersing a thawed pellet of spheroplasts in 995 ml of extraction buffer/g wet weight of spheroplast pellet in a tube with a loosely fitting Teflon pestle. Extracts were incubated for 20 min at 20°C to decrease their viscosity, chilled and centrifuged for IO min at 39.000 g (18,000 revs/min in a W-34 r‘ot,or. DuPont/Sorvall centrifuge, model R(‘-5 at 5°C”). Ahout 213 of the supernatant, fluids were removed by pipette. and either used directly (for extracts of whole cells) or recentrifuged as described above and the final supernatant fluid used (for extracts of spheroplasts). Port,ions of these “low-speed extracts” were further centrifuged for 6 h at. 106,000 g (30,000 revs/min in a Heckman/Spinco type 30 rot,or at. 5°C) to remove ribosomes (Traub ef /I/.. 197 I ); the resulting supernatant fluids are tjrrmed “high speed extracts”. Extracts were frozen in portions in solid (10, and st,ored at - 20 Y’. The above protocols are designed to yield extracts containing the nominal concent,rations of the components of solution I (Traub et a2.. 1971), namely 10 mM-Tris’ I-R‘1 (pH 7.5), 30 m&r-NH,Cl. 10 mivi-MgCl,, 6 mM-/&mercaptoethanol. as well as 1 ,ng pancreatic DNase I/ml. based upon a.n initial assumption of ~0-70 g water/g wet. weight of cells or spheroplasts (Neidhardt. 1987).
(iii) Water content, dry weight and density w~ea.surrmmts
Water content and dry weights were generally based upon weight loss on drying of samples that were lyephilized and t,hen dried a,t 104°C in rjacuo nntil constant weight (see Appendix also). Sample densities were measured by weighing portions of 300 t,o 500 ~1 contained in tared plastic tips of a pipetting device (model I’-1 000. Rainin Instrument Co.).
(iv) Hard sphere represmtation of naa~)orrroluc:tLles crrt,d effective spec$c volume
Macromolecules are represented as equivalent hard spheres in excluded volume interactions (Minton. 1983). The effective specific volume for t’he hard sphere model in excluded volume interactions is t.he specific solume of t.hr equivalent hard sphere, I: (ml/g). where:

to their concentration in I?. coli c,ytopkzsn/
To estimate the concentration of cytoplasmic macros molecules based on the cencentrations of estract macromolecules, the latter must br quantified a,ntl the dilmion associated with extraction must be determined. The soluble macromolecules in E. roli are rnostl~ composed of RNA and protein (Neidhardt. 1987). In our soluble, DNA-depleted extracts. both t,hr weight. of ac:i& precipitable macromolecules and t,he total dry weight of solutes are within 10il/o of the total weight’ of (RNA + protein) (see Table I). We take t,he total (RNA + protein) content of a cell fraction as an operational definition of its macromolecule content. The dilution upon extmction is measured 1)~ 2 methods. both of which use exclusion of sucrose from the vytoplasmir compart,ment of intact E. coli to operationally define t.hr cytoplasmic volume (St,ork e!t cl.. 1977).


Excluded Volume in E. coli 601
Method 1. This procedure is adapted from the thick
suspension technique described by Mitchell & Moyle (1956) and Weibull (1956). Portions of a very concen
trated suspension of E. coli (@5 ml of 70% (w/w) suspension of cells that were grown as described above and
washed in 0154 M-NaCl) were equilibrated for 30 min at 0°C with 12 pmol sucrose in a total volume of 0.6 ml in a
tared tube; after centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 g at 5”C, the sucrose concentration of the supernatant fluid
was determined. The total weight of water in each reaction mixture, zqotal, and the water contents of the supernatant fluids were determined by drying.
The total weight of water is the sum of contributions from the periplasmic, cytoplasmic and intercellular
volumes of the cell pellet and from the extraction buffer:
Wtolal = Wperiplasm fWcytop~asm + wintercsIluIar f wbufferl (2)
where w is the weight of water. By definition, the weight
of water in the sucrose-permeable fraction of the reaction
mixture is:
wpcrmeable = wperiplasm + Wintercellular + wbuffer. (3)
The cytoplasmic water content for the cells added to the
reaction mixture is given by:
‘wcytoplasm = wtc,~otal - W~ermeabIe~ (4)
wpermeablcis obtained by material balance for sucrose:
Wpermeable = mno cells. wno cells
mcells
(5)
where mnoeells and mcells are amounts of sucrose/unit
weight of total water in the supernatant fluids from
reaction mixtures lacking cells and in complete mixtures containing cells, respectively. w,,,,, is determined as described above. so that w,~,,,~,~~,,,may be obtained from
eqn (4).
The ratio of ~~,o,a,/~cy,op,asmgives the dilution of the
extract on the basis of water content. Correction of the (RrU’A + protein) concentrations of the spheroplast extracts in Table 1 (using concentrations expressed on the basis of water content for this purpose) for this dilution
gives the cytoplasmic concentration of (RNA + protein) in weight/weight of cytoplasmic water. This cytoplasmic
concentration may be converted to the concentration of (RNA + protein) on a weight/volume basis, Ccytoplasm,by using the observed specific volume of solutes in sphero
plast extracts (@66 to 0.67 ml/g based upon dry weight
and density determinations). Method II. In this method, developed for the present study, cells were both washed and extracted in media
containing the same concentration of sucrose; the sucrose concentration in the extract is lowered by release of the
sucrose-free, cytoplasmic volume during extraction. Specifically, cells were washed with either 0.139 M-NaCl in 0031 M-sucrose or 0077 M-NaCl in 0’154 M-SUCrOSe or
@31 ~-sucrose. all of which are of approximately equal
osmolality to our usual 0154 M-EaCl wash medium. The washed cells were extracted with alumina as described
above, except that the extraction medium contained the
same concentration of sucrose used in washing the cells. After cent,rifugation as described above for preparation of
low-speed extracts. the sucrose concentration was
measured in the cell extract. Assuming additirity of the volumes involved, extract
solut,ion volume is given by:
l’extract= Buffer + I’intercellular+ Vcytop~as+m Vperiplasm, (‘3) where I is the solution volume. Since V~y,op,asmdoes not
equilibrate with sucrose before cell breakage, the fraction of vextractthat equilibrates with the sucrose concentration
(8,) of the cell wash and extraction media is:
( vextract- ~cytoplasm;)
the part of Vextract that equilibrates with the sucrose
concentration (8) in the extract is:
( ‘buffer + ‘intercellular + k ’ ~cicytop~asm + vperiplasm) ,
(where k is the fraction of cells broken by the alumina
treatment; k x 095 based upon comparison of alumina extract and spheroplast lysate compositions) which, by
eqn (6) is equivalent to:
( Vextract- (1 - 4 Vcy,op,asm)
Since the total amount of sucrose added to the extraction
mixture is equal to the total amount of sucrose present after the alumina grinding (see control below), then:
( Vextract- J’cy,opmnPo = ( Vextract- (1 -k) . Vcytop,asmP.(7) Rearranging:
Vcytoplasm _ 1 -s/s,
--Vextract I-(1-k)(S/&) (8)
The ratio of cytoplasmic volume to extract volume obtained in eqn (8) is used to convert the observed total
concentration of (RNA + protein) for that extract, c eX,,ac,:to that in the cytoplasm, Ccy,Op,asm:
(9)
Control “extractions” in which cells were replaced by an equivalent amount of extraction medium (containing either O-031 or 031 M-sucrose) caused <5% difference
between the sucrose concentrations in the input medium
and in the respective “extracts”, indicating no significant differential adsorption of sucrose by the alumina. Method II has the advantages of correcting extract
concentrations back to the cytoplasmic compartment of the whole cell, and is on a solution basis rather than in
terms of water content. Combining C~y,op,asmvalues with assay results for spheroplast extracts requires that the same materials are extracted in alumina extracts of whole cells and in spheroplast extracts; gel and other analyses in
Results support this assumption.
The Ccytoplasmvalues obtained by either of the above
methods are converted to values for the volume fraction effectively occupied by the cytoplasmir (RNA + protein),
@, by applying values for the effective specifics volume for excluded volume interactions, w:
@ = v. (~cytoplasm. (10)
(vi) Partition assay and the use of equivalent homogeneous solutions to represent mixtures of macromolecules
We have described an assay for volumes -of macromolecules or average volumes of mixtures of maero
molecules in excluded volume interactions based upon
distribution coefficients of the macromolecules in an aqueous 2-phase system containing PEG 80001 and potas
sium phosphate (Zimmerman $ Trach, 1990).
Distribution coefficients of a series of proteins and other
materials in this system are largely determined by their excluded volume interactions with PEG 8000; current,
studies indicate a similar basis for distribution of a series
of DNA oligonucleot,ides (our unpublished results).

Tie-line A (op. cit.) is used in thr current experiments: sampling of the phases is as before with additional analyses where indicated. The partition assay was standardized in terms of the distribution coefficients of a series of purified proteins (Fig. I ). assuming the molecular
masses listed bv Chrambach (1985). The distribuiion coefficient of a cell extract in terms of its total RNA and protein yields an average molecular mass for those components of the extract by application
of Fig. 1. This molecular mass is converted using eqn (I ) to the radius R* for the solute of a related homogeneous hard-sphere solutiont. Values of R* are weighted by the relative covolumes of the extract components with PEG 8000. This weighting is corrected by eqn (A8) of Zimmerman & Trach (1990), using the size distribution of the extract in the form of its hard-sphere representation from gel filtration. The correction of R* yields the radius (R,) of an effective hard sphere in a homogeneous solution that can be used to represent the extract in calculating approximate activity coefficients for component particles. The use of equivalent homogeneous solutions for this purpose is considered in the Appendix to Zimmerman 8r. Trach (1990). The corresponding particle concentration for this solution (d,, particles/cm3) is obtained by dividing @ by the spherical volume corresponding to R,.
(vii) Gel j&ration
The Sephacryl S-300 column was described (Zimmerman & Trach, 1990). The elution medium (13.89/) (w/w) (1.05 M) potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), in solution I) contains the average buffer concentration in the bottom phase of the partition assay. The column was standardized in terms of the relative elution volumes of a series of purified proteins (Fig. 2). assuming the molecular masses listed by Chrambach (1985). Elution profiles were represented as hard sphere distributions as follows. The average molecular mass for each fraction in the gel filtration pattern was based upon the calibration of Fig. 2. Cumulative plots of (RNA + protein) ~rsus molecular mass were used to determine the amounts of (RNA + protein) in each of the molecular mass ranges shown in Fig. 5. The amounts of RNA in material of M, > 200,000 was represented in equimolar amounts of ribosomal fractions of M, = 900,000 and

For certsin comput,ations. the hard spherta distributions based upon gel filtration profiles drscribrd in thcl preceding paragraph were replaced by homogenrous hard sphere populations that emulate certain excluded volume propert)ies of the whole distributions. Parameters (radius Ra, particle conrrntration d,) for these homogeneous populations were calculated from the hard sphere distributions with eqns (Al) and (A2) of Zimmerman $ Trach (1990). The distributions given in the preceding par+ graph were also used to calculate theoretical values for an experimental parameter from the 2-phase assay, K* (set> subsection (vi). above) by subtracting (X,-R*) (calculated by means of eqn (A8) of Zimmerman $ Trac.h ( 1990) for the PEG 8000 concent’rations measured in t,hr determination of R* in the 2-phase assay) from f?J.
(viii) Polyacrylwmidc- pl &ctrophoresis
Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples for gel electrophoresis were redissolved in the final sample buffer described by Laemmli (1970). incubated for 2 h at :17”(’ (Sigma Technical Bulletin, 1982). and applied t,o SDG/polyacrylamide gels slightly modified from those of Laemmli (1970) to contain a 5oj, (w/v) stacking gel and 12% (w/v) separation gel with a ratio of acrylamide to his-acrylamide of 20; gels were rinsed with loo;, (W/Y) trichloroacetic acidj33?/, (v/v) methanol and stained with (Joomassie brilliant blue (j-250 (Blake&y Xr Boezi. lR77).

those lanes with lanes loaded with the same amounts of PEG 8000.
(ix) Calorimetric determinations
RNA content was determined from the amount of purine-bound ribose that reacted with orcinol (Ashwell,
1957), using a factor of 965 pg RNA/nmol reactive ribose. This conversion factor assumes the average base composi
tion for E. coli RNA in Table 2 of Lombard & Chargaff (1957). Variation in the relative amounts of ribosomal and
tRNA should not significantly affect this calibration given the relatively small amounts of tRNA (Neidhardt, 1987)
and its general similarity in purine content to that of
rRNA (purine/pyrimidine z 1.0 for tRNA and x 1.3 for rRNA: Sirlin. 1972). Our calibration agrees within 10% of
that of Forschhammer & Lindahl (1971).
Protein was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (1951) and by the biuret procedure (Gornall et al., 1949). Crystallized bovine plasma albumin was used as a stan
dard after correcting for the water lost (4.2%) upon drying under vacuum at 104°C. For the 2-phase distribu
tion and gel filtration samples, the more sensitive procedure of Lowry et al. (1951) was applied to portions
precipitated with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and collected by centrifugation; precipitation caused < 5 O/c
difference in apparent protein content when tested with a number of extract samples. Protein concentrations of extracts that were used in determining cytoplasmic pro
tein concentrations were estimated with the much less sensitive but more uniformly responsive biuret procedure. The average deviation between apparent protein concen
trations of representative extracts when measured in the procedure of Lowry et al. (1951) versus that of Gornall et
al. (1949) was 4yc. Sucrose was determined by the resorcinol reaction
(regular assay: Monsigny et al., 1988) in the fraction of
samples that was soluble in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid.
(x) Calculation of activity coefficients by scaled particle theory
An activity coefficient (yi) is calculated for an infinitely
dilute solution of a spherical “test particle” as a function of its radius (Ri) when the test particle is present in
various “backgrounds” of spherical particles. Calculations were made using the scaled particle theory (Reiss, 1965), with an equation for spherical particles (eqn (A3) and
sphere parameters from Table Al of Chatelier & Minton (1987)). For the 1:th test particle:
lny, =--ln(l-@)+ 2 + 4nAR? B2R!
L+1A-a 2( 1 -aq2
1R(?1, 1)
where CD. the volume fraction effectively occupied by
cytoplasmic macromolecules, is evaluated as in section (v), above. For calculation of yi values based upon partition assay
results, the background is the homogeneous solution of spheres of radius R, and number density, d,. In this case,
the parameters for eqn (11) are d = d, = 3@/(47cR%), A =
d&, B = 4ndR2, and C = dRz. For calculation of yi values based upon molecular mass
distributions from gel filtration patterns, the parameters
for eqn (11) are d = Z,d,, A = XjdjRj, B = Xj4ndjR,?, and
C = Z,d,Rf, where dj and Rj are the number density and
radius, respectively, of the hard sphere representations of the.jth molecular mass fraction in the gel filtration profile.
3. Results (a) Approaches and terminology
We seek representations of cell extracts that can be used as cytoplasm-like backgrounds for calculations of activity coefficients of test particles. One
approach is to determine the molecular size distribution of the extracts by gel filtration, and to represent this distribution asan equivalent distribution of hard spheres(Fig. 3). This hard sphere distribution can be used for scaledparticle calculations of the desired activity coefficient (y) values. An entire distribution can also be conceptually replaced for scaled particle calculations by a homogeneous hard sphere solution (radius 4, particle concentration d,). Such a homogeneous substrate solution serves to suggest solutions of purified macromolecules for use as experimental background solutions for studies of crowding in cytoplasm (seeDiscussion).
A second assay technique, two-phase partition, is also used on extracts to obtain parameters of related homogeneous hard sphere solutions (Fig. 3). The two-phase assay gives the radius of a hard sphere, R* (Materials and Methods, section (c) (vi)), which can be compared with its theoretical value calculated for the molecular size distributions determined by gel filtration (Materials and Methods, section (c) (vii)). The R* values from the partition assay must be corrected (for their co-volume weighting with the PEG 8000 of the phase system)
with information from the gel filtration system to obtain parameters of a homogeneous solution of hard spheres(characterized by R,, d,) (Materials and
Methods, section (c) (vi)), which can be used in scaled particle calculations of y values. Because of this correction, the two-phase assay data are not an independent source of y values, but ratsher provide an alternative route to calculation of the desired activity coefficients which incorporates additional extract parameters. The agreement between the results from these two routes helps to test some of
the assumptions of the approach as well as the calibrations of the assays. The various radii that are used to characterize the background solutions should be distinguished from the radius (IQ of the test particle; it is the changes in activity coefficients of the test particles causedby the crowding effects of the background population that are being computed.

(b) Preparation and properties of extracts of E. coli
Extracts of E. coli were made both from sphero
plasts and from whole cells. The spheroplast extracts, prepared by extraction into low osmolality media after freezing and thawing the spheroplasts,
components essentially free of periplas&c-and outer envelope
constituents. Whole cell extracts, prepared by grinding with alumina, are used to estimate in viva concentrations of macromolecules and in tests for internal consistency of the data. The excluded volume contribution from ribosomes is assessed by
comparing extracts before and after removal of ribosomes by centrifugation and by comparing
extracts from cells in the exponential phase of growth with those from cells in st,ationary phase, since ribosome content decreases several-fold upon cessation of active growth (Mendelsohn & Tissiitres. 1959). RNA and protein contents of the extracts

whole cells or of spheroplasts was very similar to the pattern of the total detergent-extractable proteins from whole cells (Fig. 6, lanes 2 or 9 versus lane 1; lade 6 uersus lane 5), indicating that both types of extracts reflect the cellular contents. This similarity of the extracts to the total cellular contents is taken to justify certain relatively arbitrary aspects of the extraction protocols, such as the choice of centrifugal force used to separate the extract from “cell debris” or the choice of extraction medium. Soluble protein patterns from extracts of stationary and exponential growth phase cells are generally similar (Fig. 6, lane 1 versus lane 5). Finally, the patterns are consistent with removal of ribosomal components from the high-speed extract (lane 12) and
their reduction in stationary phase cells (lanes 5 or 6) as judged by the relative absence of many lower molecular mass proteins.

dry weight as periplasmic protein based upon the amount of protein released during preparation of spheroplasts) taken with ~1.5 to 1.8 g of cytoplasmic water per g dry weight of cells (based upon Table 3 of Stock et al. (1977)) yields ~634 to 942 g of (RNA + protein) per g of cytoplasmic water. Assuming the specific volume we find for extract contents (0.67 ml/g), we expect concentrations of the order of ~63 g of (RNA + protein) per ml of cytoplasm. Two protocols are described in Materials and Methods for measuring CCytoplasm,i.e. total (protein + RNA) concentrations in the cytoplasm, in terms of sucrose-impermeable cell volume. The results of these two methods are consistent with each other and with the above estimat,e: L”cytop,asmvalues of ~634 g/ml characterize both exponential and stationarv phase cells (Table 3). This value for Ccytoplasm “is converted with equation (10) to the
values for the excluded volume fraction, Q,. for u = 1.0 or 1.3 ml/g in Table 5.
(d) Two-phase partition of cell extracts
The partition assay was applied to extracts from exponential or stat,ionary growth phase E. coli. A range of concentrations of each extract was tested, resulting in concentrat’ions in the bottom phase that extended to > 200 mg/ml of (RNA + protein). The phase components, PEG 8000 and inorganic phosphate, redistributed in response to addition of the extracts similarly to their responses to additions
of purified components studied previously (Zimmerman & Trach, 1990; data not shown). Examples of RNA and protein contents of the phases are indicated in Table 2. Over 95e/, of the (RNA + protein) is present in the bottom. PEG-poor phase. Small amounts of RNA and protein occur as a layer at the interface and as a pellet
below t’he bot,tom phase. These t,wo fractions each represent ~2 to 30/, of the total RNA and prot’ein in partition experiments with the low-speed extract of exponential cells; interface and pellet, fractions from the other cell extracts were considerably smaller. (SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that these two fractions as manually isolated were largelv composed of the same proteins that were present in the bottom phase. probably due to the presence of small amounts of t,he bottom phase.) The macromolecular composition of t,he bottom phase should be similar to t,hat of the cell fraction from which it comes if t~he partition procedure is not introducing artifacts. This similarity is a result of t’he size-dependence of the partition system, such that macromolecules have distribut’ion coefficients << 1 and. hence. are largely confined to the bottom phase. To evaluate this similarity, samples from the bottom phases were compared with corresponding extracts by their behavior on gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 (Fig. 4(d) fleraus (c), (f) cprsu,s (e)).
by SI)S~polyacr~lamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6. lanes 3 wrsw 2. 7 IWSUX 6. 10 f,er,yu,s 9, and 13 versus 12), and by agaroselacrylamide gels for ribosomal particles (dat)a not shown). The similarity of the pat’terns of the bottom phases to those of the extracts or of whole cells generally indicate a lack of significant changes in the extracts that are attributable to t,he extraction and assay procedures. There is a small loss of ribosomes in the bottom phase relative to the ribosome cont,ent of the extract (Fig. 4.(d) ~versws (c)). The patterns of Figure 6 do not indicate significant, degradation by proteases. The differences in composition in top and bottom phase samples from partition of extracts can be used to check the applicability of the excluded volume basis of the theory described by Zimmerman & Trach (1990). The two phases should be markedly


Excluded Volume in E. coli 609
different in composition, again based upon the sizedependence of the distribution coefficient. The high concentration of PEG in the top phase prevented direct measurement of the size distribution of the macromolecules in the top phase under nondenaturing conditions. Such measurements were,
however, made after separating the macromolecules of the top phase from the PEG by acid-precipitation. Agreement with the expected size-dependence of the distribution coefficients was good up to at least x il4, = 80,000 (corresponding to z 80% of the total protein of the cell extract) as shown by comparison of the theoretical, broken lines and the
experimental points in Figure 7(e) and (f)t.
(e) Excluded volume parameters from partition and gel jiltration assays
The distribution coefficients over the range of extract concentrations tested in the two-phase assay are shown in Figure 8 for the extracts given in Table 2; coefficients are plotted as a function of the concentration of total (RNA + protein) in the bottom phase. Since there is no obvious concentra
tion dependence, we have applied the calibration of Figure 1 to the mean of the five values for each extract shown in Figure 8 to obtain an average molecular mass for that extract. Those molecular
masses are then used to calculate values of R* with equation (1) (Table 4). Similar analyses (not shown) based on the distribution properties of the protein component alone indicated that the soluble proteins control the value of R* and, in a real sense, dominate the macromolecular crowding in these extracts. The values of R* from the two-phase assay data
t The overall distribution coefficient at a given gel location will be the weight average of the coefficients for the species at. that location (Zimmerman & Trach, 1990). Values below the theoretical lines are expected for those polypeptides that are bound in particles or oligomers at the time of distribution between the phases. since such components will have the smaller distribution coefficients of the larger species but will
appear on the gel at the position of the polypeptide
length. For example, a protein of M, = 50,000 composed
of two 25.000 polypeptides will appear on the gel at the position of 25,000 species but will have the distribution coefficient’ (K) of the 50,000 species (K z 04IO3) rather than that of 25,000 species (K z @03). This effect is particularly marked for ribosomal components, since a particle of ribosomal dimensions has a distribution coefficient z lOOO-fold lower than that of the proteins of which it is composed. While theoretically the aggregation state could be changed by the concentration
of extra&. no obvious changes in gel patterns have been
seen as a function of concentration of extract in the assay for a >20-fold difference in total RXA and protein concentration. There are also several polypeptides with Ki values much greater than their denatured molecular mass would indicate. Such fluctuations could be the result of an unusually small effective specific volume or from preferential interactions with the PEQ 8000.

are compared with theoretical values for R* calculated from the corresponding gel filtration profiles (Table 4). The relatively good agreement between
these two sets of values for R* indicate that the extracts partition in the two-phase assay generally
as expected from the hard sphere representations of the corresponding gel filtration profiles. This agreement supports the calibrations for Figures 1 and 2, as well as the use of the gel filtration profiles to correct for the covolume-dependent weighting of R* from the two-phase assay. That correction yields the R, values of Table 5, i.e. the values for homogeneoushard spheresolutions that are used as cytoplasm-like background solutions for the calculations
in the following section. The values of R, are generally comparable to the corresponding $ values (Table 5), which are based only on the hard sphere representations of the gel
filtration profiles.
(f) Calculation of activity coeficientsfor the cytoplasm of E. coli
Our goal is to calculate rough activity coefficients
for a macromolecule of interest (the “test particle”) when present in a distribution of background particles that approximates the macromolecules in the
cytoplasm of E. coli. Test particles of effective radius 4 up to 6 nm are considered, corresponding
to values of Mr x 540,000 to 420,000 for effective
specific volumes (v) of I.0 to 1.3 ml/g; this choice of

Activky coefficients are calculated with a scaled particle equation for the hard sphere representations of extracts from either exponential or stationary growth phase cells.

are for v = I.3 ml/g and curves 3 and 4 are for
ts= 1.0 ml/g. Continuous lines are calculated from the gel filtration profiles of Fig. 5 as in Materials and Methods; values calculated from the corresponding R, and d, values in Table 5 were superimposable on the continuous curves (not shown). Broken lines are calculated for the R, and d, values in Table 5.
Activity coefficients are calculated for molecules of interest when present in such background solutions. Hard sphere representations are sought in order to apply scaled particle theory to the calculation of y values. Scaled particle calculations with hemoglobin and other purified macromolecules have been in substantial agreement with experiment over very wide ranges of concentration (Ross & Minton. 1977a,b; Minton & Edelhoch, 1982; Minton, 1981, 1983). The use of an effective hard sphere representation for the cytoplasmic contents is supported by the general agreement between the distribution coefficients for the bulk of proteins with values predicted for their hard sphere representations (points versus broken lines in Fig. 7(e) and (f). Since the sizes of the background spheres are estimated from the partition and gel filtration behaviors of the cell extracts, it is important to judge to what extent the extracts resemble the nonnucleoid fraction of the cytoplasm of E. coli. The salt concentrations in the partition and gel filtration assays are high ( z@3 to 1 M-phosphate buffer plus small amounts of other solutes), but not that much different than values observed in viva (see discussion by Schultz & Solomon, 1961; Epstein & Schultz. 1965). SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates a protein composition in the phase samples that is very similar to that of the cell. The basic ribosomal structure is stable under distribution conditions, although a fraction of the proteins are stripped from the particles as noted previously. Ribosomes are presumably released from polysomes under extraction and partition conditions; trial calculations (not shown) indicate that such changes do not significantly alter the curves of Figure 9. DNA appears to be sequestered in vivo into one or more nucleoids (Ingraham et al., 1983; Woldringh & Nanninga, 1985) and probably makes little contribution to the excluded volume in the cytoplasmic compartment surrounding the nucleoids. The extracts tested here have been treated with pancreatic DNase I to avoid an undefined partial state of DNA degradation due t,o endogenous nucleases and to decrease the viscosity of the extracts. Proteins originally bound to t.he DNA under cellular conditions will be released. Tt is inter

esting that after phage infection, the nucleoid as a separate entity disappears (Snustad & Conroy, 1974), yielding a cytoplasm that has some similarities to the extracts used in the present assay.
(b) Effective specific volume for crowding interactions
The value of v, the effective specific volume in crowding interactions of a given material as an
equivalent hard sphere, has a large effect on the estimates of activity coefficients (see examples in the following section). It is expected (Minton, 1980)
that v will have a value between its partial specific volume and its specific volume as a hydrodynamic particle, or roughly between ~07 and z 1.3ml/g for a typical protein (Kuntz & Kauzmann, 1974). In our initial description of the two-phase assay (Zimmerman & Trach, 1990) we assumedan average effective specific volume in crowding interactions of 1.3 ml/g dry weight of macromolecule to fix the value of the only adjustable parameter of the assay.
Several considerations indicate that values of v = 1.0 to 1.3 ml/g for an average hard sphere effective specific volume in crowding interactions are appropriate in the current study (as well as in our previous study). (1) The composition of precipitates of a number of proteins from PEG 8000 solutions were used to set limits on the effective specific volume of such
materials under crowded conditions (seeAppendix). A range of values of z 1.4 to 1.9 ml/g dry weight were obtained for the proteins in several media, corresponding to v = 1.0 to 1.4ml/g dry weight when interpreted as equivalent hard spheres. (2) Crystalline macromolecules are a rich source of information on close-packing. Mathews (1977) tabu
lated V,, the ratio of the volume of the unit cell to the molecular mass of protein in that cell, for 226 protein crystals; values range over z threefold and have a small tendency to increase wit,h M,. The most common value of V, for these crystals was
2.2 A3/dalton, corresponding to 0.98 cm3/g for equivalent hard spheres. (3) Estimates of the fraction of “bound water” in crystals or solutions of protein provide another estimate of v, although the definition of bound water is somewhat arbitrary (Kuntz & Kauzmann. 1974).
An average value of %0.25 g bound water/g protein
was suggested by Mathews (1977) for crystalline proteins from results for bot,h crystallographic and other techniques. This fraction of bound water
corresponds to v % 1.0 ml/g protein for equivalent hard spheres (assuming an average partial specific
volume of the proteins of 0.73 ml/g). (4) The indicated range for v is probably also
consistent with certain in, vivo results of Mitchell & Moyle (1956). They measured cytoplasmic volume (as inorganic phosphate-impermeable voiume) of
cells of Bacterium coli over a range of NaCl concentrations. Cytoplasmic volume decreased from a
value of 3.09 ml/g cell dry weight for cells in @2M-NaCl to approach a limiting value of 1.33 ml/g
cell dry weight at high, plasmolyzing NaCl concen
trations. If this 2.3-fold increasein concentrations of cytoplasmic constituents is taken to be t,he limit. imposed by close-packing of cytoplasmic cot]stituents, those constituents should then be 2*3-fold more dilute under normal growth conditions and hence occupy %(l/2.3) = 0.43 ml/ml cytoplasm.
Applying our experimental value for the macromolecule concentration in cytoplasm of X034 g (RNA + protein)/ml cytoplasm (or zW35 g/ml including DNA (Neidhardt,, 1987)), this occupancy corresponds to a bulk effective specific volume of cytoplasmic macromolecules of %1.2 to 1.3ml/g; t.0 derive an average effective specific volume for a hard sphere representation of the macromolecules.
this bulk value must be corrected for an unknown fraction of interstitial volume. Although this bulk value corresponds to v z @94ml/g dry weight if t,he cytoplasm is considered as an equivalent, homogeneous population of spheres, this may not be appropriate model for the actual packing of the cytoplasmic components. (5) The suggested range in average effective
specific volume is not inconsistent with values for individual proteins obtained by fit’ting a hard sphere model to experimental data (0.92 ml/g for hemoglobin (Ross et al., 1978) and 1-5ml/g for serum albumin (interpolation of the data in Table 1 of Minton & Edelhoch (1982) to the pH value (pH 6.9 t’o 7.0) of the 2-phase system).
(6) Finally, we note that the activity coefficients estimated by the two experimental techniques agree considerably better with each other for 2’= 1.O or 1.3 ml/g than for u = @7ml/g (calculations not shown). Given the scaled particle equation we use?. the largest, source of uncertainty for the calculations of
the y values of Figure 9 seemst’o be in the proper value of 11.The magnitudes of the effects of the suggestedrange of 1~= 1.0 to 1.3 ml/g are indicated by the differences between curves 1 and 2 v~rs’~~.3~ and 4 of Figure 9(a) or (b). Uncertainty in y values from the estimated errors for (R, d) parameters of the various background solutions is probably mncbh

(c) Implications for in vivo function
In earlier studies, we noted that crowding with synthetic polymers such as polyethylene glycol or dextrans could increase the extent of binding of
several DNA polymerases to DNA; the increased binding greatly extended the functional range of the polymerases, counteracting the inhibitory effect from high salt concentrations or from other perturbants. We suggestedthat macromolecular crowding might have global effects upon intracellular binding
reactions; the term metabolic buffering was
suggestedfor the anticipated homeostatic effects of increased binding under highly volume-occupied but perhaps otherwise strongly dissociating conditions (Zimmerman & Harrison, 1987; Zimmerman & Trach, 19SSa).The mot,ivation for the present study was to provide an experimental basis for estimating the magnitudes of such effects in a biologically interesting sample.
The position of equilibrium in association reactions is subject to excluded volume effects (Minton, 1981, 1983; Berg, 1990b) if the effective volumes of the reactants and products differ. The effects can be highly model-dependent (Berg, 1990b). We take as an example the equilibrium between a monomer and its dimer, stipulating that the effective volume
of the dimer is twice that of the monomer, and assuming a spherical shape for all part’icipants. The apparent equilibrium constant for dimerization, K apparen,i,s related to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant for dimerization, K”, by the act’ivity

The activity coefficients shown in Figure 9 are large, reinforcmg the belief that excluded volume corrections will be important under conditions in viz~o.Tt should be emphasized in the application of the curves of Figure 9 that such corrections are only
one aspect of the internal milieu; these corrections may be opposed by non-specific effects such as those due to ion concentrations (see discussion of lac repressor, below) or by specific effects due to interactions with small molecules (substrates and products, allosteric effecters, etc.) or other macromolecules. Further: we re-emphasize that our activity coefficient estimates are dependent upon
the assumptions and model we have chosenand can provide “order of magnitude” estimates of activity coefficients at best. Bearing these limitations in mind, the application of values from Figure 9 to solubility and association reactions are illustrated below (see Minton (1981, 1983) for extensive descriptions of effect’s of crowding upon these reacGons). These activity coefficients will also be applied to a striking discrepancy that has been observed between the in vitro and in aivo properties of lac

macromolecular concentrations estimated for E. coli cytoplasm. A similar calculation for the equilibrium
between a monomer of x 40,000 molecular mass and its tetramer indicates shifts of %lo3 to 105. These effects on solubility and association may dramatically affect the formation of aggregates of macromolecules, even those orchestrated by only
relatively non-specific, weak molecular interactions. Becausey values increase so rapidly with size of the test particle, the tendencies toward insolubility and toward aggregation just discussed may be greatly increased for larger particles such as ribosomal subunits, viruses, etc. in the absence of contravening effects.
Large values of cytoplasmic activity coefficients suggest that macromolecules, in general, will be much less soluble in cytoplasm than in dilute surroundings. The solubility of a macromolecule is decreasedin inverse proportion to its activity coefficient (assuming constant’ activity of the macro
molecule in the solid phase: Minton, 1983). The yi values of Figure 9(a) indicate that a relatively insoluble protein of about the size of carbonic anhyd
rase (il!li z 31,000. Ri z 2.3 or 2.5 nm at c = I.0 or 1.3ml/g) could be as much asan order of magnitude
lesssoluble in cytoplasm than in a dilute solution containing the same soluble low molecular mass
components. whereas a molecule the size of serum albumin (-Vi z 67.066. corresponding to 4 ~3.0 or
The potential of excluded volume effects to
rationalize in vivo phenomena is illustrated by application of our results to an interesting discrepancy between in vivo and in, vitro behavior shared by two very well-studied probeins, lac repressor and RNA polymerase. Both the binding of lac repressor to DNA (Riggs et al.. 1970; Barkley, 1981; Winter et al., 1981) and the binding of E. coli RNA polymeraseto the AP, promoter (Roe et al., 1984; Roe & Record, 1985) are strongly inhibited by high salt concentrations in typical uncrowded in vitro solu
tions. In contrast, Richey et al. (1987) found that both syst,ems are little affected by similarly high intracellular concentrations of salt. They suggested
that this difference might be at, least partially due to relatively larger numbers of non-specific DNA binding sites in vivo than under typical in vitro conditions. To test the effects of such differences on the expected salt dependencies, they applied the
equilibrium model of von Hippel et al. (1974) for competitive binding of repressor to specific versus
non-specific DNA sequences.Although the calculations of Richey et al. show that non-specific sequencesdo, indeed, greatly reduce the salt dependence of repressor-operator binding for both wildtype and the two mut’ant operators that they char

acterized, the extents of reduction led them to conclude that “. . other features of the in viva environment are undoubtedly important. .“. We have used our estimates of activity coefficients in the model of von Hippel et al. (1974) to test the effect of excluded volume in that environment. The interaction of repressor (R) with operator (0) to form the specific complex (RO) is taken t’o have a thermodynamic association constant KRo defined by equation (13), where C indicates molar concentration:
(13)
(An association constant for interaction with nonspecific DNA sites (D); KRD, would be written similarly.) To obtain the values for the activity coeficients of macromolecules from Figure 9. it is necessary to estimate the sizes of the hard sphere representations of those molecules. It is far from clear how to represent the DNA. Is DNA relatively free in the non-nucleoid cytoplasm or is it relatively immobilized within the nucleoid? It is obviously not well-represented as a sphere. Fort’unately, the value of t’he activity coefficient of the DNA is likely to be similar to that of its complex with repressor, so that) changes in the two activity coefficients will tend to cancel each other, as indicated in the approximation in equation (13). In addition, y,, and yRO may be relatively unaffected by excluded volume effect’s to the extent that the DNA is anchored by supramolecular relationships; if so: these species may suffer only relatively small further entropic changes due t’o crowded cytoplasmic conditions. The tetrameric lac repressor (M, = 154,000; Beyreut’her. 1978) would be represented by spheres of radius ~3.9 or 4.3 nm for u = 1.0 or 1.3 ml/g. which, based upon Figure 9(a). would have values of yR x IO4 or lo*. Such values of yR yield free energy changes in the binding reaction of c+:-6 and - 11 kcal (as compared to values of z - 18 kcal for binding under typical dilute solution conditions; 1 cal = 4.184 J (Harkle) & Bourgeois: 1978)). We have used a modified version of the von Hippel et al. (1974) model t,o calculate the effect of crowding upon the fraction of unbound luc operator over a range of salt concentrations; details are given in the legend to Figure 10. Adequacy of the calculation is suggested by good correspondence between theory and observed values at low salt levels (curves z’ersu8 circles, Fig. 10). In the absence of crowding effects, increased salt levels cause a theoretical derepression similar to that calculated by Richey it trl. (1987): this salt-induced derepression contrasts wit,h the salt-independence of the experimental data (continuous curves versus squares, Fig. 10). A quite different result is, however, obtained if excluded volume effects are taken into account. Our calculation predicts t’hat excluded volume effects will act in opposition to the salt effect and that’ corrections in the range anticipated from Figure 9 can reduce the salt dependency to within the experimentall>
observed range (broken and dotted lines WLSUY syuares, Fig. lo)?. Garner et al. (1990) suggested an c~xplanation to1 the discrepancy between the in ui~r;o anal ir/ c*itro salt effects that also stems from possible homeostat,ica effects of high volume occupancy. but which is based upon an increase in tytoplasmic protein con centration observed in growth media of increased osmolarity. Such increased occupanciy should certainly further increase binding; it is not obvious that the increased binding will significantly c*hange levels of gene expression. iiven t’he large values t,hat we estimate for the activity coefficient of the repressor under normal growth conditions. Approximations similar to those made above for the lnc repressor ran be applied to the RIVA polymerase-promoter interactions. C:iven the large size of E. coli RNA polymerase (M, z 450,000: Chamberlin. 1982). carowding alone could make an energetic contribution comparable to or greater than the total binding energies estimated for t,his equilibrium (Strauss et nl.. 1980: Rots it trl.. 1984: Yager & von Hippel, 1991) at an assumed effectivcl specific volume of either 1.0 or 1.3 ml/g. Wr conclude that the discrepancy bet’ween the in r+tro and 1:n ciao results for both lrcc repressor and for RNA polymerase can be at least part.ially explained by t,hr anticipat,ed excluded volume effect)s.
Mitchell 8: Moyle (1956) and St)oc*k d al. (t!)77) have found changes of as much as several-fold in cytoplasmic volume in response to clhanges in solute concent,rations in t)he culture medium.

(0) experimental P values from Jobe et al. (1974) (averaged P values plotted arbitrarily at ti2 M-KC1 with error bar indicating our estimate of range of probable intracellular salt concentrations) and (H) represent) values from Richey et al. (1987). Theoretical values for the fraction of open operator are calculated with the model of von Hippel et al. (1974) as modified by eqn (13) for values of yR = 1. 104, or lo8 (continuous broken or dotted lines. respectively). Cellular concentrations assumed: total repressor = 1.7 x 10m8 M and total operator sites = 1,7-9 YI based on von Hippel et al. (1974): total non-specific DNA binding sites =8.3X4 M, corresponding to 596 of the base-pairs of DNA, based on the paper by Berg (1990a). The relatively small changes in activity coefficient’ of the salt with concentration (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 1964) are ignored. Binding constants are based upon those measured in 3 mi%-Mg* + for specific interactions of repressor with wild-type operator and for non-specific interaction with E. coli DNA by Lin & Riggs (1975); their eqn (2) was converted to molar
units assuming t,he size of the non-specific binding unit to be a single base-pair of 600 Mr. Reductions in specific
binding constants for 0’640 and 0’666 of 7%fold and
67-fold are based on values in Table 2 of Jobe et al. (1974) for wild-t,ype repressor in 02 M-KCl. The relative saltdependencies of the operators observed by Mossing & Record (1985) (but not t’heir absolute values) are maintained, in that the salt-dependence for all non-specific binding constants and for the specific binding constant of O”640 are taken to be the same as each other, and the salt dependence for specific binding of wild-type operator and of 0’666 are taken to be the same as each other. The
compartment under most conditions (Schultz & Solomon, 1961). Such crowding changes may allow internal re-equilibration of certain cellular components with possible applications to industrial or other situations. A potential complication to such experiments is a transient induction of permeability by osmotic shifts (Britten & McClure, 1962; our unpublished results).
(e) Experimental solutions to replace cytoplasm for in vitro crowding studies?
In principle, actual solutions of individual macromolecules could be used as artificial, cyt,oplasm-like backgrounds in experimental studies of crowding effects. The entries for @ = 0.34 or @ = @44 in Table 5 correspond to average M, % 72,000 or 79,000, both at 340 mg/ml. A globular protein in this size range and at this concentration might provide a feasible background in which to estimate crowding effects if certain conditions were met. The background macromolecule must neither undergo significant self-aggregation nor specific interactions with the components being tested. It is important to note that at these very high concentrations, even weak specific interactions can become significant, so it is incumbent to test the effect of more than one background material on a test system. Certain of t’hese difficulties may be ameliorated by a suitable choice of solvent and by chemical or genetic engineering of potent’ial background macromolecules. We also not’e our unsuccessful earlier att,empts to chemically or physically inactivate extracts so that they become innocuous backgrounds. For a variety of crowding-sensitive reactions. only unacceptably harsh treatment of extracts prevented specific interferences such as hydrolysis of substrates or produ&s. precipitation, etc. (our unpublished results).
(f) Further applications of thP approach
The present approach may be applicable to certain other biological materials. It should be wellsuited to Gram-positive bacteria; these cells lack a periplasmic space (Ingraham et al., 1983), considerably simplifying the analysis. The cytoplasm of bacteriophage-infected cells would be of comparative interest, since the host nucleoid structure is degraded (Snustad & Conroy, 1974). It should be possible to apply the present
equations used to describe the salt dependencies are:
log z&n@-‘) = -9%.c”‘2+7%4
log K,o(M-‘) = - 7.3. (r112 + 14.76 for wild-type

log KRo(LW-l) = - 7.3. Cl/’ + 12.93 for 0’666,

methods to extracts of those eukaryotic cells that
have a relatively homogeneous internal structure, such as human or other non-nucleated erythrocytes. In contrast, most eukaryotic cells have complex internal structures, containing large amounts of a, variety of filaments and subcellular organelles (Porter, 1985; Osborn & Weber, 1985). It is not’ clear whether the “cytosol” of such cells can be profitably used to assessthe cytoplasm: Clegg (1984) argued
that the simple solution behavior of “cytosol” is an artefact of the extraction process. Extracts of isolated subcellular organelles may, however, be fruitful subjects for the current approach. It may be noted how easy it is to generate and
manipulate solutions at >200 mg/ml of (RNA + protein) in the present t,wo-phase system. A second partition would probably yield even higher concentrations. This capability may be useful in ot,her types of studies.
(g) C~oncluding comment
We view these experiments and calculations asa,n initial attempt to define a verv complex system. Certain trends seen clear. Given the modeldependence and the approximations of our approach? quantification of in uivo excluded volume effects on real systems remains a goal for the future.
APPENDIX
Effective Hard Sphere Volumes for Macromolecules Based on the
Composition of Precipitates from Polyethylene Glycol Solutions
This Appendix describes a procedure for obtaining the specific volume of proteins or other macromolecules in closely packed precipitates induced with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and isolated by serial centrifugations. These specific volumes are used to estimate corresponding specific volume values for equivalent hard sphere represen
tations of the macromolecules (used in the main text). Although PEG precipitation of proteins has been widely studied (Atha & Ingham, 1981; Haire et al., 1984; Ingham, 1990; Juckes, 1971; Middaugh et al., 1979; Polson et al., 1964), compositions of the
solid phasesdo not appear to have been described in sufficient detail for the present purposes.
Tared conical capped polypropylene tubes (1.5 ml, Brinkmann Industries, Westbury, NY) contained 25 to 50 mg of dry weight of proteins or other macromolecules and varying concentrations of PEG 8000 in solution I (seeabove) or in solution I
containing 92 M-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (total vol. = 1.2 ml). After 20 minutes at’ 20°C with repeated mixings, tubes were subjected to
a series of centrifugations for 20-minute periods at 20°C at increasing centrifugal forces (Sorvall model
RC-5 centrifuge, angle-head rotor (model SS-34) with adapters yielding &,,, z 7 cm): after an initial
centrifugation at 9000 revs/min, the bulk of the fluid was removed for analyses by pipetting and the remaining supernatant fluid was removed by aspira

disturbing the pellet?; the tube and contents were

aspirating and weighing after each centrifugation. Wet pellets were finally resuspended in 0.8 ml of cold 5oj, trichloroacetic acid for ten minutes at 0°C and centrifuged for ten minutes at 20,000 revs/mm at 5°C to precipitate the protein and other macromolecules and to extract the PEG and salts. Portions of this extract were assayed as described previously to determine the total weight in the
pellets of PEG (wrao) and of inorganic phosphate (Wphosph)at(eZimmerman & Trach, 1990). The acid
insoluble pellets were lyophilized for a few hours and then dried to constant weight in vacua at 104”( to obtain the dry weight of the protein or other macromolecules, wdryrelle,. Control experiments indicated that acid-precipitation of the macro
molecules was quantitative and that the trichloroacetic acid did not contribute to the final weight of the dried pellets. Control tubes were used to correct for a characteristic decrease (~2.5 mg) in t,arr weight of the tubes that occurs during vacuum
drying. The limiting weight of the wet pellet when no more fluid can be removed by centrifugation. 4L pellet,was estimated for the five centrifugations
before acid precipitation from the y-intercept of
plots of the value for w,,,reliet after a centrifugation versus the weight loss in that centrifugation
(Fig. Al). The total weight of water, 10,,~,,, was obtained as:
tw:et pellet - Wdry pellet - WPEG - ‘“phosphate);
this value differed by < 3% from water weight
measured directly for a number of samples by
vacuum drying of wet pellets that were not acid-precipitated.

For calculation of the volume of the wet pellet, we
assumespecific volumes (ml/g) for water of 1.00, for proteins of 0.73 (Kuntz & Kauzmann, 1974), for PEG 8000 of 0.83 (Molyneaux, 1983) and for phosphate of 930 (obtained from direct measurement in preparation of buffer stock used in the 2-phase
system). The specific volume for macromolecules in the pellet is obtained by equation (Al):
specific volume =
W water + o’73wdr,pellet + 083wPEG + 0*30Wphosphate
Wdry pellet + WPEG (Al)
Average compositions of the pellets are summarized in Table Al. For the samplesprecipitated from 92 M-phosphate/solution I, PEG was largely absent
from the pellets (<3% of the pellet weight, corresponding to w l/4 of the initial PEG concentration); in contrast, inorganic phosphate was highly concentrated in the pellets of these samples, fortuitously
reaching levels comparable to those used in the distribution and gel filtration assays of the main text. The values of w,,,~~,,~~ were little affected by changes in centrifugal force or by changes in PEG concentration over significant ranges of either variable. This invariance indicates that a limit in
packing density was being approached. Since phase separation of proteins by PEG appears to result from excluded volume effects (Edmond & Ogston, 1968; Juckes, 1971; Middaugh et al, 1979; Atha & Ingham, 1981; Knoll & Hermans, 1983; Ingham, 1990), we took the limiting specific volume values

obtained as those of macromolecules closely packed by volume exclusion. These values can be used to calculate the specific volume of an equivalent hard sphere representation by applying a volumeoccupancy of 74% for close-packed spheres (Scott, 1960). Specific volumes calculated with equation (A 1) are shown in Figure A2(a) and (b) for several proteins in several media, and in (c) for exponential and stationary phase extracts of E. coli. The experimental values for the proteins seem to be consistent with the range of 1.0 to 1.3 ml/g for equivalent hard sphere specific volumes (shown by lower and upper broken lines in Fig. A2) t’hat is used in the main t’ext for calculation of certain excluded volume effects. The specific volumes of the extracts are somewhat) higher than those of the homogeneous materials. While this increase may reflect actual differences in specific volumes of materials, it seems more likely to be a result of less dense packing because of molecular size heterogeneity (Dickinson & Parker, 1985). The estimates of hard sphere specific volumes obtained here are compared with those from other sources in t’he Discussion in the main text.
