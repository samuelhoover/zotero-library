ABSTRACT: The swelling of poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) gels and the osmotic pressure of linear PAAm in aqueous solutions were predominantly affected by anion type and increased according to the lyotropic series ranking of sodium halide anions: F  (H2O)
 Cl  Br  I. The osmotic pressure of PAAm in all examined salt solutions followed the scaling theory, with an exponent of 2.3  0.1. In solutions of a sodium halide series, the value of the pre-exponential factor seemed to depend on salt concentration, anion radius, and the apparent “anionic-portion radius” of the water molecule. This radius, extracted from the literature data, marks a transition point of the anion radius effect. Larger anions increase the osmotic pressure of PAAm more significantly as their concentration increases and vice versa. The effects of the anions on the osmotic pressure of PAAm are related to their preferential interactions with the polymer. Iodide, which increased the osmotic pressure of PAAm with respect to its value in pure water, seemed to preferentially adsorb onto the polymer with a binding constant of Kb

INTRODUCTION
Water-soluble polymers are attracting increasing interest because of their important role in bioengineering, medicine, food, cosmetics, and other fields. One of the important topics is their interaction with low-molecular-weight cosolutes. This
interaction is considered one of the main factors governing various aspects of polymer behavior in aqueous solutions. The influence of salts on charged polymers and gels is quite well understood and is mainly attributed to screening of electrostatic interactions by salt ions and to the Donnan effect.1–6 However, the influence of salts on nonionic water-soluble polymers or on polyelectrolytes at higher salt concentrations is much less understood. The ability of inorganic salts to shift the sol– gel transition temperature of thermoreversible gels7–9 as well

as the lower critical solution temperature of hydrophobic water-soluble polymers10–12 have been investigated extensively. The influence of salts on the swelling or contraction of nonionic polymer gels has also been examined.13–16 These salt effects, like salting-in or -out, are characterized by ion specificity. Many studies have shown that the magnitude of various salt effects varies according to the lyotropic or Hofmeister series.7–9,17,18 Both the charge and the size of the ion play important roles in determining its lyotropic effects.19–21 Several studies suggest that ions directly interact with macromolecules by binding to their hydrophilic groups.22–26 Other studies suggest an indirect interaction with the polymer through perturbation of the water environment or by induction of changes in hydrogen bonding of water to the polar groups of the polymers.27–29 One of the mechanisms explaining salting-out effects in aqueous solutions of uncharged polymers suggests that salt-depleted zones are formed near polymer segments because of the repulsiveimage forces30,31 (the effective repulsion between ions and low dielectric interfaces). However, the salting-in phenomenon was suggested to be the result of binding of the ions to the polar groups of the polymer, for example, amide or hydroxyl dipoles.22,23,32 Experimental evidence for the binding or repulsion of ions to nonionic polymers in aqueous solution was also obtained by NMR.25,33 Nonionic hydrophilic homopolymers are good model systems for examining lyotropic salt effects, especially when interactions with certain hydrophilic groups of the polymer are explored. Several aspects of interactions between inorganic salts and nonionic hydrophilic polymers (NIHP) and their gels have been investigated, the polymers being poly(ethylene-oxide) (PEO),30,31,34,35 polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP),26,31,36 dextran,3,31,37,38 and poly(acrylamide) (PAAm).31,39–41 Osmotic pressure and gel-swelling measurements may serve as useful criteria for investigating lyotropic salt effects on polymers because these polymers do not exhibit a cloud point or a gel volume-phase transition in the commonly occuring temperature range (0 –100 °C) for aqueous solutions. Recently, we investigated the impact of inorganic salts on the swelling of dextran gel beads and on the osmotic pressure of the polymer solution measured across a membrane impermeable to the polymer only.37 The effects of salts on the swelling of dextran gel followed their ranking in the lyotropic series. A similar pattern was found for the influence of the salts on the osmotic
pressure of the polymer solution and on the salt concentration imbalance during osmotic equilibrium. This was interpreted as a positive preferential interaction because of binding of salting-in salts (e.g., NaSCN) or a negative preferential interaction and a repulsion of salting-out salts (e.g., Na2SO4) from the vicinity of the dextran chains. The main objective of this work is to investigate the mechanisms of effects of inorganic salts on PAAm as a model for NIHPs. The phenomena studied include swelling of gels, osmotic pressure, and intrinsic viscosity of the soluble polymer solutions. To seek evidence for different preferential interactions between PAAm and inorganic salts, we also measured the salt concentration imbalance during the osmotic pressure determinations and interpreted it in terms of “salt excess.” This was defined as the molal imbalance divided by the molal concentration of the polymer monomers. Isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) was used to examine ion binding to the polymer. The following derived objectives were also set: (1) to study the effects of ion type and size on PAAm gel swelling and (2) to quantify the effect of the anion radius on the osmotic pressure of PAAm. For the quantification of the anion radius effect we chose a homologic lyotropic series of anions of monovalent sodium salts: F, a relatively strong salting-out ion; Cl and Br, mild salting-in ions; and I, a strong salting-in ion. This choice of anions eliminates both ionic charge and shape influences. To compare anion and cation effects, we also examined the swelling of PAAm gels in solutions of monovalent alkali chlorides with the following cations: Li, Na, K, and Cs. The elucidation of preferential interactions between NIHP and ions in aqueous solutions is of great importance for a better understanding of the ions effects on biopolymer conformation, physicochemical behavior, and biological function.

Materials for PAAm Preparation
AAm—as above, methyl alcohol (Frutarom) and H2O2 30% w/w in water (Carlo Erba Reagenti) were used.
Salts
NaF (Riedel-deHa ̈en), NaCl (Frutarom Ltd.), NaBr (Carlo Erba-Codex), NaI (Merck), LiCl (Riedel-deHa ̈en), KCl (Merck), and CsCl (RiedeldeHa ̈en) were used, and NaN3 (Fluka) at 0.02% was used as a preservative. All salts were of analytical purity.
Methods
Preparation of PAAm Gels (Modified from Victor42)
PAAm gels were prepared by free-radical copolymerization of AAm and N-N-methylenebisacrylamide (Bis) crosslinker. A low acrylic acid content (0.005%) grade of AAm (Sigma A-3553) was used to avoid charges on the polymer. For the same reason, TEMED, the commonly used accelerator, was not used because it causes some hydrolysis of amide groups.43 A 10% w/w [monomer  crosslinker; Bis/(AAmBis) molar ratio: 1.5%] solution in doubly distilled water was prepared. Two milliliters of an APS initiator mother solution (4 g of APS in 100 g of H2O) were added per 100 g AAm-Bis solution. The reaction was carried out in 10-mL syringes, 15 mm in diameter, at 55 °C for 16 h. Following gelation, the gels were cooled, cut into 4-mm-thick cylindrical disks, and dialyzed exhaustively in doubly distilled water. The gels were then freeze-dried (48 h, 0.05 mbars) and kept in a desiccator over P2O5 for more than 2 weeks for complete dehydration.
Determination of the Relative Swelling Ratio of the Gels
Dry gel samples were weighed and immersed in different salt solutions and in water as a reference in tightly closed vials. The vials were equilibrated at 25  1 °C for 2 weeks (a nearly constant weight was reached after about 6 days). The volume of the gel samples was determined by gravimetric buoyancy measurement in water according to the Archimedes principle. The extent of swelling was described in terms of “specific volume,” which was defined as the equilibrium volume per initial dry weight of the gel. The “relative swelling
ratio” was defined as the specific volume in a salt solution divided by that in water.
Soluble PAAm Preparation
To control the molecular weight and minimize branching, PAAm was prepared according to the method described by Kulicke and Klein.44 AAm was dissolved (10% w/v) in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of doubly distilled water and methanol. This ratio was chosen on the basis of a calibration curve made in preliminary runs to achieve a molecular weight of 300 –500 kD. The solution was thermostated at 67 °C and deaerated by nitrogen bubbling for 40 min. About 0.4 g of a 30% H2O2 solution per 10 g AAm was then added as an initiator. After 80 more minutes of stirring and deaeration the solution was cooled to 4 °C. PAAm solution was exhaustively dialyzed against doubly distilled water with a 12-kD molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) dialysis tubing. This threshold was chosen to ensure that no fraction below the 10-kD MWCO of the osmotic pressure cell membrane remains because it would hinder osmotic pressure-determination precision. The dialyzed PAAm solution was freeze-dried and kept over P2O5 in a desiccator.
Determination of the Molecular Weight Distribution of the PAAm Synthesized
The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the PAAm synthesized were 237,000  3% and 301,200  2.2%, respectively, and the polydispersity was 1.271  0.047. Determination of molecular weight distribution was performed by online coupled size exclusion chromatography (SEC), a multi-angle laser light scattering photometer (MALLS), and a differential refractiveindex detector (DRI).45 The SEC system included three serial analytical SEC columns—PSS SUPREMA 10 /300 Å, 3000 Å & 10000 Å (Polymer Standards Service GmbH). The column packing was a macroporous crosslinked polymer gel, for separation of water-soluble polymers. The mobile phase, maintained at 25 °C, contained 0.1 M NaNO3, 0.02% NaN3 as a bactericide, and 10 mM of imidazol, pH 7.00. The MALLS detector (a Dawn DSP— digital signal processor—fitted with a K5 flow cell, from Wyatt Technology Inc., Santa Barbara, CA), the He–Ne laser light source, and the DRI detector (Optilab DSP), used as a mass sensitive detector, all operated at the same wavelength (633 nm).

(dn/dc) of polyacrylamide was taken as 0.182 mL/g.46
Solution Preparation
Salts were dried for 24 h at 110 °C in a vacuum oven (at 28.5 in. Hg vacuum) and kept in a desiccator over P2O5. All solutions were prepared with doubly distilled water to which 0.02% (w/w) sodium azide was added as a preservative. All components were analytically weighed and stirred overnight for complete dissolution. A PAAm mother solution (5% PAAm in H2O and azide) was prepared in doubly distilled water and then filtered with a Whatman #42 paper. Its precise concentration was determined gravimetrically by freeze-drying (48 h, 0.05 mbars). NaI solutions were prepared in preboiled water and kept under nitrogen atmosphere to prevent iodide oxidation.
Osmotic Pressure Measurement and Determination of the Salt Excess
These methods, including the experimental setup, have been described in detail in our previous publication.37 The salt excess () was calculated according to the following expression:
  CSin  CSout
Cp
 Is
Cp
(1)
where Cs stands for salt concentration, Cp is the polymer’s monomer concentration, and I is the imbalance, all in molal units. The subscript “in” designates inside the osmotic pressure cell on the polymer side of the membrane, whereas “out” designates the permeate side.
Intrinsic Viscosity Determination
Viscosity of dilute PAAm solutions with increasing polymer concentration was determined by a
0.5mm diameter  ̈Ubbelohde viscometer at 25  0.2 °C, with and without the presence of salts. The intrinsic viscosity, [] (dL/g), was calculated by plotting reduced viscosity [red  (  0)/0C] and inherent viscosity [inh  ln(/0)/C] (the subscript 0 refers to the respective polymer-free solution) as a function of the polymer concentration [C (g/dL)] and extrapolating both to zero polymer concentration. The average of these two intercepts was used as the estimate of the intrinsic viscosity.
Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry (ITC)
Salt-binding thermodynamics was examined with a MicroCal VP-ITC instrument by the following method:47–50 An aqueous PAAm solution was placed in the instrument’s 1.4-mL cell, and an aqueous salt solution was placed in the syringe. Two hundred eighty-five microliters of the salt solution were injected in 5-L injections with 180-s intervals. Two background runs were subtracted—salt solution into water and water into the polymer solution. MicroCal’s Origin software was used to analyze the results as follows. After blanks subtraction, the Origin’s “one-type-ofsites” model was fitted to the results, allowing free variation of all three parameters, and reiterating until a constant chi-squared value was reached.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 depicts the effects of salt type and concentration on the relative swelling ratio of PAAm gels. In Figure 1(a) the effect of the anion type is presented in a series of sodium halides (fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide). Gel swelling in NaF solutions is lower than in water, whereas in NaCl, NaBr, and NaI solutions it is enhanced in increasing order, respectively. In Figure 1(b), the effect of the cation type is shown with a series of alkali chlorides (lithium, sodium, potassium, and cesium). Both series of anions and cations show varying effects on the swelling of PAAm gels, according to the lyotropic or Hofmeister series ranking—sodium halide anions: F  (H2O)
 Cl  Br  I and alkali chlorides cations: (H2O)  Cs  K  Na  Li. The effect of the anion type is larger and apparent from very low concentrations. The effect of the cation type is smaller, and the graphs only diverge at concentrations above 1 molal. The larger effect of the anions is in line with many other findings of lyotropic phenomena21 and gel swelling in particular.26,27,29,39,51–53 Increasing concentrations of cesium and potassium chlorides cause an increasing relative swelling ratio at the lower concentrations, but the effect is reversed at higher concentrations. Possible reasons for this are discussed subsequently. Figure 2 portrays the effects of sodium salts on the intrinsic viscosity of soluble PAAm. The resemblance of Figures 2 and 1(a) highlights the analogy between macroscopic gel swelling and the

3). Such an analogy was also demonstrated by Shibayama and coworkers54,55 for ion-complexed poly(vinyl alcohol). Both gel swelling and intrinsic viscosity are usually indicative of the solvent quality for the polymer; therefore, the good correlation we have found between them may well have been expected. As we have previously37 shown with dextran gels, various salts affect gel swelling by altering
the osmotic pressure of the polymer. This pressure is the major driving force for gel swelling.56–59 In this context, by “osmotic pressure of the polymer,” we refer to the equilibrium pressure difference between a ternary (water-polymer-salt) solution and a respective binary (water-salt) solution across a membrane impermeable to the polymer only. Figure 3 depicts the osmotic pressure of PAAm in solutions containing the sodium salts at 0.75 molal concentration. Similar experiments were

performed at 0.05, 0.3, 1.75, and 4 molal salt concentrations. All measurements of the osmotic pressure (such as those presented in Fig. 3) lead to the conclusion that the various types of salts, at the examined concentrations, have no statistically significant influence on the scaling56 exponent n (eq 2)
 ACp
n (2)
where Cp is the polymer concentration (gram per milliliter). The average value of n was 2.3 (standard deviation: 0.1). This value is very close to the theoretical value of 2.25 for a semidilute linearpolymer solution in a good solvent.56,60 However, the effect of the salts on the pre-exponential factor, A, was significant. To quantify that, the results were again statistically analyzed, but this time with the value of n kept constant at 2.3. The value of the pre-exponential factor in water was termed “A0.” The value of A0 for PAAm in pure
water was 6370 kPa*(g/mL)2.3. The values of A/A0, as a function of salt type and concentration, are shown in Figure 4. This graph suggests that NaF, which is a salting-out salt, reduces the value of A/A0 as its concentration increases, whereas NaCl, NaBr, and NaI, being increasingly “salting-in” salts for PAAm, increase the value of A/A0 with their rising concentrations. Apparently, in the presence of
salts the value of A/A0 changes rather linearly as a function of the salt molal concentration. Figure 5 displays the magnitude of A/A0 as a function of the anionic (crystal) radius. It may be observed that in this homologic series of sodium halides where the anion radius varies while ionic charge and shape are constant, at a costant molal concentration A/A0 increases with ionic radius. Moreover, A/A0 increases more significantly with increasing concentration as the anion radius grows larger. However, below a certain radius, marked by the intersection of the equal concentration lines, the trend inverses, and for smaller anions, for example, fluoride, increased concentration decreases A/A0. Unfortunately, the limited solubility of NaF prevented observations at higher concentrations. The characteristic effect of the ionic radius seems to result from the interaction with water. This interaction apparently depends on both the radius of the anion and the dimensions and properties of the water dipole. According to Collins,19 small ions bind water molecules tightly as compared with the strength of interaction between two water molecules in the bulk, whereas large ions bind water molecules weakly. Consequently, the entropy of water around the ion is reduced in the former case and increased in the latter, as

seen in Figure 619 in which  SII, the difference between the entropy of water near an ion (cal/ °Kmol) and that of pure water, is plotted as a function of ionic crystal radius (Å). Positive values of SII (lower portion of the graph) indicate that water molecules near the ion are more mobile than bulk water and vice versa. The anions line crosses the S  0 axis at 1.71 Å and the cations line at 1.04 Å. Thus, a water dipole may be described as a virtual zwitterion whose anionic portion has a radius of R0a  1.71 Å, and its cationic portion(s), a radius R0c  1.04 Å. This radii difference obviously originates from the fact that the anionic portion is the oxygen atom, whose radius is larger than that of the hydrogens. On the basis of the data in Figures 4 and 5 and on the preceding literature information, we propose the following semiempirical model:
A  A0 1  kCsRan Ran  R0a)] (3)
This expression suggests that the effect of a salt on the osmotic pre-exponential factor in an aqueous solution depends on its molal concentration (Cs), its anionic (crystal) radius (Ran, Å), and on the difference between this radius and the apparent “anionic-portion radius” of the water molecule R0a. This radius marks a transition point of the anion radius effect. Ions whose radii are larger than R0a augment A/A0 as their concentrations increase, a trend that inverses below R0a. The value obtained for k was 0.357  0.019 mola11Å2. Because the cation and the polymer
were unchanged in this experiment, k is likely to depend on the properties of these two components. The R-square value for the model was 0.924, and the p value was 0.0001. The fit of the model (solid lines) to the experimental results (point markers) is presented in Figures 4 and 5. Another observation, which sheds some light on the mechanisms of salt effects on the osmotic pressure of the polymer, is the difference of salt concentration on opposite sides of the membrane, during the osmotic pressure measurements. This concentration imbalance is described in terms of salt excess () (eq 1). Figure 7 presents  (mol salt/mol monomer) as a function of salt molal concentration for the two extreme cases of sodium iodide (strong “salting-in”) and sodium fluoride (strong “salting-out”). The excess values observed for NaCl and NaBr were not significantly different from zero. NaI exhibited a positive excess, whereas NaF showed the opposite. Moreover, the sorption isotherm shape of the NaI curve suggests an adsorption of the salt onto the polymer, similar to that for NaSCN on dextran shown previously.37 To verify whether indeed there is binding of the NaI on the polymer, we have used ITC, which has hardly been used for this type of system. By titrating a 3 g/100 g PAAm solution (monomer concentration 415 mM) with a one molal (946 mM) NaI solution, a good fit was obtained for a singletype-of-binding-sites model. This model assumes all binding sites are identical and independent. This yielded a binding constant Kb  9.7  2.0

M1, a binding enthalpy H0  103.9  7.3 kCal/mol bound NaI, a binding entropy S0  4.17 kCal/molK, and a saturation ratio of 0.53  0.01 mol NaI per mole acrylamide monomer (Fig. 8). In contrast, the results with NaF show very small absolute values of heat of interaction and do not fit a binding model. This implies that there is no significant attractive interaction between NaF and PAAm. These results, indicative of a weak binding of NaI, agree with the literature data obtained by other methods. Von Hippel et al.,24 with recycling chromatography on PAAm gel columns, found a relative binding constant of NaI to PAAm (with respect to binding of tritiated water) of 5.6  102M1 at 25 °C. These researchers have shown that the binding is entirely to the amide moiety. Oh et al.33 found an intrinsic binding constant of 1.3 M1 for iodide on PAAm by interpreting 127I NMR excess line widths. They explained the binding as resulting from the attractive force between the polarizable iodide and the polymer’s dipoles. The most likely binding site is the amide nitrogen, which carries a partially positive charge because of a balance between two resonant states,23

An adsorption of the salt onto the polymer may also explain the leveling-off of the relative swell
ing ratio curve [Fig. 1(a)] at high NaI concentrations as saturation of the polymer’s ion-binding capacity is approached. Moreover, such a preferential adsorption may explain the increased osmotic pressure of the polymer by the following mechanism (Fig. 9). Zones of excess salt concentration30 form around the polymer segments. The reduced chemical potential of the water, in overlapping excess zones of adjacent polymer chains, creates a waterchemical potential gradient that serves as a driving force for water diffusion into these overlap zones. Consequently, the polymer chains are pushed apart. As opposed to NaI, NaF shows a negative excess or preferential repulsion from the polymer. This agrees with the negative relative binding constant of NaF and PAAm (2.8  102M1 at 25 °C) found by von Hippel et al.24 The reduced osmotic pressure may also be explained by the formation of salt-depleted zones around the polymer segments because of the strongly bound water “shell” around the anion. When polymer segments approach one another and their salt-depleted zones overlap, the reduced salt concentration between the chains increases the chemical potential of the water as compared with that of water in the bulk. This water-chemical potential gradient serves as a driving force for diffusion of water away from the overlap zone between the polymer segments, which are consequently pulled closer together. This may explain both the shrinking of the gel and the reduced intrinsic viscosity in presence of NaF and other salting-out salts. On the basis of the literature and the results of this work, the following mechanisms may explain

the impact of the various ions on the swelling of the gels and the increased intrinsic viscosity and osmotic pressure of the soluble polymer. The origin of the differences between effects of various ions can be related to their charge density,19–22 which affects their interaction with water molecules as well as with the hydrophilic sites of the polymer. The higher the charge density, the stronger the attraction between the ion and the adjacent water molecules. The dynamic liquid tetrahedral structure of water63 is greatly modified by the presence of the various ions.22 Figure 10 is a schematic (two-dimensional) representation of the rearrangement of water molecules around the various types of ions, as interpreted from several sources.22,29,64
Small, high-charge density anions, like F, bind their adjacent water molecules strongly and coordinate them radially, with one hydrogen pointing inward and the other outward [Fig. 10(a)]. Large, low-charge density anions, like I [Fig. 10(b)], are weakly hydrated because bulk water–water bonds are energetically more favorable then hydration of the anion. Additionally, their large size and electrostatic field interfere with formation of tetrahedral water structure in their vicinity. Small, high-charge density cations,
for example, Li, bind water molecules strongly but coordinate them with the oxygen toward the cation and the two hydrogens pointing outward [Fig. 10(c)]. Finally, the large, low-charge density cations, for example, Cs, like the large anions, interfere with water structure and do not create an alternative radial structure [Fig. 10(d)]. Figure 11 summarizes the interactions of the four types of ions with water and the polymer. The repulsion of the fluoride ion may be explained through the strong binding of the surrounding water molecules, which prevents the anion from approaching the first hydration layer of the polymer. This strong hydration complex acts as a poorer solvent for the polymer because of two main reasons. Entropically, the larger size of the complex as compared with a single water molecule reduces the number of degrees of freedom upon mixing with the polymer. Enthalpically, the radial coordination of the water molecules around the anion by its strong negative electric field causes a partial rejection of the electron clouds of the water molecules toward the outward pointing hydrogens [Fig. 10(a)]. Consequently, their electron-pair acceptance (EPA)65 ability is decreased; therefore, their ability to form hydrogen bonds with the lone electron pairs of the amide oxygen is diminished.4,26–29 The counterions are most likely also rather strongly attracted to the anion (more strongly as their radius decreases19); therefore, they apparently do not play an important role in this case. Large, low-charge density anions [Fig. 11(b)], like iodide, increase the osmotic pressure and demonstrate a positive excess because they are “pushed” toward the polymer by the water molecules, which energetically favor the formation of bulk water structures over hydration of both the anion and the polymer.19,20 These anions apparently adsorb to the positive sites of the polymer dipoles, as described above. The increased osmotic pressure of the polymer in solutions of NaI or NaSCN may be explained by a reduced free energy of mixing because of both the attractive interaction of the anions with the polymer and the high combinatorial entropy of their counterions, which are not strongly bound to the anion. Both effects make their solutions better solvents for the polymer. The increased swelling ratio of hydrophilic gels in the presence of high-charge density cations [Fig. 11(c)], such as Li, was explained4,26–29 by an increased EPA of their strongly coordinated water molecules. The outward pointing hydro

gens of the coordinated water molecules are more positive than in bulk water because of the attraction of their electron clouds by the cation. Therefore, they are more prone to form hydrogen bonds with the electron pairs of the polymer’s dipolar groups, namely, those of the amide oxygen, in the case of PAAm. However, the reduced mixing entropy due to the size of the hydration complex makes this hydrated complex an entropically poorer cosolvent. The concentration-dependent effect of potassium and cesium on the swelling of PAAm gels [Fig. 1(b)] deserves attention. The increased swelling at the lower salt concentrations is likely to be the effect of the chloride anion. However, at large concentrations another factor seems to dominate. Possibly, the hydration of the amide groups is more favorable then the binding of these cations [Fig. 11(d)]. Consequently, at high concentrations they act as somewhat worse cosolvents and cause a reduction of the gel volume. The larger difference between anion and cation effects on gel swelling may be explained by the following concept: Small anions form hydration complexes that are poor cosolvents both enthalpically and entropically, whereas large anions act as good cosolvents both enthalpically and entropically. In contrast, small cations form hydration complexes that are good cosolvents enthalpically
but are entropically poor, whereas large cations are neither very good nor very poor enthalpically or entropically. Further studies are needed to validate these suggested mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS
The swelling of PAAm gels increased according to the following ranking of the lyotropic series of anions of sodium halides: F  (H2O)  Cl
 Br  I and that of the cations of alkali chlorides: (H2O)  Cs  K  Na  Li. The effect of cation type was much smaller and only apparent at higher salt concentrations. A good correlation exists between the swelling ratio of the gels and the molecular conformation expansion of the linear polymer, evident from the intrinsic viscosity measurements in various salt solutions. The effects of salt type and concentration on gel swelling correlated well with the effect on the osmotic pressure of the polymer in the respective solutions, which is the main driving force for gel swelling. The scaling theory (eq 2) described the osmotic pressure of PAAm in the examined salt solutions and in water. The scaling exponent was practically independent of anion radius or concentration, and its value (2.3  0.1) was in accord with the theoretical value of 2.25 for a

semidilute linear polymer solution in a good solvent. A semiempirical model was developed (eq 3) that well describes the dependence of the preexponential factor, A, on salt concentration and anion radius in a series of alkali halides. The effects of the anions on the osmotic pressure of PAAm may be explained through their preferential interactions with the polymer. A strong salting-in anion, like iodide, appears to preferentially adsorb onto the polymer, whereas a strong salting-out anion, such as fluoride, is preferentially repulsed. This is evident from the salt excess observed during the osmotic pressure experiments and from the isothermal titration calorimetric results. Osmotic pressure and salt excess measurements supply useful criteria for investigating preferential interactions of polymers and low-molecular-weight cosolutes, especially for very hydrophilic polymers that do not exhibit phase transitions at experimentally accessible temperatures.
