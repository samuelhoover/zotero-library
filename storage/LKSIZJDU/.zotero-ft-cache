A recent thermodynamic perturbation theory for flexible polyelectrolyte solutions is extended to study thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria for polyelectrolyte solutions with different polyion chain lengths. Osmotic pressure, activity coefficient of an individual ion (polyion or counterion) and average activity coefficient are calculated. Except for the activity coefficient of the polyion, the chain length dependence of the properties is small. Also presented are vapour-liquid equilibrium coexisting curves, vapour pressures and critical points. As the polyion chain length approaches infinity the critical properties (temperature, pressure and density) become constants.

1. Introduction A molecular thermodynamic model for flexible polyelectrolyte solutions has been developed recently by Jiang et al. [ l , 21. The polyelectrolyte is represented by a linear freely jointed tangent charged hard sphere chain with the corresponding counterions embedded in a continuum dielectric medium. The chain connectivity between r segments on the polyion is taken into account through the r-particle cavity correlation function (CCF), which is evaluated by a linear approximation of nearestneighbour two-particle CCFs [3]. On the basis of the mean-spherical approximation (MSA) for electrolyte solutions [ M I , analytical expressions for the thermodynamic properties can be obtained. Applying this model, we studied the density dependence of the osmotic pressure for different polyelectrolyte solutions. The effects of polyion chain length, counterion size, counterion charge and dielectric constant on the osmotic pressure were investigated extensively. We found that there are two scaling regimes through a crossover density for the osmotic pressure. Good agreement was found upon comparison with those from computer simulation [7],

a scaling approach [S] and experiment [9]. The results imply that a polyion chain would rather adopt an expanded random shape than a rodlike conformation. This may be attributed to the attraction between polyion monomers and counterions that potentially can overwhelm the repulsion between the monomers.
The model was developed originally using Wertheim’s thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT) [101. TPT provides a quick route to evaluate the thermodynamic properties and has been used widely to study the thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria of associating fluids. Alternatively, Wertheim’s OrnsteinZernike (WOZ) approach [lo] can be used to study both thermodynamic and structure properties of associating fluids, however, at the cost of solving integral equations. Based on the binding MSA (BIMSA) [ l l , 121, Blum and coworkers [13-1 71 gave the general analytical solution for flexible polyelectrolyte solutions. As in the ionic solution case, the thermodynamic and structural properties are functions of a unique scaling parameter. The polymer BIMSA (PBIMSA) satisfies the exact Debye-Huckel low-density limiting law for any flexible polymer chain. It has been shown also that all of the MSA-like theories can be derived from a variational principle for the Helmholtz free energy [18].

von Solms and Chiew [19, 201 also applied the WOZ approach to study polyelectrolyte solutions: both thermodynamic and structural properties were calculated. Their analytical solution is identical to that of [14].
It is worthwhile to note that there are some other approaches to the study of polyelectrolyte solutions, such as counterion condensation theory [21], modified Poisson-Boltzmann formalism [22] and the polymerreference-interaction-sitemodel (PRISM) [23-251.
For practical applications, it is of great interest to know the phase behaviour of polyelectrolyte solutions and polyelectrolytes with colloidal particles or biomolecules [26]. In this work, we extend the previous theory to study phase behaviour in polyelectrolyte solutions. The effects of polyion chain length on thermodynamic properties, phase equilibria and critical points are investigated.

2. Theory The flexible polyion is represented by a linear freely jointed tangent charged hard sphere chain with chain length r, monomer number density p,, hard core diameter amand charge Z,e (e is elementry charge). The

corresponding counterion has number density pc, diameter a, and charge Zce. Simultaneously, we define the molecule (chain) number density p: (obviously, for the polyion p; = p m / r ; for the counterion, p: = pc). All particles are embedded in a continuous dielectric

medium with permittivity E (E = E ~ E E~~ , is permittivity of the vacuum and E, is the dielectric constant). The interaction between the non-bonded particles i-j is the electrostatic interaction

where R is the centrexentre distance, with nu=

For this system, the Helmholtz energy density f , i.e. the Helmholtz energy per unit volume V , is attributed to four contributions from, respectively, ideal-gas mixing, hard sphere repulsion, electrostatic interaction and chain connectivity.

The hard sphere contribution is calculated from the BMCSL equation given by Boublik, Mansoori and coworkers [27]:

The contribution from electrostatic interaction is obtained by the MSA [MI,
where tB= pe2/4n&is the Bjerrum length characterizing
the dielectricproperty of the continuum. The key feature of the MSA is that it can be solved analytically with a
unique scaling parameter r,which can be estimated by a
simple iterative procedure using the following equations:

For a system with equal size ions, P, = 0 due to electroneutrality. For infinite dilute solution, the scaling diameter 2 r , also called electrostatic inverse screening length, will reach the limit, i.e. Debye’s inverse screening length r;D = (4n:~Bc p k z : ) ’ / 2 .
The contribution from chain connectivity between segments along a polyion is evaluated from the effective nearest-neighbour two-particle CCF yij(oij)of the nonassociating fluid,

According to the definition of the CCF, however, y i j ( a i j ) may be estimated from
It has been recognized that grSA(aij)given by the MSA is not very accurate for high coupling and low density; in some cases, negative values may appear, and these have no physical meaning. There are several methods to improve this deficiency, and a simple one is the EXP approximation [28-311 as follows:
where $(aij) is the pair correlation function for hard sphere at contact, given by

The EXP gives better structural properties than the MSA, and has been applied widely for the LennardJones (LJ) fluid [29, 32, 331, the Yukawa fluid [34, 351 and electrolyte solutions [29, 30, 361. One example in figure 1 shows gii(aij) calculated, respectively, from EXP, MSA and 'exact' Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of Card and Valleau [37] for a 1:l electrolyte solution. The upper part is for unlike ions. Large deviations between MSA and MC are found in the available concentration range. The MSA underestimates gii(aij);how-

ever, the EXP gives good results with small overestimation in the intermediate range. For like ions as shown in the lower part, the MSA gives negative values without physical meaning at low concentrations (<0.3 moll-') but yields good values at high concentrations. By contrast, the EXP gives satisfactory results across the whole range by comparison with MC.

(16)
On the other hand, combining equations (9) and (1 1) we can easily arrive at equation (16). This means that the EXP method can be viewed as the HNC/MSA. Throughout this work we use equation (9) to perform the calculations.
It should be remarked that the BIMSA-EXP approximation work [12] uses the same form of the cavity correlation function. At any rate the BIMSA-EXP also yields the correct Debye limit and the dimer is a (+-) dimer because then one gets zero for the effective charge for the dimer case [12]. This is also the one that yields the best agreement with computation for the famous Coulomb equilibrium problem. Both the current approach and the BIMSA-EXP go to the same highdensity limit, which is that of free particles. Neither satisfies the exact limit, however, which is that of the high-density polyelectrolyte.

ever, its crossover density is independent of the chain

length. This is because the osmotic pressure is determined mainly by counterion density that is independent of polyion chain length.
Figure 3 shows the density pma3dependence of the polyion activity coefficient 7, for polyelectrolyte solutions with different chain lengths r = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 00. At infinite low-density limit, 7, 41 as expected for ideal mixture. At low and intermediate
densities, 7, < 1. This reveals that the attractive inter-
action overwhelms the repulsive. Given a certain den-

sity, yp decreases as the chain length increases, especially, for long chains. The density influence is much stronger for long chains. For each chain length there is a minimum point where attraction reaches a maximum. Beyond a crossover density ln(pma3)= 1.329, where lny, is equal to -0.847 and is independent of chain length, yp increases drastically due to strong hard sphere repulsion at high packing fractions, again especially for long chains.

The binodal curve becomes steep with increase in chain length, especially the liquid phase. The difference between the binodal curves for short chains is large; however, for long chains the difference is small. Eventually, the binodal curve remains unchanged for very large chains. For

the RPM, many Monte Carlo (MC) simulation studies

have been reported on vapour-liquid phase equilibrium

and critical point [38-44]. The open circles (coexisting

phases) and the triangle (critical point) are from [40].

from MC [40], TzP= 0.0490,

We can see that the

MSA gives qualitative VLE coexistence curve upon

comparison with MC simulation, but it overestimates

the critical temperature and underestimates the critical

density. Several revised models have been proposed

towards a more accurate description [36, 45-49]. Based

on the BIMSA-EXP [12], we found that T:p = 0.0627

and pEp = 0.0471 [49], in close agreement with

Kalyuzhnyi [48], which for the time being is one of the

closest to the simulation.

Clapeyron plot. At a given temperature T*,the vapour

pressure P' decreases with increase of chain length.

Similar to coexistence curves, for short chains the differ-

ence in vapour pressure is large; however, the difference

is small for long chains. Eventually, it remains constant

for very large chains. For the RPM, we show the MC

data from [40]. Large deviations between the MSA and

MC are found.

Figure 8 shows the critical properties as a function of

chain length r. As r increases, the critical temperature

Tzp increases quickly for short chains and reaches a

constant value of 0.245 when r is beyond lo2. Similar

There is almost no change in the binodal curve when the chain length is longer than lo2.The critical temperature and pressure increase monotonically with increase in chain length; critical density, however, first decreases and then increases. Finally, when chain length is beyond lo2, they all approach a constant value.

For the critical density dif-

Finally, it reaches a constant value of 0.0126. Unlike T&

and Pzp, the chain length dependence of pzp is weak.

4. Conclusion On the basis of a thermodynamic perturbation theory for polyelectrolyte solutions, we have investigated the density dependence of the osmotic pressure, the activity coefficient of the polyion or counterion and the average activity coefficient for the polyelectrolyte, on polyion chain length. The influence of the chain length on the activity coefficient of a polyion is very large; in contrast, for the other three properties, the influence is small, especially for long chains. The most important observation is that there are two scaling relations between the osmotic pressure and the density in the two regimes, separated by a crossover density. The scaling indices and the crossover density are independent of the polyion chain length. The results imply that the polyion chain is fully screened by the oppositely charged counterions at high densities. We also investigated the vapour-liquid equilibria and critical points for polyelectrolytes with different polyion chain lengths. Increasing the chain length leads to a steep binodal curve, especially for the liquid branch.
