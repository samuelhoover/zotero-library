The formation and precise manipulation of nanoscale features by controlling macroscopic forces is essential to advancing nanotechnology. Toward this end, we report here a theoretical study on formation of nanowires with precisely controlled widths, starting from single-layer conducting islands on crystalline conducting substrates under the controlled action of macroscopic forcing provided by an externally applied electric field that drives island edge electromigration. Numerical simulations based on an experimentally validated model and supported by linear stability theory show that large-size islands undergo a current-induced fingering instability, leading to nanowire formation after finger growth. Depending on the substrate surface crystallographic orientation, necking instabilities after fingering lead to the formation of multiple parallel nanowires per island. In all cases, the axis of the formed nanowires is aligned with the direction of the externally applied electric field. The nanowires have constant widths, on the order of 10 nm, which can be tuned by controlling the externally applied electric field strength. Our findings have important implications for developing future lithography-free nanofabrication and nanoelectronic patterning techniques. Published by AIP Publishing.

The ability to form and manipulate nanoscale features by controlling macroscopic forces is essential to advancing nanotechnology. For example, externally applied fields, such as electric fields and thermal gradients, can be used to drive atomic motion through the mass transport phenomena of electromigration1‚Äì4 or thermomigration5,6 providing paradigm shifts in surface engineering and nanofabrication based on physical patterning. This concept of external-force-driven nanostructure control has been tested successfully on diverse material systems ranging from metal conductors2 to colloids7 and block copolymers.8,9 Here, we examine the feasibility of this concept toward formation of nanowires, high-aspect ratio material structures confined to nanoscopic length scales in all but one dimension, which are particularly appealing for a broad range of applications,10 from electronic and photonic technologies11‚Äì14 to biological applications15 and energy technologies, such as photovoltaics, batteries, and artificial photosynthesis.16‚Äì18 A recent experimental study based on in situ scanning tunneling microscopy2 has demonstrated the ability to control the dynamics of single-layer islands of a few thousand metal atoms grown by a two-step thermal deposition method on crystalline substrates of the same metal through currentinduced displacements mediated by surface electromigration. The islands migrate along the electric field direction with constant velocities that are inversely proportional to the

p .2 Theoretical studies19‚Äì21 have found periphery or edge diffusion to be the dominant mode of mass transport in such islands, and continuum-domain as well as atomistic simulation studies22‚Äì25 have demonstrated
complex current-driven nonlinear island dynamics, from oscillatory to chaotic, for islands exceeding a critical size Rc.22 The purpose of this letter is to report a strategy for nanowire formation on crystalline substrate surfaces, with the nanowire geometry tuned by controlling purely macroscopic forcing parameters. We focus on formation of single-layer nanowires of conducting materials on surfaces of crystalline conducting substrates with the macroscopic forcing provided by an externally applied electric field. Starting from stable rounded islands, the equilibrium configuration of single-layer epitaxial islands in the absence of external forcing, and using stability analysis and numerical simulations, we show that, for islands larger than a critical size, proper control of the direction and magnitude of the applied field triggers a currentinduced fingering instability that transforms the island into a stable nanowire configuration. Depending on the substrate orientation and for larger island sizes, we find that necking instabilities following finger growth facilitate the formation of arrays of parallel nanowires from a single original island. In all cases, the nanowires are confined in one dimension with their width controlled precisely by controlling the applied field strength. We demonstrate this strategy as a potential technique for lithography-free nanofabrication and physical patterning of surfaces at dimensions barely accessible even by e-beam lithography, using Ag islands on Ag substrates as a benchmark system for which our model has been validated experimentally.2,22 Achieving parallel arrays of 10-nm-wide nanowires and demonstrating the ability to control their direction could have important implications for developing future nanoelectronic patterning techniques applicable, e.g., to the interconnect structures of future electronic chips.

This local approximation for the electric field is justified by the fact that the single-layer island, i.e., one-monolayer-thick island, is practically a two-dimensional feature on the metallic surface. Consequently, the island has a negligible effect on the electric field distribution around its edge and there is no need to consider any nonlocal phenomena, such as current crowding, in the model.23 We account for edge diffusional anisotropy, Ds√∞h√û 1‚ÅÑ4 Ds;maxf √∞h√û, the strongest and most important anisotropy in the material system of interest through the anisotropy function f √∞h√û 1‚ÅÑ4 f1 √æ A cos21‚ÅÑ2m√∞h √æ /√û¬äg=√∞1 √æ A√û  1 for fcc crystals; A > 0 is the anisotropy strength, / is the misorientation angle formed between the fastest edge diffusion direction and the direction of the externally applied field, and m is an integer parameter that expresses symmetry due to crystallographic orientation and sets the number of fast diffusion directions; m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, 2, and 3 for {110}, {100}, and {111} substrate surfaces, respectively.22,23 The model, Eq.

To analyze the morphological stability of the currentdriven island, we use linear stability theory (LST).26,27 We perturb the perfectly circular island shape, the equilibrium morphology of a single-layer island with isotropic ~c,22 as

Rc 1‚ÅÑ4 √∞pr2
0;c√û1=2, one or more eigenmodes of the linearized problem become unstable (the corresponding eigenvalues have positive real parts) leading to morphological instabilities. Rc is strongly dependent on the diffusional anisotropy parameters m and /. In conjunction with the LST, we also use direct dynamical simulations to study the current-driven island morphological stability and verify the predictions of the LST. In the simulations, we employ a well-tested front tracking method22,29 and handle island breakup with the procedure described in Ref. 30. Here, we use material properties characteristic of Ag islands on Ag substrates, yielding lE 1‚ÅÑ4 13.55 nm and s 1‚ÅÑ4 32.5 s,22 and focus on a misorientation angle such that the applied electric field is aligned with the slowest edge diffusion direction: / 1‚ÅÑ4 p=√∞2m√û, i.e., for {110}, {100}, and {111} substrates, / 1‚ÅÑ4 90; 45, and 30, respectively. For these substrate surface orientations, m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, 2, and 3, respectively, both the LST and the numerical simulations predict, in perfect agreement, critical sizes for loss of stability of the rounded island morphology of r0;c 1‚ÅÑ4 3:44lE; 1:43lE, and 1:45lE, respectively. The linear stability analysis provides important physical insights into the island shapes that emerge beyond the onset of morphological instability. For m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, the island evolves from an initial perturbed rounded shape to a distorted elliptical shape with a single protrusion forming at the leading end of the island (Fig. S1(a4) of Ref. 28). With increasing island size, the qualitative nature of the island morphological evolution, such as the number of protrusions emanating from the island edge, does not change. Results of numerical simulations for the same anisotropy parameters and island sizes agree qualitatively with the LST prediction. Simulation according to the fully nonlinear model (Fig. 2) shows that the morphology of a large-size island evolves from close to a rounded initial morphology to an asymptotically stable

nanowire configuration with very high aspect ratio, L/w  40, where L and w are the nanowire length and width, respectively; the nanowire axis is always aligned with the direction of the electric field E0. For m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, increasing the island size leads to an increase in the nanowire aspect ratio but the overall dynamical response remains qualitatively the same. It should be mentioned that for m 1‚ÅÑ4 1 and / 61‚ÅÑ4 90, a necking instability for island sizes larger than a critical value leads to island breakup into daughter islands;22 the special alignment of the externally applied field examined here, / 1‚ÅÑ4 90, inhibits the necking instability and enables stable nanowire formation. Results from simulations of current-driven island morphological evolution on {100} substrate surfaces, m 1‚ÅÑ4 2, are shown in Fig. 3. Three distinct stages in the island evolution are observed. During the initial stage of evolution, over a time period on the order of 10 s, multiple protrusions are formed on the island edge (due to the growth of unstable modes) and are arranged symmetrically with respect to the direction of E0 (x-axis); during this period, the simulation results are qualitatively consistent with the LST predictions, with direct comparisons provided in Ref. 28. During the next stage, over a longer time period on the order of 100 s, only
those protrusions that correspond to the dominant unstable modes grow further and facilitate a fingering instability. Finally, finger growth forms narrow necks at the back (trailing) end of the island, triggering a necking instability and causing island breakup, thus leading into an asymptotic morphologically stable state consisting of an array of parallel nanowires arranged symmetrically with respect to the direction of E0. For example, during the evolution of the island of
size R 1‚ÅÑ4 18pffipffiffi lE (Fig. 3(c)), at t 1‚ÅÑ4 24 s, four pronounced protrusions are observed at the island‚Äôs leading end; as the edge shape evolution proceeds, two of these protrusions merge to form one finger, generating a total of three fingers, which leads, upon necking and breakup, to an asymptotic state of three parallel nanowires with their axes aligned with E0 (Fig. 3(c5)). It should be emphasized that in the asymptotic states reached by the simulations, in the evolution sequences of Figs. 2 and 3, the stable nanowires translate under the action of the electric field along x at constant speed for given nanowire size in a manner similar with the smallersize asymptotic island states of Ref. 22. The current-driven island evolution on {111} substrate surfaces, m 1‚ÅÑ4 3, is generally similar to that on {100} substrates and presented in detail in Fig. S6 of Ref. 28. However, contrary to nanowire formation on surfaces with m 1‚ÅÑ4 2, for surfaces with m 1‚ÅÑ4 3 only an odd number, N, of nanowires (except for the case N 1‚ÅÑ4 2) is formed at the asymptotic state as the island size R is varied at / 1‚ÅÑ4 p=√∞2m√û.28 For the special case of N 1‚ÅÑ4 2, the individual island breaks up asymmetrically with respect to the horizontal axis (E0 direction); no other even value of N is observed in the simulation study. All of these asymptotic states, nanowires or nanowire arrays at m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, 2, or 3, R > Rc, and / 1‚ÅÑ4 p=√∞2m√û, are stable only under the application of an electric field; upon turning off the current, the thermodynamically stable rounded morphology is reached asymptotically after a long time on the order of 105 s. From an experimental point of view, these stable nanowires can be immobilized by turning off the current and reducing the temperature sufficiently to markedly slow down edge atom diffusion. From the simulation results on current-driven island evolution of Figs. 3 and S6 of Ref. 28, it is evident that the number of fingers emanating from the island edge at the intermediate stage of evolution increases with increasing individual island size R and so does the total number of formed nanowires, N. Also, as N increases, the distance between any two adjacent nanowires in an array of nanowires becomes more uniform. The results of a comprehensive simulation study for the dependence of the number of nanowires formed at the asymptotic state on the island size are summarized in the response diagram of Fig. 4. From the results of Fig. 4, the range of individual island sizes corresponding to a given number N as well as the critical island sizes required for transition between asymptotic states of nanowire arrays with different numbers of nanowires are identified. The stable nanowire morphology at the asymptotic states reached by the simulations of Figs. 2, 3, and S6 of Ref. 28 are characterized by confinement in one dimension. The resulting constant nanowire widths, determined as detailed in Ref. 28, are 2:58lE; 2:21lE, and 2:12lE for {110}, {100}, and {111} substrate surfaces, respectively. The width, w, of the

In summary, we demonstrated a strategy for forming precisely controlled confined nanowire features on conducting substrate surfaces, emerging as surface patterns triggered by morphological instabilities driven by an externally applied electric field and using the Ag/Ag system as an example. This strategy can be considered as a physical nanopatterning technique involving the control of macroscopic forces, such as electric or magnetic fields, light, and temperature gradients, acting on well characterized surfaces. Our analytical and simulation studies can be used to design
experimental protocols for such surface patterning and can be extended to various other material systems, including metals, semiconductors, graphene,31 and 2D materials, as well as polymers,32 opening up exciting physical patterning possibilities toward nanofabrication technologies.
