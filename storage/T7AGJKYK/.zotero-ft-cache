Résumé. 2014 Le comportement d’une chaine flexible unique, près de la température 0398 de Flory, est analysé à partir d’une analogie avec un problème magnétique. La transition vers un état globulaire compact est relié aux propriétés d’un point tricritique dans le problème magnétique.
Abstract. 2014 The behavior of a single, flexible polymer chain near the Flory temperature 0398 is analysed in analogy with a magnetic phase transition. The transition to a collapsed state is related to a tricritical point for the magnetic problem.
A solute polymer chain expands in a good solvent, and collapses in a poor solvent [1]. By suitable changes in temperature, or in solvent composition, it is possible to cross over from one behavior to the
other. In experiments on solutions, a demixing process replaces the collapse [1]. However, the transition from an extended shape to a globular form, for a single coil, may be of some interest for studies on protein folding [2] ; it is also of theoretical interest as a first step towards the understanding of micellar
structures. The collapse has been studied by numerical methods on lattice models, where the polymer chain is described as a self avoiding walk, and attractive interac
tions between neighboring monomers are added :
the results have been reinterpreted recently by Domb [3]. In the present note, we present a slightly different approach, based on an analogy with the
phase transitions of a magnetic system, which is already known to be useful for the simple excluded
volume problem [4].
1. Self consistent field approximation. - As usual,
it is helpful to start by a simple calculation of the
Flory type [1] suitably extended to cover collapsed situations. This is based on the following free energy
Here a = R/Ro is the expansion factor, and
Ro = N 1/2a
is the r.m.s. radius of an ideal coil. N is the number
of monomers along the chain. The average monomer
concentration in the coil is
p = kN/R d = ka - d N’ - ~l2 (2)
where d is the dimensionality and k a numerical
constant. The parameters Wl, W2, ... are essentially the successive virial coefficients of the monomer interaction. Wt (T) is the excluded volume coefficient and has the form
Here e is the Flory compensation temperature.
(To be specific we assume v &#x3E; 0.) The second coeffi
cient W2 may be taken as positive and temperature independent in the range of interest. It is important to realise that both WI and W2 are relevant for a discussion of the region T= 0 in three space dimensions. For T N e, a ~ 1 and the W2 term is of order N 3 -d : this is to be compared with the extensional term 2 a2 - In a which is of order unity. Thus W2 is relevant for d 3. The higher terms
( W3, W4, ...) are irrelevant for d = 3.
Specializing now to d = 3, retaining only WI and W2 in eq. (1) inserting the form (2) for p, and minimizing the free energy, one arrives at the follow
ing amended form of the Flory equation [1] :
where y = k2 WZ a- ~ is a dimensionless parameter. [Physically, y can be increased by adding side groups to the chain; it can be decreased by choosing chains
which are somewhat rigid.] A plot of a(x) for various

values of y is shown on figure 1. For good solvents (x &#x3E; 1) the Flory curve is maintained and R ~ N3/5.
For poor solvents (x 0) we have a strong collapse and
FIG. 1. - Size of a polymer chain as a function of reduced temperature in an extended Flory approximation (eq. (4)). The curves are shown for various values of a parameter y, which is large if the chain has some side groups, and small if the chain is slightly stiff.
ForI x 1 (crossover region) we find two regimes
depending on the value of the constant y. If y &#x3E; 0.038
the coil contracts smoothly upon cooling. But if y 0.038 eq. (4) predicts an unstable branch; if this were taken literally, it would imply an abrupt transition to the collapsed state, at a certain critical value of x for which the free energies on the two (locally) stable branches become equal. In fact, since we are dealing with a finite system, the sharp transition may be an artefact of the self consistent field method : but it is probably indicative of a very
steep slope, as is indeed confirmed by numerical experiments [3]. The main weakness of the latter
is that they are usually performed at one single value of y, depending on the particular model chosen. A more elaborate (local) version of this self consistent field method has been considered by Edwards [5]
(without the W2 term) and by Lifschitz [6] (with a saturation term); the Lifschitz results are very similar to those deduced from eq. (4).
2. Relation between collapse and a tricritical point. The interaction terms in eq. (1) can be used as a
starting point for a rigorous theory of chain conformations, just as the Landau free energy FL [7] can be used as a weight function for calculations on critical
points [8]. Let us consider in fact a magnetic system with magnetisation M, temperature T and Landau
free energy :
[Where r 0 ’" (z - 1: 0)’ To being the mean field transition point.]
There is a correspondence between the diagrams for the correlation function M(O) M(r) &#x3E; of the
magnetic problem (in zero field, and above the transition point, T &#x3E; rj and the statistical weight for a
chain extending from 0 to r [4]. The bare vertex
coefficients Ul, U2, ... are essentially identical (apartI from normalization coefficients) to the virial coef
ficients ~, W2 ... The polymer length N is related to T by a Laplace transform, but from dimensional considerations on a single chain it suffices to say that N - (r 2013 1:c)-l. We are interested here in the
limit N -+ oo (r -+ 1:c).
The diagrams for the two problems coincide provided that certain closed loops, present in the
magnetic case but absent for the single chain, are eliminated : this is achieved formally by setting the
number n of components of the vector M equal to
zero [4]. The standard excluded volume problem corres
ponds to a strongly positive Wl (or Ul) : in this regime U2, U3,... are irrelevant. The problem discussed here corresponds to WI small : i.e. to a tri
critical point [8]. An assumption of generalised scaling then leads to a coil radius (or correlation length) of the form
Here 17V, is defined as in eq. (3), but with a shifted 0
point : 0 = 0~1 - g(y) ~V’~].
vt is a tricritical exponent defined as in reference [8].
The constant Ot is a cross-over exponent. For
!~!~1
the function f remains finite and R - Nvt. For
x &#x3E; 1, f becomes independent of y and proportional to a power of x ; then R - Nv where v is the excluded
volume exponent. For x - 1, f is strongly depen
dent on y and again behaves like a power ofI x I:
Eq. (1) suggests that the exponent Vc in the collapsed state is equal to 1/~ : for fixed (negative) WI the density p is finite and the interaction terms (of order N)

dominate the free energy : the extensional term (of order 1) can be omitted. This conclusion for Vc
is probably valid even beyond the self consistent
field approximation.
For d = 3 the tricritical exponents have the mean
field values vt = qJt = t. However, this is a marginal case (confluence of two fixed points in the renormali
sation group approach) and corrections involving (In N) are expected [9]. For d = 2 an approximate value of vt may be extracted from the results of an
