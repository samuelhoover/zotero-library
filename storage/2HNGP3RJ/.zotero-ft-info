Title:          Theory of Charged Gels: Swelling, Elasticity, and Dynamics
Subject:        The fundamental attributes of charged hydrogels containing predominantly water and controllable amounts of low molar mass electrolytes are of tremendous significance in biological context and applications in healthcare. However, a rigorous theoretical formulation of gel behavior continues to be a challenge due to the presence of multiple length and time scales in the system which operate simultaneously. Furthermore, chain connectivity, the electrostatic interaction, and the hydrodynamic interaction all lead to long-range interactions. In spite of these complications, considerable progress has been achieved over the past several decades in generating theories of variable complexity. The present review presents an analytically tractable theory by accounting for correlations emerging from topological, electrostatic, and hydrodynamic interactions. Closed-form formulas are derived for charged hydrogels to describe their swelling equilibrium, elastic moduli, and the relationship between microscopic properties such as gel diffusion and macroscopic properties such as elasticity. In addition, electrostatic coupling between charged moieties and their ion clouds, which significantly modifies the elastic diffusion coefficient of gels, and various scaling laws are presented. The theoretical formulas summarized here are useful to adequately capture the essentials of the physics of charged gels and to design new hydrogels with specified elastic and dynamical properties.
