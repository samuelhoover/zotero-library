Title:          Alpha-Synuclein and Cognitive Decline in Parkinson Disease
Subject:        Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in elderly people. It is characterized by the aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein throughout the nervous system. Aside from cardinal motor symptoms, cognitive impairment is one of the most disabling non-motor symptoms that occurs during the progression of the disease. The accumulation and spreading of alpha-synuclein pathology from the brainstem to limbic and neocortical structures is correlated with emerging cognitive decline in PD. This review summarizes the genetic and pathophysiologic relationship between alpha-synuclein and cognitive impairment in PD, together with potential areas of biomarker advancement.
