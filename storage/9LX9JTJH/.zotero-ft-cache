Block Copolymers: Long-Term Growth with Added Value
O
ver the past 60 years block copolymers have evolved from a niche component to a major theme of contemporary macromolecular science and engineering. This represents the happy confluence of significant advances in several related areas: (i) controlled polymerization, beginning with living anionic polymerization in the late 1950s and expanding with ATRP, RAFT, ROMP, and others since the 1990s; (ii) facile molecular characterization, especially via NMR spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography, since the 1970s; (iii) reliable nanostructural identification, partly via rheological means but particularly via the powerful combination of TEM and SAXS; and (iv) quantitative and accessible theory, which can both guide the search for new structures and rationalize the unexpected appearance of a previously unprecedented symmetry. This editorial is concerned primarily with this last topic, and in particular two landmark theory papers that appeared in this journal and have both inspired and guided the community in multiple, highly productive directions. The first is the legendary paper by Ludwik Leibler, “Theory of Microphase Separation in Block Copolymers”, which appeared toward the end of 1980 and has since been cited over
3200 times.1 The second is a review by Mark Matsen and Frank Bates, “Unif ying Weak- and Strong-Segregation Block Copolymer Theories”, published early in 1996 and so far cited
over 1300 times.2 Prior to considering these two papers, it is helpful to recall briefly the “state of play” in the preceding decades. Although block copolymers had been prepared as early at the 1930s, the first “deliberate” AB diblocks and ABA triblocks came from the Szwarc group, primarily to prove the success of their first living
anionic polymerization of polystyrene and polyisoprene.3 Indeed, to this day successful preparation of well-defined block polymers remains the strongest proof of a living polymerization. Self-assembly of block copolymers was studied throughout the 1960s and 1970s, notably by groups in Strasbourg and Kyoto as well as at Shell and other companies involved in commercialization. The prevalence of lamellar (L), hexagonally packed cylinders (C), and arrays of spheres (S) was well-known, primarily through TEM analysis. In fact, even
the double gyroid (G) had been seen as early as 1976,4 albeit not correctly identified until much later. At that time, the plethora of other phases accessible to diblocks was neither imagined nor suggested by experiment. For neat block copolymers the degree of segregation (quantified by the product of the volumetric degree of polymerization, N, and the segment−segment interaction parameter, χ) was typically 50 or more, placing them in what is now known as the “strong segregation regime”, where the centers of the two nanodomains are essentially either pure A or pure B. The first attempt to describe these phases with a quantitative theory was contributed by Dale Meier, who correctly captured the underlying free energy competition that drives self-assembly: balancing the interfacial energy penalty versus the entropic cost
of chain stretching.5 Gene Helfand and co-workers adopted the
self-consistent field approach pioneered by Sam Edwards6 and
under the so-called “narrow interface approximation” could capture the evolution from S → C → L → C → S with composition fA, as well as the strong-segregation scaling of
domain spacing d with N2/3.7,8 With this backdrop, Leibler’s paper appeared like a bolt from the blue. Unlike many theoretical contributions, it attempted to answer questions that had not even been asked before. It brought a coherence and a roadmap to the phase behavior of block copolymers in the bulkone that is still being vigorously pursued and refined to this day. Among the notably novel aspects of the work were the following: (i) the use of de Gennes’ random phase approximation (RPA) in block
copolymers,9 as the necessary closure relation to obtain explicit expressions for correlation functions and free energies of copolymer melts; (ii) the first reduction of the phase portrait to a universal function of (χN) and f; (iii) the first calculation of the order−disorder transition (ODT) as a function of f (which Leibler termed the microphase separation transition); (iv) the prediction that there was a critical point at (χN) ≈ 10.5 for fA = 1/2 but that otherwise the ODT would be
a first-order transition into a BCC phase; (v) systematic calculation of stability for multiple ordered phases and prediction of order−order transitions (OOTs) between phases of different symmetry (e.g., BCC → HEX; HEX → LAM); (vi) computation of the structure factor S(q) in the disordered phase, showing for the first time how SANS or SAXS could be used to obtain a quantitative measure of χ(T); (vii) recognition that fluctuations would play a strong role in the vicinity of the ODT; and (viii) the first treatment of the putative “weak-segregation” regime, where the lamellar composition profile would be closer to a sine wave than a square wave. This breakthrough paper galvanized a great deal of experimental effort, directed at preparing block copolymers with lower N and/or lower χ in order to access the ODT and the disordered melt. These studies demonstrated the power of rheology (especially the elastic modulus G′ at fixed, low
frequency) to report on the location of the ODT10 (although of course not to directly identify the ordered state
symmetry).11 The major features of the Leibler treatment were amply confirmed, but in many respects there was much more to be learned from differences between theory and experiment. One key example of this was the fact that the ODT was often a direct transition into L, C, or G, without passing through BCC. This observation is consistent with the notion that fluctuations stabilized the disordered state, such that the ODT occurred at a higher value of χN, thereby bypassing the predicted narrow window of BCC. Glenn Fredrickson and Gene Helfand proposed a pioneering fluctuation theory that rationalized many of these experimental observations, but it was not quantitatively reliable for the finite N of interest or for
a broad range of fA.12 A recent renormalized one-loop (ROL) calculation by the group of David Morse provides a more

accurate treatment of this phenomenon,13 and direct field
theoretic simulations are also feasible.14 A second, related example was the experimental observation that the position of the peak of the disordered state structure factor, q*, varied systematically with temperature, in contrast to the temperature
independence of the Leibler model.15 This can be attributed to the onset of chain stretching well before the ODT, which is also intimately tied into the fluctuation phenomena. It also calls into question the very existence of a “weak segregation regime” in the vicinity of the ODT. In other words, the assumption that the domain spacing d would scale as N1/2 near the ODT, then transitioning to N2/3 in the strong segregation regime, needed to be reconsidered. This topic is one of many
addressed in the Matsen and Bates paper.2 By 1996 the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) was established as a reliable method for computing free energies of various ordered states; a particularly notable contribution to fast and accurate SCFT calculations was provided by Matsen
and Michael Schick.16 In a sense this is an easier task than finding the ODT reliably, which necessarily requires computing accurate free energies for both ordered and disordered states, yet SCFT can still be computationally intensive. First, a candidate symmetry is selected, and the free energy is minimized with respect to d; then, the process is repeated for all other symmetries of interest. The differences among various symmetries can be extremely subtle. One major focus of the paper is the difficulty in knowing whether G remains stable into the strong segregation regime. It turns out that even using 450 basis functions is not sufficient to answer this question with certainty, although the authors conjecture the answer is “no”. Later calculations and experiments suggest, in fact, that the answer is “yes”, or at least that G persists
beyond χN > 100.17−19 The required number of basis functions increases with χN, making this kind of analysis particularly challenging. The Matsen and Bates paper does a masterful job in comparing the approximations used in all the various theoretical approaches, which makes it of great pedagogical value. It also highlights how a deeper understanding of the various ordered states can be achieved, such as the precise composition profiles and the change in primary peak position Δq* on traversing an OOT. Although not a main focus of this paper, the authors note that conformational asymmetry can play a key role, especially given the delicate free energy balance among phases; this consideration does suggest that a truly universal phase map cannot be obtained based on χN and f alone. Nevertheless, the SCFT has to be considered one of the triumphs of soft condensed matter, providing in most cases a quantitative calculation of the free energy of any structure. It can be directly extended to include conformational asymmetry, dispersity in block lengths, multiple blocks, branched architectures, and multiple monomers. It also usable by the nonexpert, as exemplified by a recent freely downloadable
module.20 Both of these landmark papers have been crucial in advancing the ongoing duet between block copolymer experiment and theory. Since the Leiber paper appeared, several other equilibrium ordered phases have been found in AB diblocks, although this statement must be qualified by acknowledging the difficulties in proving equilibrium, both by experiment and by theory (see Figure 1). Some were anticipated first by theory, such as close-packed spheres
(FCC or HCP),21 the Fddd network phase,22 and A15,23
followed by subsequent experimental confirmation.24−26 Others were seen first in experiment, such as the double
gyroid, the Frank−Kasper σ phase,27 and a dodecagonal quasi
crystal,28 and subsequently confirmed by theory.16,29 Both of these papers remain highly relevant today, as indicated by the citation history in Figure 2. The Leibler paper has been cited over 100 times per year for the past 25 years, while the Matsen and Bates paper continues to trend upward at about 75 citations annually. Four decades after Leibler’s paper, block copolymers continue to fascinate the community. As one simple metric, approximately 10% of the papers published in this journal in 2018 contained the term “block copolymer” in the titlemore than double the frequency in 1980. Indicators such as this, and the data in Figure 2, confirm the continued growth of interest in these exemplary self-assembling macromolecules. In addition to fundamental understanding, this growth is fueled by the search for valuespecifically, high-value-added polymer materials that provide unique functionality based on prescribed nanostructure. Target applications include directed selfassembly and lithography, battery separators, fuel cell membranes, photovoltaics, nanoporous materials for filtration or catalysis, actuators, polymer gel electrolytes, gate dielectrics in organic transistors, renewable and recyclable materials,
implants, and therapeutic delivery vehicles, to name a few.10 It will be fascinating to see how many different roles block
