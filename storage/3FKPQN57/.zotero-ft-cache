The surface roughness of deposited conducting thin films is responsible for various materials reliability problems in nanoelectronics and nanofabrication technologies. Here, we report a modeling and simulation study that aims at optimizing the electrical surface treatment of deposited conducting thin films as a physical processing strategy for their surface roughness reduction. Our study is based on a continuum model of film surface morphological evolution that accounts for the residual stress in the deposited conducting thin film, the film‚Äôs wetting of the substrate layer that it is deposited on, film texture and surface diffusional anisotropy, and surface electromigration. Through systematic linear stability analysis and dynamical simulation protocols, we examine in detail the effects of film surface crystallographic orientation and applied electric field direction toward minimizing the electric field strength required for film surface smoothening. We find that the critical electric field strength requirement for surface roughness reduction on {110}, {100}, and {111} surfaces of facecentered cubic crystalline conducting thin films exhibits a very strong dependence on the applied electric field direction, expressed as the electric field misalignment with respect to the principal residual stress directions in the film and the fast surface diffusion directions. Based on these findings, we optimize the electrical treatment strategy for surface roughness reduction of conducting thin films with respect to all relevant processing and material parameters.

I. INTRODUCTION
Surface roughness is ubiquitous in deposited metallic thin films that are used widely in the fabrication of plasmonic,1,2 electronic,3,4 and optoelectronic5,6 devices. Surface roughening occurs during various chemical7,8 and physical9‚Äì12 deposition processes. Tuning the deposition conditions can result in slightly smoother thin film surfaces;13,14 however, thermal annealing, usually an inevitable process for the relief of stresses in deposited thin films and the activation of charge carrier transport in electronic materials, causes further surface morphological evolution that can increase substantially the roughness of the deposited metallic thin films.15 The surface roughness of deposited conducting thin films is responsible for significant reductions in the thermal16‚Äì18 and electrical19‚Äì21 conductance of such films due to the significantly increased scattering of phonons and electrons in their transport through these films. As a result of the continuous miniaturization of electronic devices, the thickness and width of the metallic thin films in these devices become increasingly smaller. The adverse effects of surface roughness, namely, nanometer-scale surface roughness, in such nanoscale-thin films are becoming more important;22 consequently, such nanoscale surface roughness not only hinders the further enhancement of the integration density in integrated circuits (ICs) but may also lead to stronger Joule heating effects, decreasing the energy efficiency of modern electronic devices.
The mass transport phenomenon of electromigration, driven by electric current in conducting materials, has long been identified as the culprit for the short-cut or opencircuit failures of ICs.23‚Äì25 However, in spite of these catastrophic electromigration effects, it has been shown theoretically that electric current, if sufficiently strong and well controlled, can counteract other surface destabilizing effects driven by mechanical stresses and/or thermal gradients and stabilize a planar surface morphology.26‚Äì30 These thin film surface smoothening effects of electromigration have also been observed in experiments, which demonstrated that nanoscale rough copper thin films deposited on silicon nitride layers become much smoother after electrical treatment.31 Inspired by the above theoretical findings and experimental observations, we developed a threedimensional (3D) continuum model for driven surface morphological evolution in deposited conducting thin films. Based on this model, we reproduced in self-consistent dynamical simulations the experimental observations and demonstrated that electric current treatment could effectively reduce the thin film surface roughness, which, in the absence of the electrical treatment, increases under the action of the residual stresses in the deposited films.32 Our study established the electrical treatment strategy as a viable physical processing technique for surface roughness reduction of deposited conducting thin films. The purpose of this article is to explore systematically the effects of the various processing conditions and material parameters on the effectiveness of surface roughness reduction by electrical treatment of deposited conducting thin films and, by quantifying these effects, to optimize the

application of the electric field, i.e., through minimizing the electric field strength requirement for the films‚Äô surface roughness reduction. Toward this end, we employ our 3D fully nonlinear model of driven surface morphological evolution for such deposited conducting thin films in order to analyze the morphological stability of the films‚Äô planar smooth surfaces.
II. SURFACE EVOLUTION MODEL
We consider a metallic thin film, with a nominal film thickness of h0, deposited on a thick rigid substrate, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The film is subject to an equibiaxial compressive stress, with nonzero stress components œÉxx 1‚ÅÑ4 œÉyy 1‚ÅÑ4 œÉ0 in the x- and y-directions, respectively, of a Cartesian frame of reference; the Cartesian axes are chosen to align with the principal stress directions in the biaxially stressed deposited film to simplify the mathematical analysis of the elastostatic boundary-value problem. The stress level œÉ0 is typical of the residual stress in deposited copper interconnects33,34 and lower than the compressive yield strength of copper;35 thus, plastic deformation phenomena in the film can be safely neglected. An electric field E0, parallel to the xy-plane in the Cartesian reference frame, is applied to the thin film and its direction forms an angle fE with the x-direction. We use the surface height function, h(x, y, t), to parameterize the surface morphology of the film; h 1‚ÅÑ4 0 refers to the planar surface of the substrate. Following classical phenomenology, the surface atomic flux is given by a Nernst-Einstein equation. Expressing mass conservation through a continuity equation involving this flux gives the height evolution equation

The surface diffusivity, Ds, is expressed by a transversely isotropic tensor29

The surface orientation angle Œ∏Œ± is formed between the surface tangent vector, tŒ±, and the Œ±-axis, the misorientation angle fŒ± is formed between the Œ±-axis and the fast surface diffusion direction, A is the strength of the anisotropy, and m is the number of fast surface diffusion directions, as indicated by the dashed lines in Figs. 2(a1), 2(b1), and 2(c1) for {110}, {100}, and {111} surfaces, with m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, m 1‚ÅÑ4 2, and m 1‚ÅÑ4 3, respectively. To minimize the structural complexity of the model, we consider only single crystalline films but set the film surface crystallographic orientation by setting the value of m to model the textured films used for metallic interconnects. The misorientation angle fx is denoted in Fig. 2 and fy can be determined by fx: fy 1‚ÅÑ4

and fy 1‚ÅÑ4 30  fx for {111} surfaces. Due to this simple dependence of fy on fx, the anisotropy function can be expressed as a function f (fx) for specified values of Œ∏Œ±, m, and A. These functions f (fx) are plotted in Figs. 2(a2), 2(b2), and 2(c2) for m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, 2, and 3, respectively, at Œ∏x 1‚ÅÑ4 0 and Œ∏y 1‚ÅÑ4 0 for A 1‚ÅÑ4 10.

The film surface morphological evolution is monitored by integrating Eq.

Finally, it should be noted that, in the above model, all the material properties of the crystalline film, such as elastic properties and surface free energy, are assumed to be isotropic. Only the surface diffusivity is taken to be anisotropic, since anisotropy in surface mass transport is the strongest (kinetic) anisotropy in the conducting crystalline films under consideration in this study.33,36,37

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Morphological stability analysis
The morphological instability of a smooth planar film surface leads to surface roughening. An applied electric field that can reduce the film surface roughness should be able to stabilize the smooth planar surface morphology. Thus, a linear stability analysis for the morphological response of planar film surfaces to low-amplitude shape perturbations can predict the condition for the onset of surface smoothening. Toward this end, we conduct a linear morphological stability analysis, where the planar surface of a stressed thin film is perturbed by a low-amplitude plane wave, Œî0 exp (ik  x), with wave vector k 1‚ÅÑ4 (kx, ky). The surface tangential component of the electric field, Es, and the surface elastic strain energy density, UE, can be calculated asymptotically by solving the corresponding 3D electrostatic and elastostatic boundary-value problems, based on regular perturbation
theory.39‚Äì41 An analogous asymptotic expansion with terms

Equation (4) predicts the initial growth (œâ . 0) or decay (œâ , 0) rate of a plane-wave perturbation amplitude, and the sign of œâ determines if a perturbation of wave number k will grow or decay over time. As shown in Figs. 2(a1)‚Äì2(c1), different surface crystallographic orientations correspond to very different atomic arrangements on the surface plane. The surface diffusional anisotropy function f in Eq. (2) has widely different values as fx is varied at Œ∏x 1‚ÅÑ4 0 than at Œ∏y 1‚ÅÑ4 0, as seen in Figs. 2(a2) and 2(c2), resulting in the dependence of Œ≤ and Œæ in Eq. (4) on not only the wave number k but also the direction of the plane-wave perturbation wave vector. Although Œ≤ 1‚ÅÑ4 1 for {100} surfaces, due to the identical profile of f (fx) at Œ∏x 1‚ÅÑ4 0 with that at Œ∏y 1‚ÅÑ4 0, as shown in Fig. 2(b1), the parameter Œæ still depends on the plane-wave perturbation wave vector direction. The critical electric field strength required to stabilize the planar surface morphology, by leading to decay of the surface shape perturbation amplitude at any perturbation wave number and for any perturbation wave vector direction, is derived from Eq. (4) to be

For a better fundamental understanding of the dependence of œâ on the perturbation wave number k and its wave vector direction, we calculate œâ as a function of the wave vector (kx, ky), for {110}, {100}, and {111} surfaces, and plot the results in Figs. 3(a1)‚Äì3(a4), 3(b1)‚Äì3(b4), and 3(c1)‚Äì3(c4), respectively. Without any loss of generality, the parameters chosen to plot such representative results in Fig. 3 are ŒûW 1‚ÅÑ4 0:05, fx 1‚ÅÑ4 10, fE 1‚ÅÑ4 20, and A 1‚ÅÑ4 10. The resulting ŒûE,c can be easily calculated using Eq. (5). Figure 3(a1) shows the contour map of œâ for a {110} surface as a function of the plane-wave perturbation wave vector (kx, ky) with

ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 ŒûE,c. The contours are either open curves or elliptically shaped loops, as opposed to round circular loops that would be the case for isotropic surfaces with respect to atomic diffusion, indicating that œâ changes with both the wave number k and the wave vector direction of a plane-wave perturbation. If œâ is always non-positive for any wave vector (kx, ky), then the application of an external electric field suppresses completely the growth of surface roughness, which is the case for applied electric field strengths ŒûE  ŒûE,c. A lower-than-critical electric field is unable to reduce the amplitude of long-wavelength perturbations. For the surface of a biaxially stressed film, another possibility is that a lower-than-critical electric field can cause the decay of surface perturbations in some directions only, but not along all wave vector directions. As seen in Fig. 3(a2), the contour map of œâ with ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:6 ŒûE,c, surface perturbations with kx close to zero decay, while those with ky close to zero grow. In this wave-vector landscape, there is a critical electric field, Œûd
E,c(Œ∏k), that guarantees morphological stabilization with respect to perturbations in a particular direction Œ∏k ; arctan (ky=kx). The critical electric field strength required for the full planar surface morphological stabilization at any wave vector direction is the maximum of Œûd
E,c (Œ∏k ). In Fig. 3(a3), œâ is plotted as a function of k with (1) ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0, (2) ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:6 ŒûE,c, (3) ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 ŒûE,c, and (4) ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 1:6 ŒûE,c, with
the perturbation wave vector directions being at Œ∏k 1‚ÅÑ4 0. Curves (1) and (2) show that a lower-than-critical electric field is unable to reduce the long-wavelength perturbations, while curves (3) and (4) show that a larger-than-critical electric field can reduce perturbations of any wave number k. Curve (3) also represents the criticality condition for morphological stabilization at Œ∏k 1‚ÅÑ4 0; thus, ŒûE,c is equal to Œûd
E,c(Œ∏k 1‚ÅÑ4 0). In Fig. 3(a4), k 1‚ÅÑ4 1, and œâ is plotted as a function of Œ∏k with (1) ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0, (2) ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:6 ŒûE,c, (3) ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 ŒûE,c, and (4) ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 1:6 ŒûE,c. Curve (1) shows that in the absence of an externally applied electric field, surface perturbations in any wave vector direction grow. Curve (2) shows that with a lower-than-critical electric field applied, surface perturbations in some wave vector directions decay, while those in other wave vector directions still grow. Curves (3) and (4) show that for a stronger-than-critical electric field surface perturbations decay in all wave vector directions. Figures 3(b1)‚Äì3(b4) and 3(c1)‚Äì3(c4) demonstrate the dependence of œâ on the wave number and the wave vector direction of plane-wave perturbations for {100} and {111} surfaces, respectively. In a manner similar to the response depicted in Fig. 3(a1), Figs. 3(b1) and 3(c1) show that œâ  0 for all perturbations when ŒûE  ŒûE,c. For ŒûE , ŒûE,c, Figs. 3(b2) and 3(c2) exhibit different contours from those in Fig. 3(a2), implying that different patterns may form on

perturbed surfaces with different crystallographic orientations. Note that in Fig. 3(b3), curve (2) shows that an electric field of strength ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:6 ŒûE,c can reduce the amplitude of any perturbation with Œ∏k 1‚ÅÑ4 0, meaning that although ŒûE is lower than ŒûE,c in this case, it is stronger than Œûd
E,c(Œ∏k 1‚ÅÑ4 0).
However, ŒûE is still weaker than Œûd
E,c(Œ∏k 1‚ÅÑ4 +œÄ=2) and, thus, unable to reduce the amplitude of perturbations in the perpendicular direction, Œ∏k 1‚ÅÑ4 +œÄ=2, as shown by curve (2) in Fig. 3(b4). In Fig. 3(c3), curve (3) falls completely below the level of œâ 1‚ÅÑ4 0, meaning that ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 ŒûE,c is stronger than Œûd
E,c(Œ∏k 1‚ÅÑ4 0). Furthermore, curve (2) in Fig. 3(c4) shows that ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:6 ŒûE,c is unable to reduce the amplitude of perturbations with wave number k 1‚ÅÑ4 1 in any wave vector direction on {111} surfaces, contrary to the cases shown in Figs. 3(a4) and 3(b4). In general, the results of Fig. 3 emphasize the importance of designing the external electric field application so that the planar surface morphology can be stabilized against plane-wave perturbations of any wave vector in order to guarantee surface roughness reduction. Equation (5) can be used to calculate the critical electric field strength ŒûE,c for a particular material system at a known electric field direction expressed by the alignment angle fE. However, we can go beyond this prediction and find out the optimal electric field direction, i.e., an alignment angle fE,o that can minimize the value of the critical electric field strength ŒûE,c required to stabilize the smooth planar surface morphology. The inset in Fig. 4 shows plots of the critical electric field strength, Œûd
E,c(Œ∏k), for the reduction of surface plane wave perturbations as a function of the plane wave perturbation wave-vector direction, Œ∏k, with the electric field alignment angle, fE, set at 10, 20, 45 70, and 80, respectively. These curves show that for a particular value of fE, Œûd
E,c varies with Œ∏k. Thus, for a given fE, the critical electric field, ŒûE,c(fE), that can fully stabilize a planar surface for any perturbation wave vector is the maximum value of Œûd
E,c, or the peak value of each curve. Analyzing all of these curves gives the main plot of Fig. 4, where ŒûE,c(fE)
is plotted. The location of the minimum in this plot gives the optimal electric field direction, at an angle fE,o with the x-axis and the corresponding minimum electric field strength ŒûE,c required for planar surface stabilization and roughness reduction. It is worth noting that fE,o is always the angle that
makes Œûd
E,c a uniform (constant) function of Œ∏k, as shown by
the curve at fE 1‚ÅÑ4 45, the straight horizontal line in the inset plot of Fig. 4. This criticality condition is expressed ana

Note that the parameter Œõ is cancelled out in the expressions for the optimal values of Eqs. (6) and (7). For roughness reduction of a Cu thin film surface in a typical Cu/Si3N4 system, i.e., a Cu thin film deposited on a Si3N4 layer, and for the experimental conditions and parameters reported in Ref. 31, Eq. (7) predicts a dimensionless value of critical electric field strength ŒûE,c 1‚ÅÑ4 0:265, which corresponds to a current density of 2  104 A/cm2.32 These results are consistent (in the proper asymptotic limits) with those obtained for the current-driven morphological stabilization of uniaxially stressed bulk solid surfaces.26

exactly the conclusion in Ref. 26. In closing this morphological stability analysis, we summarize the key findings of the linear stability theory: (1) a sufficiently strong and properly aligned electric field can stabilize morphological perturbations from a smooth planar surface in any direction and of any wavelength; (2) the electric field alignment angle fE is an important parameter that affects the electric field strength requirement for the onset of surface roughness reduction (through stabilization of the smooth planar surface against roughening shape perturbations); and (3) the optimal electric field alignment angle, fE,o, and the corresponding lowest critical electric field strength requirement, ŒûE,c, are derived in Eqs. (6) and (7), respectively, and these criticality conditions determine the electric-field-induced onset of surface roughness reduction of a crystalline conducting film.

B. Simulations of surface morphological evolution
To validate the conclusions of the linear stability theory (LST), we conducted self-consistent dynamical simulations of the stressed film surface morphological evolution according to the surface evolution model of Sec. II. We discretized the film surface into a grid of 128  128 grid points, employed a spectral collocation method to compute the stress field39 and the tangential component of the electric field at each grid point, and integrated Eq. (1) with an advanced operator splitting-based semi-implicit spectral method with adaptive time step size.42 We conducted numerous simulation protocols over the range of our model parameters in order to validate the application of the electric field as a processing strategy for
film surface roughness reduction as predicted by LST. Representative results for the film surface morphological evolution are shown in Fig. 5 for a typical set of surface diffusional anisotropy parameters (A 1‚ÅÑ4 10, m 1‚ÅÑ4 2, fx 1‚ÅÑ4 25), a scaled wetting potential ŒûW 1‚ÅÑ4 0:1, and a fixed electric field direction fE 1‚ÅÑ4 49. According to Eq. (5), for this parameter set, ŒûE,c  0:357. Figures 5(a1)‚Äì5(a4) show top views of configurations of the evolving surface morphology under the action of an electric field with ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:03 , ŒûE,c. The initial randomly perturbed planar surface with nanoscale roughness, as shown in Fig. 5(a1), is not morphologically stable under the action of the biaxial stress in the film. The perturbation amplitude grows and the film surface evolves into a rough landscape consisting of 3D islands. During this surface morphological evolution, the valleys between these islands keep

ŒûE,c at t 1‚ÅÑ4 0, t 1‚ÅÑ4 0:09, t 1‚ÅÑ4 0:49, and t 1‚ÅÑ4 2:00; and (d1)-(d4) ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:43 . ŒûE,c at t 1‚ÅÑ4 0, t 1‚ÅÑ4 0:09, t 1‚ÅÑ4 0:49, and t 1‚ÅÑ4 2:00. In all cases, 1D surface profiles, h(x; y, t), along the black solid lines marked on the 2D maps are plotted in the insets. The initial surface configurations of (a1), (b1), and (c1) exhibit nanoscale roughness, while that of (d1) is merely characterized by atomic-scale roughness due to thermal fluctuations. Parameter values: Œõ 1‚ÅÑ4 1, ŒûW 1‚ÅÑ4 0:1, A 1‚ÅÑ4 10, m 1‚ÅÑ4 2, fx 1‚ÅÑ4 25, and fE 1‚ÅÑ4 49.

deepening into the film until they reach a very thin wetting layer over the substrate, as seen in the inset of Fig. 5(a4). In the absence of any wetting effects between the film and the substrate (i.e., in the ŒûW ! 0 limit), the film would eventually break into pieces under the action of the biaxial stress. Figures 5(b1)‚Äì5(b4) show the sequence of configurations in the evolution of the film surface morphology under the action of an electric field with ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:23 , ŒûE,c. The initial surface morphology, as shown in Fig. 5(b1), is identical to that of Fig. 5(a1) exhibiting the same nanoscale roughness. In this case, although the electric field is still weaker than the critical electric field for surface smoothening, it is stronger than Œûd
E,c(Œ∏k) over a broad range of Œ∏k, meaning that the electric field is still capable of reducing roughness by causing decay of surface perturbations over a broad range of perturbation wave vector directions. However, over a certain narrow range of Œ∏k, ŒûE , Œûd
E,c(Œ∏k), resulting in the growth of the corresponding surface perturbations. Consequently, the initially randomly perturbed surface evolves gradually into a strip pattern, as shown in Fig. 5(b4). Applying an electric field with a strength of ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:43 . ŒûE,c to the same initially nanoscale rough surface, Fig. 5(c1), leads to a gradual reduction of the surface roughness and evolution of the surface to a smooth planar state, as shown in Figs. 5(c1)‚Äì5(c4). In the case of Figs. 5(d1)‚Äì5(d4), the electric field of strength ŒûE 1‚ÅÑ4 0:43 was applied to a film with an initially planar surface perturbed by a very low-amplitude random shape perturbation corresponding to mere thermal fluctuations, as shown in Fig. 5(d1). The surface morphological evolution leads again to a smooth planar surface morphology, as shown in Fig. 5(d4). This dynamical response demonstrates that an applied electric field with larger-than-critical electric field strength can be used to drive surface mass transport that can reduce even atomic-scale roughness caused by thermal fluctuations. To quantitatively demonstrate the evolution of the film surface roughness of the four cases presented in Fig. 5, the evolution of the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the surface configurations of Fig. 5 has been calculated according to the equation

and the resulting surface RMS roughness is plotted as a function of time in all four cases in Fig. 6. Curve (1) corresponds to the film surface evolution of Figs. 5(a1)‚Äì5(a4) and shows that the very weak electric field applied in this case is unable to reduce the surface roughness. Instead, the RMS roughness of the film surface grows at a fast rate and reaches a plateau value over a time period of about t 1‚ÅÑ4 1:5 œÑ. Curve (2) corresponds to the film surface morphological evolution of Figs. 5(b1)‚Äì5(b4) and shows that, in this case, the application of the electric field slows down the growth rate of the surface roughness, although the applied field is not sufficiently strong to reduce the surface roughness; the surface morphology evolves and its RMS roughness reaches a steady state that corresponds to the striped surface configuration of
Fig. 5(b4). On the contrary, curves (3) and (4), corresponding to the surface morphological evolution of Figs. 5(c1)‚Äì5(c4) and 5(d1)‚Äì5(d4), respectively, demonstrate that the application of a stronger-than-critical electric field can continuously reduce the film surface roughness resulting in a continuous decay over time of the surface RMS roughness. The most important LST predictions are the optimal electric field alignment angle (direction) given by Eq. (6) and the corresponding critical electric field strength requirement given by Eq. (7) that prescribe how the electric field should be applied in order to achieve surface roughness reduction. To validate these predictions, for each pair of optimal values (fE,o, ŒûE,c) predicted by LST, hundreds of dynamical simulations were conducted with the pair of parameters (fE, ŒûE) chosen to be in the vicinity of (fE,o, ŒûE,c), to numerically locate the actual (i.e., numerically accurate according to the fully nonlinear model) optimal values fE,o and ŒûE,c. This approach is illustrated with an example shown in Fig. 7(a) for representative values of the parameters A, fx, and ŒûW at m 1‚ÅÑ4 2. The open circle in the diagram of Fig. 7(a) represents the LST prediction. The solid squares represent the simulation results, with yellow (black) color indicating the success (failure) of the electric field application to accomplish film surface roughness reduction. The solid squares indicate that fE,o lies over a range of angles from about 38 to 52, while the numerically predicted ŒûE,c is practically identical with that predicted by LST. For a given thin film, the principal directions of the biaxial stress in the film are always taken to be the x- and y-directions, respectively, with an angle of fx formed between the x-axis and the closest fast diffusion direction. The value of fx also affects the optimal values of fE,o and ŒûE,o significantly. For a {110} (m 1‚ÅÑ4 1) surface, as the angle fx is varied from 90 to 0, the value of fE,o changes from
90 to 0, while the value of ŒûE,c first decreases and then increases, as shown by the curves (LST prediction) in Fig. 7(b). At fx 1‚ÅÑ4 45, ŒûE,c exhibits a minimum, meaning that the surface roughness is the easiest to reduce by application of an electric field (minimum electric field strength requirement) if the stress acts on this particular direction with

Parameter values: identical to those of Fig. 5.

respect to the fast diffusion direction. Five values of fx were chosen, evenly distributed across the domain of fx, for which the fE,o and ŒûE,c values were calculated numerically by the approach illustrated in Fig. 7(a), and are denoted with open circles and solid squares, respectively, in Fig. 7(b). The comparison of the LST predictions with the simulation results for fE,o and ŒûE,c shows a good agreement over a broad range of fx, except for fx values close to its domain
ends, i.e., close to 90 or 0, where LST overpredicts ŒûE,c compared to the simulation results. For {100} (m 1‚ÅÑ4 2) surfaces, where fx is always equal to fy, fE,o does not vary
with fx, and is always equal to 45, as shown by the horizontal line in Fig. 7(c) which is also in very good agreement with the simulation predictions. The LST-predicted ŒûE,c(fx)
exhibits a minimum at fx 1‚ÅÑ4 36:5, with the simulation results being in very good agreement with the LST predictions. Finally, for a {111} (m 1‚ÅÑ4 3) surface, the trends of fE,o and ŒûE,c as functions of fx, as shown in Fig. 7(d), are very similar to those for {110} surfaces. The minimum ŒûE,c is located at fx 1‚ÅÑ4 15 with fE,o 1‚ÅÑ4 45 in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation results.
C. Optimal electric field strength
With the above systematic validation of linear stability theory, we then focus on investigating the effects of the film thickness analytically using the major conclusions of the linear stability theory, Eqs. (6) and (7). The dependence of ŒûE,c on the nominal film thickness h0 is derived according to Eq. (7) through the dependence of the wetting potential strength ŒûW on h0. In Fig. 8, ŒûE,c is plotted as a function of
the film thickness h0 (made dimensionless with the natural length scale l) for all the three surface crystallographic orientations examined, m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, m 1‚ÅÑ4 2, and m 1‚ÅÑ4 3. The angles fx and fE are chosen to minimize ŒûE,c, and their values correspond to the minima of the ŒûE,c(fx) plots in Figs. 7(b)‚Äì7(d) for m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Figure 8 shows that when h0  hc, ŒûE,c is equal to zero, i.e., no electric field is required for surface roughness reduction, which means that the wetting effects can stabilize the planar surface morphology of a film that is thinner than a critical thickness hc. The dimensionless critical thickness, under the assumption of isotropic surface energy, is independent of the surface crystallographic orientation and is given by [2b(Œ≥0  Œ≥)=(œÄŒ≥)]1=3. For film thicknesses higher than hc, the electric field strength requirement ŒûE,c increases with increasing film thickness. This trend in the ŒûE,c(h0) dependence is exhibited because the wetting potential at the surface is decreased as the film thickness is increased, and a stronger electric field is required to stabilize the planar film surface morphology. As the film thickness keeps increasing, the stabilizing effect of the wetting potential is gradually diminished, and the critical electric field strength ŒûE,c reaches a plateau value. This constant value of ŒûE,c depends largely on the surface crystallographic orientation. The ŒûE,c plateau value for m 1‚ÅÑ4 1 is several times higher than that for m 1‚ÅÑ4 2 and m 1‚ÅÑ4 3. We also see that, among the surface orientations examined in this study, the ŒûE,c strength required to stabilize the planar surface morphology is lowest for the {100} surface, m 1‚ÅÑ4 2.

mize ŒûE,c. Specifically, for m 1‚ÅÑ4 1, fx 1‚ÅÑ4 45 and fE 1‚ÅÑ4 45; for m 1‚ÅÑ4 2,
fx 1‚ÅÑ4 36:57 and fE 1‚ÅÑ4 45; and for m 1‚ÅÑ4 3, fx 1‚ÅÑ4 15 and fE 1‚ÅÑ4 45. Other parameter values: A 1‚ÅÑ4 10.

The angles fx and fE are chosen to minimize ŒûE,c and are identical with those in Fig. 8. Other parameter values: ŒûW 1‚ÅÑ4 0:1.

The effect of the anisotropy strength, A, is also studied on the basis of the LST conclusions for all the three surface crystallographic orientations examined. The corresponding plots of ŒûE,c as a function of A are shown in Fig. 9. The angles fx and fE are kept at the same optimal values as those used to yield the results of Fig. 8. The wetting potential is chosen to have the representative value ŒûW 1‚ÅÑ4 0:1. In a manner similar to the trends of Fig. 8, {110} surfaces are found to require the largest ŒûE,c strength for planar surface morphology stabilization among the surface orientations examined. However, we find that a crossover value of approximately 6 exists for A, below which the {111} surface, m 1‚ÅÑ4 3, has the lowest ŒûE,c requirement, and above which the {100} surface, m 1‚ÅÑ4 2, has the lowest ŒûE,c requirement for planar surface morphological stabilization and, therefore, surface roughness reduction.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we developed a fully nonlinear continuum model for the surface morphological evolution of deposited conducting thin films, accounting for the residual equibiaxial stress in the film, the wetting effect between the film and the substrate, the film‚Äôs surface tension and the diffusional anisotropy of the film‚Äôs surface, and the action of an externally applied electric field that drives surface electromigration. Using linear stability analysis and self-consistent dynamical simulations, we found that sufficiently strong electric fields can be used to reduce significantly the films‚Äô nanoscale surface roughness, achieving atomic-scale smoothness. To optimize the electrical treatment strategy for the films‚Äô surface roughness reduction, we conducted a systematic parametric study and derived the optimal electric-field direction for minimizing the electric field strength required for surface roughness reduction and calculated the corresponding electric field strength for different surface crystallographic orientations. We found that the critical electric field strength requirement for film surface roughness reduction depends strongly on the direction of the applied electric field and the film texture expressed by its surface crystallographic orientation. We also studied the effects of the deposited film thickness and the film‚Äôs surface diffusional anisotropy strength on the current-induced surface roughness reduction of face-centered cubic crystalline metallic films. We found that, in such films, {100} and {111} surfaces are easier to smoothen with electrical treatment than {110} surfaces. Our study provides a practical guidance for the optimization of the application of electric fields to accomplish surface roughness reduction of single-crystalline conducting thin films by minimizing the applied electric field strength requirement. Our study also sets the stage for analogous studies of the more complicated problem of surface roughness reduction of deposited polycrystalline conducting thin films where the fast surface diffusion directions and, in the case of polycrystalline films that are not textured, the surface crystallographic orientation vary from one grain to another.
