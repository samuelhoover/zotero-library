The protein folding ‘speed limit’
Jan Kubelka, James Hofrichter and William A Eaton
How fast can a protein possibly fold? This question has stimulated experimentalists to seek fast folding proteins and to engineer them to fold even faster. Proteins folding at or near the speed limit are prime candidates for all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. They may also have no free energy barrier, allowing the direct observation of intermediate structures on the pathways from the unfolded to the folded state. Both experimental and theoretical approaches predict a speed limit of approximately N/100 ms for a generic N-residue single-domain protein, with a proteins folding faster than b or ab. The predicted limits suggest that most known ultrafast folding proteins can be engineered to fold more than ten times faster.

Introduction
The introduction of pulsed laser techniques to trigger folding processes in nanoseconds [1] has had a major impact on experimental, theoretical and computational studies of protein folding. These new techniques have allowed the investigation of the mechanism of formation of the basic structural elements of proteins — a helices, b hairpins and loops — as well as mechanisms of formation for the fastest folding proteins [2–6]. Fast folding studies have raised new kinds of questions. One of these, first posed by Hagen et al. [7] and the subject of this review, is: how fast can a protein possibly fold or what is the folding ‘speed limit’?
The obvious significance of establishing speed limits is related to computer simulations of protein folding. In principle, much of what one would like to know about the mechanism of folding for a particular protein is contained in folding trajectories calculated using all-atom molecular dynamics. However, simulation of folding is computa
tionally intensive because many long trajectories must be calculated in order to obtain sufficient statistical sampling to describe kinetics. Proteins that fold in the shortest possible time are therefore prime candidates for such studies. The notion of a speed limit and the possibility of direct simulation by molecular dynamics have motivated several groups both to search for and design ultrafast folding proteins (tfolding < 100 ms), and to reengineer them to make them fold even faster [8–20]. The discovery of such proteins has led to direct comparisons of simulated and experimental folding kinetics [13,15,16,21–23]. Comparisons have also been made between unfolding simulations at experimentally inaccessible high temperatures and experiments at much lower temperatures [24,25].
The not-so-obvious significance is that at the speed limit the free energy barrier to folding may disappear — the ‘downhill’ folding scenario of Bryngelson et al. [14,26–29]. Downhill folding presents the possibility of obtaining much more information on the folding mechanism. For small proteins (<100 residues), it is commonly found that only two populations of molecules are observable at equilibrium — folded and unfolded [30]. In kinetic experiments on the folding of these so-called two-state proteins, no intermediates are observed and there is simply an exchange, with time, of the folded and unfolded populations (Figure 1). No direct information can be obtained on the microscopic pathways that connect the two states (in principle, this could be obtained if it were possible to resolve the state-to-state transitions in single-molecule measurements [31–33]). However, indirect information on the structure of the transition state ensemble can be obtained by measuring the relative effects of single mutations on the folding equilibrium and kinetics, and interpreting the results in terms of the extent to which the interactions of the residue in the transition state resemble those in the native state (fvalue analysis [34]). By contrast, in downhill folding there is the prospect that intermediate structures could be directly observed all along the reaction coordinate by spectroscopic methods [28] (Figure 1).
In this review we describe both experimental and theoretical approaches to predicting a protein folding speed limit, and then briefly compare results for the fastest folding proteins with each other and with molecular dynamics simulations of their kinetics.
Estimates from measured rates for structural elements
An easy method of estimating the speed limit is to assert that a protein cannot fold faster than the rate at which its

slowest forming structural element folds. With this postulate we can estimate the speed limit by considering the data for peptide fragments on the rates of forming a helices, b hairpins and loops (Table 1).
There is now a significant body of data on diffusionlimited loop formation for peptides of varying composition. The experimental methods are based on measuring the rate of contact formation from triplet-triplet energy transfer [35,36] and fluorescence quenching [37] using extrinsic probes, or by quenching of the triplet state of tryptophan by cysteine [38–42]. There is general agreement among the methods, although some differences in the results remain to be explained, such as the apparently longer times observed using the fluorescence quenching technique [37], suggesting that these measured rates are
not purely diffusion limited. Nevertheless, the vast majority of measured loop formation times are less than 0.1 ms, much faster than the formation of a helices or b hairpins of comparable length (Table 1). From this we conclude that loop formation is not rate limiting and therefore cannot by itself be a useful determinant of the speed limit.
When sequences corresponding to helices and hairpins are excised from proteins, they are almost invariably unstable [43–45]. In the case of the a helix, most folding studies have been carried out on alanine-rich peptides, because the helix propensity of alanine is the highest among the amino acids. According to helix-coil theory, the high propensity results from the smaller entropy cost of ordering alanine into a helical conformation. The consequence for the kinetics of a-helix formation is that the entropy decrease associated with nucleating a helical turn is smaller for alanine than for other amino acids [5,46]. As alanine-rich peptides are probably the fastest helix formers, the data in Table 1 suggest a speed limit of approximately 0.5 ms for a-helical proteins.
Not only is it difficult to identify isolated b hairpins from naturally occurring proteins [47,48], but also most designed hairpins do not have a tryptophan for fluorescence detection, the most common probe in kinetic studies. The first hairpin-forming peptide to be characterized in equilibrium and kinetic studies was the 16-residue fragment from the C terminus of protein GB1 [49]. This peptide exhibits twostate behavior and folds in 6 ms at 297 K. Because the GB1 hairpin forms very fast and addresses most issues concerning how a small protein folds, it has become a major benchmark for simulation studies (see the review by Gnanakaran et al. [50] for references to simulation and theoretical studies of structural elements).
Only quite recently have folding rates been reported for other hairpins. Using laser temperature jump and IR detection, Xu et al. [51] have measured the equilibrium constants and rates for two designed hairpin-forming peptides. A sequence similar to the GB1 hairpin, but containing four tryptophans instead of one (trpzip4), folds in 13 ms, whereas an unrelated sequence (peptide I) folds in 0.8 ms. Mun ̃ oz et al. (V Mun ̃ oz et al., unpublished) have studied an engineered version of the N-terminal hairpinforming peptide from ubiquitin [52]. This peptide aggregates, making the analysis more complex, but studies of the concentration dependence show that the formation rate is approximately 1/(20 ms) at 300 K.
Although the data for b hairpins are still sparse, our postulate suggests that the speed limit for all-b or ab proteins is most probably slower (possibly tenfold) than the 0.5 ms estimated for a proteins. We should point out that the rates measured for a helices and b hairpins are for relatively stable secondary structures, unlike the vast majority of protein fragments. A frequent misconception

in discussions of protein folding is that helices and hairpins have been shown to fold very fast, so that slow folding must arise from sources other than secondary structure formation. However, unstable secondary structure elements form slowly [6,53]. The scaling of the rate with stability is not yet known, but the data in Table 1 suggest a rough scaling of tfolding / Keq1/2 for a helices.
Estimates from polymer collapse theory
In order to obtain a deeper understanding of the speed limit, one would like to have a theory, as for simple bimolecular reactions in solution. Smoluchowski showed, almost 100 years ago, that the upper limit for the rate coefficient k is determined by the rate at which reactants diffuse together and derived the simple formula k 1⁄4 4pDa, where D is the sum of the diffusion coefficients of the two reactants and a is the sum of their radii at contact [54]. Debye later showed how this rate is either decreased or increased for charged reactants, depending on whether they have the same or opposite charge, respectively [54]. The analogous question for protein folding would be to ask: how fast can a polypeptide chain collapse from an unfolded, random coil configuration to an
object as compact as the native protein? This remains an important unsolved problem in polymer physics. De Gennes [55] investigated the collapse dynamics of homopolymers, but used a model that applies to polymers much longer than those considered here. Subsequently, Pitard and Orland [56] derived an expression from an approximate solution to the (Langevin) equation of motion for uncharged homopolymers of lengths relevant to proteins. The model describes collapse induced by changing the solvent and includes hydrodynamic interaction [57]. Because collapse in their model is driven by nonspecific hydrophobic forces, the authors argue that homopolymer and heteropolymer (i.e. polypeptide) collapse will be similar. The collapse time (at long times) is given by tcollapse  Za3on=T , where Z is the solvent viscosity, ao is the length of the chain segment, n is the number of segments and T is the absolute temperature [57]. The proportionality factor in this equation is complex and was not given, so no estimate of the collapse time has yet been made with this model. However, this relation does show that, in theoretically estimating speed limits for polypeptides of varying length, we should use a linear length scaling.

Estimates from reaction rate theory
Another theoretical approach to estimating the speed limit is to use Kramers’ theory of unimolecular reaction rates in solution [58–60]. Kramers’ theory assumes that the dynamics can be described by one-dimensional diffusion along a reaction coordinate in which both the reactant well (in this case, the minimum in the free energy versus reaction coordinate profile corresponding to the unfolded state) and barrier top are parabolic (Figure 1). The folding time (the reciprocal of the folding rate coefficient) is given by:
tfolding 1⁄4 2pkBT
ominomaxDmax
exp DG
kBT

 2ptcorrexp DG
kBT

(Equation 1)
where omin and omax are frequencies that characterize the curvature of the free energy profile at the unfolded well and (inverted) barrier top, respectively, Dmax is the diffu
sion constant at the barrier top, DG is the height of the free energy barrier, kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the absolute temperature (a unit mass has been assumed for the fictitious particle diffusing on this surface) (Figure 1). If omin  omax and Dmax  Dmin, the preexponential factor depends only on tcorr, the decay time of the autocorrelation function for motion in the unfolded well (tcorr 1⁄4 kBT =Dmino2
min). The accuracy of this simpler form of Kramers’ equation was tested by Socci et al. [60] using Monte Carlo simulations of folding a lattice representation of a protein, with the number of native contacts, Q, as the reaction coordinate. They obtained agreement within a factor of two between the mean folding time determined in the simulation and the mean (first passage) time calculated from tcorr(Q) for the unfolded well and the barrier height for the free energy versus Q profile, for which omin(Q)  omax(Q) is a good approximation.
The accuracy of Kramers’ equation, even for barriers as low as 2 kBT, suggests that the pre-exponential factor closely approximates the folding time in the absence of a free energy barrier. The folding time may decrease further as the free energy profile develops a steeper downhill gradient by increasing the stability (Figure 1). However, stability may come at the expense of increased transient trapping in local energy minima due to stronger non-native inter-residue interactions (landscape ‘roughness’ [26]; see also the review by Onuchic and Wolynes, this issue), with the result that the folding time may first decrease with increasing gradient and then increase [28]. This uncertainty suggests that we may tentatively identify the speed limit as the folding time when the free energy barrier first disappears and therefore simply use the predicted pre-exponential factor for this estimate.
Kramers’ equation can be used in two ways to obtain the pre-exponential factor and therefore the speed limit. One is to combine the measured folding time with theoretical
calculation of the barrier height. Mun ̃ oz and Eaton [61] used a very simple Ising-like model to calculate barrier heights from free energy profiles, with the number of ordered residues as the reaction coordinate. Their model considered only native inter-residue interactions, obtained from the contact map of the three-dimensional structure, and the entropy loss from ordering residues. A pre-exponential factor of approximately 10 ms gave the best agreement with experimental rates for 18 two-state proteins with an average length of 80 residues. Using a more extensive and rigorous analytical theory, Portman et al. [62,63] obtained a pre-exponential factor of 0.4 ms for the 80-residue monomeric l repressor from their calculation of the free energy versus Q profile. The potentially most accurate theoretical estimate of the pre-exponential factor from barrier heights and measured folding times could be derived from folding free energy surfaces obtained by exhaustive sampling of conformational space using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations [64,65]. However, there has, as yet, been no such systematic analysis.
A second method is to obtain tcorr directly from experiments. Q is not yet a measurable quantity. However, a related quantity can be measured — the decay time of the end-to-end distance (r) correlation function, tcorr(r), for the denatured state. Socci has recently found that tcorr(r)  tcorr(Q) for the same lattice simulation [60] that accurately reproduced the folding times (N Socci, personal communication). The advantage of tcorr(r) is that it can be obtained from the measured relaxation time of the Fo ̈ rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency for the denatured protein. Sadqi et al. [66] have measured tcorr(FRET) for the acid-denatured state of the 40residue protein BBL. In these experiments, a rapid change in temperature with a near-IR laser pulse causes a change in the equilibrium distribution of distances between donor and acceptor fluorophores attached to the N and C termini. Again assuming a Gaussian chain, tcorr(r)  2tcorr(FRET) [67] 1⁄4 0.12 ms at 305 K. This would lead to a speed limit for this 40-residue protein of 2ptcorr(r)  0.8 ms. Using the linear length scaling suggested by the homopolymer collapse theory [57] (also note: as tcorr(r) 1⁄4 hr2i/3Dmin(r) 1⁄4 CNNl 2/3Dmin for a Gaussian chain, tcorr(r) / N), the predicted speed limit from these experiments for a 100-residue protein is 2 ms. Interestingly, the FRET efficiency increases with increasing temperature, indicating that the polypeptide is becoming more compact, presumably as a result of stronger hydrophobic interactions at the elevated temperature. These experiments also show that tcorr(r) first decreases with increasing temperature and then increases. This effect is similar to that previously mentioned, whereby increasing the stability of the native protein in a downhill folding scenario may increase the folding time by decreasing the diffusion coefficient for motion on the free energy surface [28].

An estimate of the speed limit from the dynamics in the denatured well can be made by determining Dmin(r) in experiments on the rate of contact formation. These experiments exploit the theory of Szabo et al. [68] on the diffusion-limited rate kDþ of end-to-end contact formation measured from quenching of the tryptophan triplet state by cysteine in disordered peptides (kDþ 1⁄4
4pDmin(r)a/(2phr2i/3)3/2). The dependence of the rate on viscosity yields a diffusion coefficient Dmin(r) of 2
106 cm2s1 at 293 K for end-to-end contact formation of the disordered peptide C(AGQ)3W [40]. We can use the empirical equation of Millett et al. [69] for Rg to estimate
hr2i, assuming hr2i 1⁄4 6Rg
2 1⁄4 0.2N1.2 nm2, and find tcorr(r)
1⁄4 hr2i/3Dmin(r)  85 ns for a 100-residue protein and therefore a speed limit of 0.5 ms. There is no information yet on how Dmin(r) scales with polypeptide length, but one would expect that, if there is a dependence, it would be to decrease Dmin(r) (to produce a longer folding time) because the number of interacting residues will increase. Also, Dmin(r) would be expected to be lower for folding sequences compared to the peptide C(AGQ)3W.
Finally, a potential method for measuring tcorr(r) is from fluctuations in the FRET efficiency at equilibrium on small numbers of molecules (correlation spectroscopy) or on single molecules. Schuler et al. [31,32,67,70] have measured the variance in the FRET efficiency distribution in 1 ms snapshots of single freely diffusing unfolded protein molecules (CspTm — a 68-residue cold shock protein). By comparing the width of the FRET efficiency distribution to that of polyproline labeled with the same dyes as a control, they found that tcorr(r) < 200 ms. More recent measurements (B Schuler et al., unpublished) using a shorter observation period of 100 ms show that tcorr(r) < 30 ms, consistent with our above estimates (the limit of 30 ms, the measured folding time of 12 ms and the activation energy of 5 kBT place limits on the free energy and entropy of activation for this protein of >4 kBT and <1 kB, respectively).
Ultrafast folders and simulations
The preceding analysis suggests that the speed limit for folding a generic single-domain protein with N residues is about N/100 ms, with a-helical proteins folding slightly faster and b or ab proteins more slowly. Table 2 summarizes the data for proteins that have been measured to fold in <100 ms, as well as proteins for which folding times have been extrapolated to <100 ms (see Ivankov et al. [71] for a summary of known folding rates). The fastest folding of these proteins are a-helical, as expected from the data on structural elements. In a-helical structures, most of the stabilizing interactions are local, corresponding to hydrogen-bonding and sidechain interactions between residues separated by three residues along the sequence. In the simplest model of protein folding, a high density of local inter-residue interactions results in a larger compensation of the entropy loss as the chain becomes
ordered, and consequently a lower free energy barrier and faster folding [61,72].
Calculations of folding rates from molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out using distributed computing for three ultrafast folding proteins — BBA5 [21], the subdomain of villin [16,22] and the tryptophan cage [13,15] (references to simulation papers that do not calculate rates, as well as theoretical papers related to the specific protein are also given in Table 2, but discussion of these studies is beyond the scope of this review). The idea of distributed computing is to use the enormous amount of idle time available on PCs around the world to calculate independent trajectories. The calculation takes advantage of the fact that, for an exponential process, the fraction of molecules that fold in time t is simply t/t (for t ! t), where t is the folding time. The first protein to be studied by both distributed computing and experiment is the 23-residue designed miniprotein BBA5, consisting of a helix and a hairpin connected by a turn containing a Dproline. Using tens of thousands of volunteer processors and an implicit solvent model to reduce the computation time, Snow et al. [21] observed 16 folding events, as judged by the similarity to the known native structure. The agreement between simulated and measured rates and equilibrium constants is surprisingly good, with a measured folding time using laser temperature jump of 7.5 3.5 ms and a simulated time calculated from the fraction of successful 20 ns trajectories of 6 (3,þ7) ms (the uncertainties reflect different choices for the definition of a folded structure), and a measured equilibrium constant of 0.25 compared to the simulated value of 1 obtained from the ratio of folding and unfolding rates. The folding mechanism is not complex, consisting essentially of the docking of the helix and hairpin, with the intrinsically more stable helix usually forming first. Although there is some question as to whether this mini-protein truly folded in these trajectories (e.g. by showing that the folded conformation persists and that its mean energy is the same as that found in simulations starting with the known folded structure), the simulation produced the extremely important result that molecular dynamics simulations may soon, if they have already not done so, fold ultrafast proteins knowing only the amino acid sequence.
Distributed computing has also been used to calculate the folding rate of another designed mini-protein — the 20-residue tryptophan cage. Snow et al. determined a folding time of 2–7 ms [13], again in excellent agreement with the measured time of 4 ms at room temperature obtained by Qui et al. using laser temperature jump [15].
The 35-residue villin subdomain is the smallest naturally occurring polypeptide that folds autonomously without disulfide bonds or cofactors, and has equilibrium properties comparable to those of much larger singledomain proteins [73]. A double mutant of the subdomain of the

villin headpiece folds in 1.7 0.3 ms ([16]; J Kubelka et al., unpublished). Because of its small size and rapid folding, it has been the focus of numerous computer simulations (see references in Table 2). Using distributed computing, Zagrovic et al. [22] observed many folding events for the villin subdomain, as judged by the similarity to the known native structure. They observed 35 folding events in 6000 30 ns trajectories and therefore obtained a folding time of 5 (þ11,3) ms at 300 K, compared to the measured time using laser temperature jump of 4.3 0.6 ms for the wildtype subdomain at 300 K [16].
The difficult part of analyzing simulations is to extract information concerning the folding mechanism, which is much more complex and therefore more interesting than that of BBA5. From examination of the successful trajectories, Zagrovic et al. [22] proposed that breaking the Cterminal phenylalanine–core interaction is the ratelimiting step in folding the protein and therefore that removal of the phenyl group would eliminate this misfolded trap and increase the folding rate. However, Kubelka et al. [16] found no change in either the equilibrium constant or folding rate on replacing this phenylalanine with alanine. There are at least two possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy, in addition to the obvious criticism that the force-fields are not yet sufficiently accurate for mechanistic studies. One is that the observed folding trajectories are not representative of the shortest trajectories of an exponential distribution [74,75], because the starting structures were not taken from an equilibrium distribution in the denatured state. A second possibility is that the trajectories are representative, but the analysis of the trajectories is incomplete in that the entire unfolded ensemble was not considered [16].
There have also been comparisons of experiments and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for the FBP28 WW domain and the engrailed homeodomain. At very high temperatures (e.g. 498 K) proteins unfold in nanoseconds in simulations, making it possible to calculate unfolding trajectories using all-atom molecular dynamics including explicit solvent [24,25,76]. The most complete study has been carried out on the engrailed homeodomain [17]. The simulations suggest that the transition states are similar at several temperatures (348 K, 373 K and 498 K) above the folding temperature (325 K). However, the unfolded structures are rather different [17,25], implying that the microscopic pathways from the unfolded state to the transition state may also be significantly different. Evidence supporting the relative insensitivity of transition state structures to temperature comes from studies on a much slower folding protein, CI2, for which f-values have been calculated from the ensemble of structures identified as transition state structures and are in remarkably good agreement with experimental values [77–79]. This agreement is surprising, as the hydrophobic effect, a dominant force in folding, is highly temperature depen
dent, so it will be important to understand why transition states appear to be insensitive to temperature. The reader should consult the recent reviews by Fersht and Daggett for further discussion of the comparison of experiments and unfolding simulations [24,25].
Current record holders: potential downhill folders
As pointed out in the Introduction to this review, at the speed limit the free energy barrier to folding may disappear to produce downhill folding (Figure 1), opening up the possibility of directly observing intermediate structures all along the reaction coordinate [28]. This immediately raises two related questions concerning the ultrafast folders listed in Table 2. Which proteins are intrinsically the fastest folders and how close is each protein to its theoretical speed limit? To answer these questions, we must normalize the folding times for size and stability, as small proteins fold faster than large proteins and increasing stability almost always decreases the folding time. Normalization for stability is straightforward, assuming a linear free energy relation between rate and equilibrium constant. Using the average exponent (i.e. the f-value) of 1/3 derived from mutation studies [80], the data can be normalized with the relation tfolding / Keq1/3.
Normalization for size is more problematic. Attempts have been made to extract the length dependence of folding rates from experimental data [71,81], but the exact functional form and parameters are uncertain because of the narrow range of sizes, and the dominance of the folding rate by topology (e.g. contact order) and stability [82]. For the present, we must therefore rely on results from simulations of simplified representations of proteins, and on theoretical arguments for the length dependence of both the folding time and the speed limit. These studies predict that scaling of protein folding times with size will vary from a polynomial dependence to an exponential dependence [71,81,83–88]. Wolynes [85] has proposed that the size dependence will depend on the relation of the experimental temperature to both the folding temperature Tf and the glass transition temperature Tg (the temperature at which the kinetics become sluggish due to deep energy traps; see the review by Onuchic and Wolynes, this issue), and is polynomial for fast folders where T!Tf and T@Tg. As the temperatures for almost all of the proteins in Table 2 fall below the folding temperature, we assume polynomial scaling with a folding time proportional to N3, which is close to what has been found in several studies using lattice representations of proteins [81,84,87]. Semi-empirical relations proposed by Li et al. with t / exp(1.1N1/2) or t / exp(0.36N2/3) give slightly different results [71,81], but our qualitative conclusions are not affected.
To estimate how the folding speed limit depends on size, we used a linear length scaling. A simple argument

The protein folding ‘speed limit’ Kubelka, Hofrichter and Eaton 83

justifying a linear N dependence, in addition to those given above for the collapse time and pre-exponential factor, is based on the assumption that, at the speed limit, folding proceeds down a steep free energy gradient (Figure 1). Using the number of ordered residues as the reaction coordinate, the time to move down a steep free energy hill is simply proportional to the length of the reaction coordinate and therefore the size of the protein, N, assuming also that the diffusion coefficient does not decrease with increasing size. A simple linear proportionality is also obtained with Q as the reaction coordinate, because for small proteins the number of native contacts is also approximately proportional to N.
Table 3 shows folding times normalized for size and stability, and the proximity of the measured folding time to the speed limit for each protein. The temperatures of the measured folding times are different (Table 2), but folding times are much less sensitive to temperature than unfolding times, and change little or often decrease with increasing temperature. The designed three-helix bundle a3D [20] is the intrinsically fastest folding protein, with the naturally occurring three-helix bundle albumin binding domain [89] a close second (the same ranking is obtained with a weaker length dependence such as N2). Although topology must play a role in determining the rate of the fastest folders, there is only a weak correlation between relative contact order and the logarithm of the folding times normalized for size and stability (r 1⁄4 0.67, p 1⁄4 0.03, not including data from extrapolated folding times). Another issue in comparing folding times is the amount of native structure that is already present in the unfolded state, which is not known for the three intrinsically fastest folding proteins. Engrailed homeodomain, for example, contains a considerable amount of helix in the
unfolded state [90], so folding involves mostly docking of prenucleated helices [17,25] rather than the more complex and slower process of organizing structure from a more random unfolded state without helices [6,53,91]. Similar studies of the structure of the denatured state for the other proteins in Table 2 will therefore be important for assessing the factors that contribute to ultrafast folding.
Table 3 shows the proximity to the speed limit as measured by the ratio of the measured folding time to the speed limit of N/100 ms. This analysis makes two interesting points. First, it shows that, for most of these ultrafast proteins, there is still considerable room to speed up folding, either by stabilizing the native state using protein engineering or by changing solvent conditions. In view of our expectation that proteins with b secondary structure will fold more slowly than a-helical proteins, the two WW domains are most probably closer to their speed limit than is indicated by our estimates. Second, the analysis predicts that three of the intrinsically fastest folding proteins are folding close to their speed limit — the 73-residue designed a3D, the mutant of the 47-residue albumin binding domain and the mutant of the villin subdomain (if the extrapolated value of 5 ms for cytochrome b562 is confirmed by direct measurement, it should be added to this list). Each protein folds with exponential time courses, whereas one might expect non-exponential kinetics if the barrier is absent. However, downhill folding does not guarantee that non-exponential kinetics will be detected [92,93], raising the possibility that all three proteins may be folding without a barrier. It is interesting in this regard that most variations on the simple analytical model [61,94,95] predict barrierless folding for the villin subdomain and the albumin binding domain (a3D has not been studied with these models) (ER Henry, WA Eaton, unpublished).

Two recent experimental studies have directly addressed the issue of downhill folding. In laser temperature jump experiments, Yang et al. found that mutations of the 80residue l-repressor decrease the folding time to 20 ms and produce non-exponential kinetics and also introduce a new 2 ms kinetic phase [14]. The 2 ms phase is attributed to population of the region of the free energy barrier top, indicating that the barrier is very small and that the folding rate of these mutants is therefore approaching the speed limit. Interestingly, the analysis in Table 3 suggests that, of the ultrafast folding proteins, l-repressor is folding at a rate relatively close to its estimated speed limit (with a remaining free energy barrier of only 3 kBT), supporting the interpretation of Yang et al. [14].
Garcia-Mira et al. [29] have argued from equilibrium measurements that the 40-residue peripheral subunit binding domain from oxoglutarate dehydrogenase is a downhill folder. They coined the term ‘one-state’ folding to indicate that there is no barrier separating folded and unfolded states, but a continuum of structures from folded to unfolded. Their conclusion is based on the lack of coincidence in the temperature-dependent changes in circular dichroism, fluorescence and heat capacity. They also make the interesting speculation that downhill folders may be ‘molecular rheostats’, with biological function controlled by the distribution of partially unfolded conformations. No kinetic data were reported, but a close relative, the peripheral subunit binding domain from pyruvate dehydrogenase, is among the ultrafast folders (Table 2).
Conclusions
There are caveats to all of our estimates of a protein folding speed limit. There are still only limited data for basing a prediction on rates of secondary structure formation and the use of Kramers’ reaction rate theory contains several assumptions that require additional testing. Nevertheless, both experimental and theoretical methods lead to very similar estimates of N/100 ms for generic single-domain proteins, with a proteins folding faster than b or ab proteins. Comparison of the measured folding times with the speed limits estimated for individual proteins indicates that there is still room to engineer most of the known ultrafast folding proteins to fold more than ten times faster. As we learn more about the relation between topology and folding mechanisms, we anticipate that the speed limit for each topology class will be somewhat different, as suggested by the difference in the rate of formation of a helices and b hairpins.
There are now several folding simulations of ultrafast folding proteins, with multiple trajectories from distributed computing that allow calculation of folding rates. There is still considerable information to be extracted from these trajectories, and we have just begun to see a glimmer of what can be learned about microscopic fold
ing pathways from the unfolded to the folded state at atomic resolution. However, many more experimental tests must be made to assess the accuracy of these simulations. Nevertheless, it is clear that we are on the threshold of making major advances in our understanding of protein folding from a combination of experimental, theoretical and simulation studies of ultrafast folding proteins.
