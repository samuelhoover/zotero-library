Fundamental equations are derived which govern the electrokinetic phenomena in a dilute suspension of charged spherical mercury drops in an electrolyte solution. General expressions for the electrophoretic mobility, the conductivity and the sedimentation velocity and potential in the suspension are derived. Numerical results are displayed as functions of the {-potential and K U (where K is the Debye-Huckel parameter and a is the drop radius). There are remarkable differences between the results for mercury drops and those for spherical rigid particles. In particular, the electrophoretic mobility and sedimentation potential (the same quantity when suitably scaled, a consequence of an Onsager relation) of mercury drops are much larger than those of rigid particles for large K Q , and their maxima (occurring when KU b 1 ) are shifted to low 5-potentials (ca.75 mV in a KCl solution). Some approximate analytic formulae are also derived. It is shown that the theory of Levich and Frumkin for
the electrophoresis and sedimentation of mercury drops is valid only for very small 5 and K U >->1 and only when all the ionic species have the same drag coefficient.
In this paper we develop a theory of the electrokinetic phenomena in a dilute suspension of charged mercury drops on the basis of the Henry-Overbeek-Booth theory’-3 of the electrophoresis of rigid ,particles. The first attempt of such an extension of the Henry-Overbeek-Booth theory to the electrophoresis of liquid drops was made by Booth.4 He derived expressions for the mobility of a liquid drop with a low 6-potential in an applied electric field for various possible charge distributions in the drop. One of Booth’s assumptions is that the electric field around the drop is given by superposition of the applied field and the equilibrium double-layer field of the drop; this assumption was
originally employed by Henry’ and yields the mobility correct to order 6 in the case of insulating rigid particles. Levich and Frumkin proposed an entirely different theory of the electrokinetic phenomena of charged mercury drops with large KU (where K is the Debye-Huckel parameter and a is the drop radius), which is described in the treatise by Levich.’ This theory makes use of the Lippmann equation and some simplified boundary conditions on the drop surface. Surprisingly, however, the mobilities of mercury drops predicted by Booth’s theory4 and Levich’s and Frumkin’s theory’ show a significant difference in magnitude, i.e. Levich’s and Frumkin’s result is larger than Booth’s result by the order of
This discrepancy between the two theories was examined by Levine and O’Brien,6 who found that Booth’s assumption of the superposition of the applied and equilibrium fields is invalid for mercury drops because of the large displacement of the

charge on the drop surface. Levine and O’Brien6 tried to reproduce the theory of Levich and Frumkin’ by applying the approach of the Henry-Overbeek-Booth without recourse to the Lippmann equation and showed that these two approaches are equivalent for sufficiently small 6 and K a >> 1 (further, it must be assumed that all the ionic species have the same mobilities, as will be shown later).
However, when applied to mercury drops with arbitrary values of ‘4 and K a , the Frumkin-Levich theory5 is still unsatisfactory, since it is based on some approximations valid only for K a >> 1 and an unjustified use of the Lippmann equation [see ref. ( 6 ) ] . In the present paper we develop a general theory of the electrophoresis
of charged mercury drops without any restriction of the magnitude of K a and 6. We make exact numerical calculations using a modified computer program? first developed by O’Brien and White7for the calculation of the electrophoretic mobility of spherical rigid particles. We also obtain approximate mobility formulae for small
6 and for large K a , using approximation methods described in previous In addition to the electrophoresis problem, the present paper treats the conductivity and sedimentation in a dilute suspension of charged mercury drops. These electrokinetic properties are closely related to electrophoresis and can be described by the same fundamental equations. We extend theories of the -conductivity given by O’Brien’ and of the sedimentation developed in our recent paper” for rigid particles to mercury drops.
FUNDAMENTAL EQUATIONS
Consider a charged spherical mercury drop of radius a, mass density Pd and viscosity v d in a liquid of mass density pm and viscosity 7 containing a general electrolyte. To solve the electrophoresis, conductivity and sedimentation problems, we need the solutions to the following two problems: (1) steady motion of a charged drop with velocity U , in an applied electric field E and (2) steady motion of a charged drop with velocity USEDin a gravitational field g. For a spherical drop, U , and USEDare, respectively, parallel to E and g. Problem (1) gives solutions to the electrophoresis and conductivity problems and problem (2) is the solution to the sedimentation problem. The main assumptions in our analysis are as follows. (i) The Reynold numbers of the liquid flows outside and inside the drop are small enough to ignore inertial terms in the Navier-Stokes equation and the liquids can be regarded as incompressible. (ii) The fields E and g are weak so that the drop velocities U , and USEDare, respectively, proportional to E and g, i.e. terms of higher order in the perturbing fields may be neglected. (iii) The drop remains spherical during motion under the field E or g. This assumption is satisfied if the surface tension at the drop surface is sufficiently large. (iv) No electrolyte ions can penetrate the drop surface, which implies that no electrochemical reactions occur on the drop surface, i.e. neither neutralization of ions nor ionization of atoms of the drop takes place. This assumption is equivalent to postulating that a mercury drop behaves like an ideally polarizable conductor. Consequently we may assume that neither electrostatic charge, nor field nor current exists inside the drop and that the drop surface is always equipotential. Let the electrolyte be composed of N ionic species of valence zi, bulk concentra
tion n? and drag coefficient Ai ( i = 1,2,. ..,N ) . The origin of the spherical
coordinate system (r, 8,4 i)s held fixed at the centre of the drop and the polar axis
( 8 = 0) is put parallel to E or g. We denote the flow velocities of the liquids outside and inside the drop and that of the ith ionic species at position F by u ( F ) ,u , ( F )
t A copy of the program in Fortran is available from the authors.

In fig. 1-3 the computer results for the electrophoretic mobility Emof mercury drops in KCl are displayed as a function of 6 for various values of Ka, in comparison with those for spherical rigid particle^.^ A remarkable difference is seen between these two cases in that the mobility of mercury drops much exceeds that of rigid particles for large K a ; for example, when
e { / k T = 3 ( 5 = 75 mV), E,(mercury)/E,(rigid) is ca. 12 at K a = 100 and ca. 23 at Ka = 200. This ratio further increases with K a . For a symmetrical electrolyte, from eqn (72) we find that E,(mercury) asymptotes to

The large mobility of mercury drops arises from their finite viscosity, which gives rise to a tangential frictional force acting on the surface smaller than that for rigid particles, as has also been pointed out by Levich.'

The tangential frictional force on the drop surface is then of order 7)d U / a and hence the ratio of the mobility of a mercury drop to that of a rigid particle becomes Karl/ 7)d = K a . Another marked difference between the mobilities of mercury drops and rigid particles lies in the position of a maximum occurring in mobility curves when K a b 1 for mercury drops and KU 3 3 for rigid particks. For Ka 3 10, in particular, the mobility maximum of rigid particles o c c u ~ sat 5 = 5-6 (5== 125- 150 mV), while in
the case of mercury drops it is shifted to 5 - 3 ( 6 =75 mV) (this value being easily
accessible experimentally) and depends little on the magnitude of K a . The existence of a maximum in the mobility can be explained by the fact that as increases, the tangential flow of counter-ions in the double layer along the surface increases. This surface current tends to equalize the potential around the surface and hence retards the motion of the particle or the drop. For large KU and symmetrical electrolytes, the above effect (which is called the relaxation, the double-layer polarization or the surface c o n d ~ c t a n c e ' i~s)characterized by a factor F [eqn (SO)] for rigid particles and D [eqn (75)] for mercury drops. Roughly speaking, these parameters may be related to the ratio of the conductivity K , in the double-layer region (so-called surface conductivity) to the conductivity of the bulk electrolyte solution K", i.e. F, D = K , / aK as can be seen by calculating

the excess tangential flow I, of counter-ions in the double layer ( F corresponds to
Relintroduced by Derjaguin and Dukhin”). In the factor (1 +3m ) in the expression for F [eqn (SO)] the 3 m arises from the surface ionic flow due to the tangential liquid flow u, (ie. corresponds to the surface convection current) and the 1 arises from the flow due to the tangential gradient of the electrochemical potential, both terms being of the same order of magnitude. On the other hand, in the case of
mercury drops, as the tangential liquid flow u, is of ’order I U,l= a(K U ) the contribution of the surface-convection term exceeds that of the other term by the order of KU, i.e. the surface current I, on the drop is caused mainly by convection of counter-ions. This explains why D is independent of KU (and hence why the position of the mobility maximum of mercury drops is insensitive to the magnitude of KU for large K U ) while F is proportional to 1 / K U . Thus F becomes zero as KU -+ a, corresponding to the well known fact in the case of rigid particles that at_infinite KU (for fixsd 5) the relaxation effect vanishes. Also, the fact that F = exp (5/2) and
D =exp ( 5 ) explains the shift of the mobility maximum of mercury drops to small
As mentioned earlier, the increase in surface current I , with 5 tends to equalize the potential around the drop (or the particle), which, in turn, suppresses further increase in I,. Therefore, the actual surface conductance for large KU is not propor
tional to D (or F ) but to D / (1 + 0 )[or F / ( 1 +F ) ] ,as will be discussed again later.
It is of interest to note (from fig. 1-3) that for very high 5 the mobility of mercury drops tends to that of rigid particles. In other words, mercury drops behave like rigid particles as 5 -+ co (except for two singular cases KU = 0 and a)because, for
very high 5, the surface current I, on the mercury drop has its convection component (of order KCZ)fully suppressed and becomes of the same order as I , for rigid particles. Indeed, as 5 -+ a,both of the large KU formulae for mercury drops [eqn (72)] and rigid particles [eqn (79)] tend to the same limiting value:
potentials.
This ‘solidification’ effect of mercury drops at high 5 occurs not only for electrophoresis but also for other electrokinetic phenomena (conductivity and sedimentation), as will be seen later. For the special case of the sedimentation velocity at KU >> 1, Levich’ has already pointed out the above effect. In fig. 4 we compare the approximate results, eqn (61) and (72), with the computer results for mercury drops. The small-5 formula [eqn (61)] is_foundto be a good approximation with relative errors less than a few percent for 5 s 1.5. The large-Ka formula [eqn (72)], on the other hand, shows excellent agreement with the computer
results at any values of 5 for large KU. The relative error F in eqn (72) is cegligible ( & < l % ) for K u a l O O ; ~ ~ 2 a2t ~%u = 5 0 e;ven at Ku=lO, F = s ~ % for 5 ~ 4 .We note that in the brackets on the right-hand side of eqn (72) the first term (linear in K U ) corresponds to the correct large-Ku limiting form [eqn (78)],_the sesond term becomes dominant and exceeds the first term for very high l[exp ([/2) 2 KU],
and the contribution from the third term becomes large fo_rlow 5. [This term yields
Smolchowski’s formula for rigid particles, Em= sgn (5)3[/22, in the limit qfd - W.]
Fig. 4 also shows the mobility of mercury drops calculated by the formula of Levich and Frumkin,’ which is, in our notation,

The difference K " - K" due to the presence of charged spheres results from two effects: (1) the decrease in conductivity due to the presence of non-conducting spheres (note that although mercury drops are conducting, no currents exist inside the drops because of their perfect polarization) and (2) the increase in conductivity due to the surface conductivity K,, which is, for large K a , characterized by the parameter D [eqn (77)] for mercury drops and by F [eqn (SO)] for rigid particles, as discussed earlier. The value of ( K " - K " ) / # X " = -312 at (= 0 in fig. 5 corresponds to effect ( I 1 and so does the first term in each of the approximate formulae [eqn (64) and (7311. Fig. 5 shows a remarkable difference in the behaviour at K a +00 between mercury drops and rigid particles; i.e. as K a + a,the conductivity of the suspension of rigid particles becomes independent of (, while the conductivity of the mercury-drop

For the case of rigid particles, the surface conductance effect (the relaxation effect) vanishes as K U - + 0 and as KU-+ a,and hence UsED(rigid)+ UzzD, which is independent of [, in these limits. On the other hand for mercury drops, as the surface conductivity does not vanish as KU + 00, the [-dependence of USEDremains in this limit and Us,, tends to its limiting form [eqn (74)] (for symmetrical electrolytes) as

SEDIMENTATION POTENTIAL
It has been seen that the small-c formula [eqn (70)] and large-rca formula [eqn (75)] for the sedimentation field EsEDsatisfy the Onsager relation [eqn (7l)] between electrophoresis and sedimentation. Further, we have confirmed that the computer results also satisfy the Onsager relation within the computer accuracy. Thus if the sedimentation field EsEnis scaled as
the quantity E gEDbecomes identical numerically with the scaled electrophoretic mobility Em[eqn (62)]. The Onsager relation [eqn (71)] was originally proved by de Groot et all3 on the basis of irreversible thermodynamics, and in the previous paper'' we have given a direct proof without recourse to irreversible thermodynamics which is applicable for both mercury drops and rigid particles.

Noting that the integrand of each of eqn (A.2), (A.3) and (43) rapidly decays as r increases and is zero outside the double layer, we may expand r in the integrand around a and regard ( r - a ) / a to be of order l/rca. In addition to this result we use the fact that 4 * ( a )>> A+*( r ) in the double-layer region for large KQ, as will be made explicit later, and the following large-rca approximate formula for y correct to order 1/Ka [which is obtained from eqn (49) of ref.

The large-Ku formulae for Emand Us,, [eqn (72) and (74)] can be obtained by substituting eqn (A.4) and (A.7)-(A.11) into eqn (44b)and (49b), respectively, and retaining their leading terms.
