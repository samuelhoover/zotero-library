NATO and the Korean War: A Context
WALTER LAFEBER*
The Korean War "was a turning point in the history of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)] alliance," according to the leading U.S. historian of that alliance, because the conflict led to a "massive increase" in U.S. military assistance (including the commitment of American troops in 1951), the restructuring of NATO's organization, and the expansion of the alliance's "geographic shape" with the inclusion of Greece, Turkey, and the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of the war, moreover, "the German question was revived and acquired an urgency that had been lacking before June 25, 1950." All that is true, of course, although it may be suggested that these turning points had roots that reached back months before the beginning of the Korean War. It may also be suggested that the U.S. policies that transformed NATO were reactions less to the war than to a deeper, systemic crisis that Washington policymakers believed had been developing and threatening their foreign policies for more than a year.1 The conflict in Korea was a watershed in the history of American postwar foreign policy, but like all watersheds, it had indispensable tributaries. The war did not mark an abrupt break or turn in President Harry S. Truman's foreign policy plans, but formed part of a continuum that had its more important origins ten months earlier when the Soviets exploded their first atomic device and it became clear, with the writing of the State Department White Paper, that the United States had to accept the conquest of China by the Communists. So too, important changes in the NATO alliance did not suddenly become real after June 1950,2 but had begun in the fall and

winter of 1949 when (despit Western interests—an absenc experts) the United States began policy. That restructuring prod we have since known it.
This essay also advances a corollary argument—that one of the key changes in the perception of NATO by American and West European officials was a new, evolving relationship between the alliance in Europe and Western interests elsewhere around the globe. The history of how Washington policymakers and, at times, European leaders tried to use NATO to resolve problems beyond the alliance is instructive, and that theme too became obvious in the months before the outbreak of the Korean War.
NATO's primary importance has not been as a military alliance to stop a probable Soviet invasion, but as a means to deal with more immediate problems—the integration of the Federal Republic of Germany into the West, the easing of Franco-German hatreds, the anchoring of a Great Britain tossed between continental and Atlantic-Commonwealth interests, and the solution of a systemic economic crisis that preoccupied officials in both Western capitals and Moscow in 1949. Early in that year, however, Secretary of State Dean Acheson expressed great optimism about the alliance. Praising the changing French attitude toward the Germans, Acheson told an executive session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May that France accepted West Germany's integration into the rest of Europe "solely and only on account of the North Atlantic treaty." When asked whether NATO had given Europe confidence against a resurgent Germany, he responded, "Yes. It works in all directions." From the U.S. perspective, moreover, it worked cheaply. Americans, led by President Truman himself, believed that the major U.S. contribution to NATO consisted of financial aid and a number of atomic bombs controlled by the U.S. Air Force. As a British Foreign Office minute warned in June 1949, such a belief was "to some extent ... an extension of old isolationist feeling in that the idea of strategy based on inter-continental bombers with the U.S.A. having a monopoly of such bombers and of the atom bomb, will prevent Americans having to fight another land war in Europe."3 By late August iy4y, tx)th Acheson s optimism and the old isolationist feeling" were badly shaken. The imminent conquest of China by the Communists posed problems for NATO nations' interests in Asia, problems that Washington had largely ignored just months earlier. The Soviet atomic explosion resulted in an earlier-than-expected end to the U.S. monopoly. And the Marshall Plan, which was to restore the economic health of Western Europe, was not working rapidly enough. "We are faced with a terribly serious world situation, a world financial situation," Truman told his top

Acheson privately doubted that unilateral U.S. private investment could do the job. Investors were too skittish about the safety of their funds. The old days were over: "In China when things got rough we'd just send in a gunboat and shell hell out of them to protect our holdings." But now, he added, "We must realize that the U.S. is in a helluva fix today. The United States needs allies." Those allies, moreover, as he told Congress in August 1949, were discovering that "economic measures alone are not enough." Economic recovery requires "a sense of security," and such security in turn demands a tum bellet m the ability ot the tree nations to detend themselves against armed aggression. Such a belief is notably lacking in Western Europe today." The Europeans must increase their defense, "largely by their own effort," so "economic recovery" could proceed. But Acheson's insight clashed with Truman's determination to maintain a roughly $13 billion defense budget. The president informed his budget aides and key cabinet members in July 1949 that he wanted a "balanced program," and added that "it was never

These officials were becom German problem in the aftermath of the Sov of 1949, Acheson had assured Congress demilitarization of Germany must be compl November ("some three months after the Soviet exDlosion). he denied that the
State Department had under consideration any plans for a West German role in West European defenses. At the same time, however, the U.S. embassy in Moscow warned Acheson and Truman that "in view of favorable
developments on the atomic energy and China fronts the Embassy believes that Moscow may consider this an opportune time to regain the initiative on the German question," although the embassy was not certain how Stali would approach this problem. Meanwhile, U.S. military officials told their British counterparts that in case of Soviet attack, it was doubtful tha American forces would be able to reach the Rhine in time to be helpful. Th Pentagon, led by its Joint War Plans branch, began to develop an all-ou program for German remilitarization at the very moment Acheson wa denying such an eventuality. British military planners, inspired by remar of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, decided in December 1949 that a ne German army could be formed "within the North Atlantic Treaty, whilst th other [NATO] Powers would be responsible for the navy and air force. German arms industry would, however, be required for the equipment of th German army." The West Germans were not slow to pick up on thes developments. Significantly, about three weeks after Acheson visited West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in November 1949 (a visit in which th American gently hinted that a German defense contribution might well b expected), Adenauer began mapping the political strategy for rebuilding h nation's military units and placing them within an integrated European arm As Adenauer later recalled: "Rearmament might be the way of gaining ful sovereignty for the Federal Republic. This made it the essential question of our political future."9

As Ach earlv December 1949. he was disturbed about rearmament rumors because
they were "interfering with the main task before all of us which was the integration of Germany into the European scene. The rearmament of Germany was not part of this integration and the talk was disturbing and upsetting." Or as Acheson told his close friend, British Ambassador Oliver Franks, in November: "the boys" in the State Department had given much thought to "a real French-German rapprochement, economic and political," so Germany could remain with the West and have "an economic outlet in Western Europe. She had to have one somewhere." Acheson "did not object to the suggestion," as Franks reported the conversation, "that he wanted the work of Charlemagne redone after 1,000 years."10 Acheson's analysis was echoed at private study sessions of the New York Council on Foreign Relations in which Paul Nitze (Kennan's replacement as director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff) and Frank Altschul (a CFR leader and chair of General American Investors Corporation on Wall Street) took the initiative. The two men agreed that, in Altschul's words, the "Marshall Plan will not achieve what was expected of it by 1952." A new plan was required.

This is very bad from the point of view of th European economy as a whole, and for the prospects of American exports."11 The fear of 1948-49 that without the shield of NATO the Marshall Plan would be ineffective had somehow become neatly reversed. Now the argument developed that the Marshall Plan faced such danger that truly building up NATO conventional forces as an offset to the Soviet possession of the atomic secret might smash Western recovery plans. The deeper systemic problem had to be resolved, in part through Franco-German economic cooperation if possible, for only then could the military problems

During an October discussion Jawaharlal Nehru, Kennan and Acheson indeed required. Despite the Truman Doctri two Americans believed "that our actions since World War II had not been
based on any broad global plan, but that, to the contrary, a great deal of improvisation had been necessary." Or as Acheson recalled the crisis some five years later, the Soviet bomb "changed everything . . . and within a month [Truman] had put the machinery of government into operation to work things out." The result, Acheson observed, was NSC-68. "This is the fundamental paper that still governs the thing; it's the basic thing." Drawn up under Nitze's supervision during the first four months of 1950, NSC-68 approached NATO and the Western European problems by noting how threats to Western Europe through the buildup of Soviet war reserves and arsenal capabilities could be neutralized (at least in part) by the implementation of the Marshall Plan and the 1949 Mutual Defense Assistance Act. But "unless the military strength of the Western European nations is increased on a much larger scale than under current programs and at an accelerated rate, it is more than likely that those nations will not be able to oppose even by 1960 the Soviet armed forces in war with any degree of effectiveness." An "essential element in a program to frustrate the Kremlin design is the development of a successfully functioning system among the free nations," including economic aid and military assistance to NATO allies.13
European integration, however, remained a prerequisite. NSC-68 argued that as the Marshall Plan neared its end, there was no "possibility of achieving ... a satisfactory equilibrium with the dollar area. [Western Europe] has also made very little progress toward 'economic integration,'

which would in the long run ten an economic environment con pivotal point: "In particular, t does not appear to be rapid e adequate economic opportuniti buildups had to occur rapidly or a result of frustration or of Soviet intimidation drift into a course of
neutrality eventually leading to Soviet domination. If this were to happen in Germany the effect upon Western Europe and eventually upon us might be catastrophic." Avoiding such a crisis required both a military budget that would quadruple from its current $13 to $14 billion level and an alliance that rested on economic integration and a carefully planned military buildup.14 As Nitze began drafting NSC-68, Acheson returned to basics in a closed door session with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Soviets' "aggressive imperialistic attitude" had of course to be discussed, but "even if there were no Russia, if there were no communism, we would have very grave problems in trying to exist and strengthen those parts of the free world which have been so badly shaken by the... two wars and the consequences of both of them." The subtlety of that problem, and threat of its long-term costs, posed grave dangers for Acheson and for NATO's prospects as well. Those dangers were now increased because the Soviets, in the words of a British analyst, had apparently decided in early 1950 "in favour of creating a détente in the hope of relaxing American hostility."15 It seemed that Truman and Acheson could not, as they had so successfully during the Greco-Turkish dilemma of 1947, point to imminent Soviet expansion as a means of prying more military and economic aid out of Congress. The administration indeed ran into strong domestic opposition to its budding plans in early 1950. In a widely noted speech in January, the distinguished columnist Walter Lippmann asserted that Tito's defection from Stalin's bloc and the appearance of India, Pakistan, and Indonesia as independent nations meant that the "two coalitions" were breaking up.

Moreover, the Soviet A-bomb explosion "has changed the balance of military power" and reinforced in "the exposed and vulnerable countries around the periphery of the Soviet Union . . . their natural impulse to disassociate themselves from the two coalitions." Consequently "western Germany cannot become a military ally of the West, as Field Marshal Montgomery so fondly hopes, because Britain and America cannot with certainty and effectiveness promise to defend Western Germany against Russian aerial attack." The Germans would develop a "middle position" between the two superpowers. Japan would assume a similar position for similar reasons. Lippmann warned that the United States must not "resist

By May, U.S. aid missions were established in the region.19 Acheson went into Vietnam with his eyes open. By the end of March 1950 he was telling the Foreign Relations Committee, behind closed doors, that the situation required the United States to pressure the French to act more intelligently, but "the thing that we have to be careful about is that we do not press the French to the point where they say, 'All right, take over the damned country. We don't want it,' and put their soldiers on ships and send them back to Europe. The Western alliance was making claims on U.S. policy that had not been evident before August 1949. In May 1950, Acheson flew to London and pleaded with the British government for more help in building up defenses. In a pessimistic analysis of the situation, the secretary of state worried that unless something was done, "there was a danger that some of the weaker and more exposed countries now in the western camp might, when a crisis arose, change sides." Without mentioning NSC-68, Acheson declared that the United States was preparing to do much more, but it needed help from its friends.20 Prime Minister Clement Attlee and Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin responded that when the time arrived that Great Britain could do without aid, it might be possible to consider giving more aid to others. The British, indeed, were entertaining quite other ideas than using the NATO alliance as a cockpit from which to guide policies in other parts of the world.

Neither the Americans nor the British
intended to make any quick commitment to the plan. British Cabinet members agreed "that it showed a regrettable tendency to move away from the conception of the Atlantic community and in the direction of European federation." Although key British and U.S. officials wanted West Germany closely integrated into Europe, the process had to include close non-French supervision. Integration before rearmament had to have certain qualities.23 The Pentaeon. however, was less narticular. U.S. Armv nlanners nushed
forward their blueprint for rearming West Germany, and on 30 April 1950 the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved it. The chiefs then wisely decided to delay their request for approval from Truman, who strongly opposed such a plan. In public statements during May and June, JCS Chairman General Omar Bradley pointedly observed that in the wake of the Soviet atomic bomb blast, conventional forces were urgently needed. The NATO Council meeting in May supported Bradley. Winston Churchill had already stated in the House of Commons that Germany should be rearmed within a European force. (Churchill's comment provoked a strong public response from Bevin that included the phrase "The Hitler revolution did not change the German character very much. It expressed it.") When the Joint Chiefs tried to play on this growing public debate by proposing to raise the issue at the NATO conference, the State Department solit. Acheson finallv decided the issue had
to be delayed. On 5 and 6 June 1950, however, even Acheson and Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson admitted to a congressional committee that European conventional forces were "totally inadequate." Bradley further testified that "I think we must all admit that the security of Western Europe would be strengthened if [the West Germans] were included in iL" He quickly added that he understood the political considerations that had to be resolved "with all the angles considered."24 Three weeks later, on 25 June 1950, those political considerations radically changed. But it should be emphasized that some of the politics, not

Despite Marshall's offer, the privately termed "some half-hearted supp Luxembourgers," stood out firmly against Germany.30 Paris responded with the Pleven Plan that proposed German force integration at the smallest possible unit. The new force would be under a European minister of defense and responsible to a European assembly. British and American officials concluded that, in the words of the Foreign Office, "French policy is, in fact, directed against the North Atlantic Treaty organization." The Foreign Office noted a speech made by Schuman in Strasbourg on 24 November: "the Atlantic Pact has a temporary aim. The European Army in our view is a permanent solution and must ensure peace against all threats, internal and external, now and in the future." It needs to be underlined that U.S. policy was running in exactly the opposite direction. ror example, three days alter Schuman spoke, a special presidential commission reported in Washington that it was not only necessary to build rapidly "the defense capabilities of Western Europe" with full U.S. participation, but to accomplish that goal the United States had also to ensure that the Europeans could obtain badly needed "raw material sources" and not "lose the sources of these needed raw materials to the forces of

bargaining lever to negotiate an end to the terror in the near future. After the Soviets asked for a foreign ministers' conference in December 1950 to discuss the West German question, Acheson, in a heated discussion with Bevin, argued that there was nothing to discuss—at least not until Western power had been built up. Bevin's pointed reminder of what had occurred in 1939 when the West was slow to talk with Stalin about the German question was to no avail. Acheson won the argument, as he did again in 1952 when

One special lesson was that although it proved not difficult to gain the attention of Americans and Western Europeans w they were attacked or seemed threatened after June 1950, it proved difficult build the alliance during periods of less or little tension. Such a probl however, did not prevent Acheson and Pentagon planners from pushing th programs for the alliance forward between August 1949 and June 1950, n did the difficulty restrain Acheson and Truman from making a histo commitment to Indo-China for the sake, in part, of NATO's cohesi During these months, moreover, U.S. officials assumed that economic and political interests, especially as those interests became embodied in t integration of the Western European economies, assumed higher priority th did military interests. The economic integration of West Germany was t prerequisite for its military integration into Western Europe. The massive U.S. military buildup after June 1950 has been viewed as ready excuse for the Soviets, who accelerated their own armament program In that sense, the West's buildup was indeed self-defeating.35 The roots o that buildup, it must be emphasized, formed not during the Korean War b especially in the ten months before the conflict when key Washingt officials, led bv Acheson. concluded that whether or not Stalin's armies
threatened to march, the economic and political, as well as the military, crises triggered by the events of late summer 1949 revealed fundamental problems in the American foreign policy system, and those problems required a restructuring of that policy. The restructuring had to occur, moreover, at a moment when there was little public consensus that costly sacrifices and traumatic shifts in the system's relationships were needed. This was not the last time U.S. officials faced a set of problems that required the reshaping of NATO, but a set in which the debate over NATO was a manifestation of more fundamental problems within both the Western system and U.S. foreign policy.
