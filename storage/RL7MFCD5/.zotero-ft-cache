Abstract: This work describes an improved version of the original OPLS–all atom (OPLS–AA) force field for carbohydrates (Damm et al., J Comp Chem 1997, 18, 1955). The improvement is achieved by applying additional scaling factors for the electrostatic interactions between 1,5- and 1,6-interactions. This new model is tested first for improving the conformational energetics of 1,2-ethanediol, the smallest polyol. With a 1,5-scaling factor of 1.25 the force field calculated relative energies are in excellent agreement with the ab initio-derived data. Applying the new 1,5-scaling makes it also necessary to use a 1,6-scaling factor for the interactions between the C4 and C6 atoms in hexopyranoses. After torsional parameter fitting, this improves the conformational energetics in comparison to the OPLS–AA force field. The set of hexopyranoses included in the torsional parameter derivation consists of the two anomers of D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-galactose, as well as of the methyl-pyranosides of D-glucose, D-mannose. Rotational profiles for the rotation of the exocyclic group and of different hydroxyl groups are also compared for the two force fields and at the ab initio level of theory. The new force field reduces the overly high barriers calculated using the OPLS–AA force field. This leads to better sampling, which was shown to produce more realistic conformational behavior for hexopyranoses in liquid simulation. From 10-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of -D-glucose and -D-galactose the ratios for the three different conformations of the hydroxymethylene group and the average 3JH,H coupling constants are derived and compared to experimental values. The results obtained for OPLS–AA–SEI force field are in good agreement with experiment whereas the properties derived for the OPLS–AA force field suffer from sampling problems. The undertaken investigations show that the newly derived OPLS–AA–SEI force field will allow simulating larger carbohydrates or polysaccharides with improved sampling of the hydroxyl groups.

Introduction
Polysaccharides as well as even simple monosaccharides are challenging molecules to model due to their numerous highly flexible and polar OH groups. By forming intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds these groups determine the conformational space sampled.1 Using a simple force field with atom centered charges is a necessary compromise in accuracy for performing time consuming molecular dynamics (MD) studies in which the solvent is treated explicitly.2 The force fields available to study biomolecular systems consist of very similar potential energy functions, and are converging to the same approach regarding the derivation of force field parameters. The nonbonded parameters are adjusted to reproduce the physical properties of pure liquids such as the heat of vaporization and the density. Following this approach, it is necessary to represent the polarized liquid state in an average way. This is achieved
by using 10 –20% larger charges than necessary to reproduce the gas phase molecular dipole moments.3,4 The torsional parameters are fit to reproduce the gas phase conformational energetics, usually derived with ab initio methods, of fragments or model systems representing the chemical environment of the torsional angle under consideration. This allows incorporating stereoelectronic effects in the otherwise pure mechanical force field model. The force fields derived with these two key elements have been found to obtain excellent free energies of solvation and free energies of binding.5

Force field parameter developments for studying carbohydrates in the condensed phase are rare6–15 in comparison to parameter developments for proteins and other simple organic molecules. The latest AMBER13 force field uses partial charges generated from a least-square fit to an ab initio calculated electrostatic potential, which is done for multiple D-glucose conformations (RESP fitting).16 When only two glucose conformations are used for the fitting a larger partial charge (O: 0.68 e, H: 0.46 e) is obtained on oxygen atoms of hydroxyl groups, whereas when 12 conformations are used smaller charges (O: 0.54 e, H: 0.37 e) are obtained. The charge set with the smaller charge on oxygen atoms is then used for the derivation of torsional parameters and in liquid simulations. The larger charge is in the order of a partial charge used on a hydroxyl oxygen atom in the AMBER or the OPLSAA17 force fields for simple monofunctional alcohols. The smaller charge assigned to carbohydrates will therefore lead to smaller interaction energies and therefore also to weaker solvation and binding. This could lead to artifacts in studies where a carbohydrate is bound to a receptor with several monofunctional hydroxyl groups. The nonbonded parameters for carbohydrates of the OPLS–AA force field are derived by studying the liquid properties of 1,2ethanediol.18 With these parameters the experimental values for the heat of vaporization and density of the pure liquid are reproduced. The charges on the hydroxyl functionality (O: 0.7 e, H: 0.435 e) are slightly larger than those of monofunctional alcohols (O: 0.683 e, H: 0.418 e). Even larger charges had to be used to describe the pure liquid properties of glycerol (O: 0.73 e, H: 0.465 e).19 This indicates that the longer the polyolic chain of the monomer is, the larger the polarization effects in the pure liquid become. The magnitude of these charges are all within the range of those obtained from HF/6-31G* CHELPG fittings to reproduce the electrostatic potential and therefore similar to those of the GLYCAM force field.12 The torsional parameters of the OPLS–AA force field9 are also fit to reproduce the conformational energetics derived with ab initio calculations. In contrast to the latest AMBER force field13 not only D-glucose but also D-galactose and D-mannose are used to obtain a wider applicable set of parameters. The derivation of the torsional parameters for the CHARMM force field14 follows a different concept. Only fragments, such as 1,2-ethanediol or hydroxymethanol, featuring the chemically different torsional environments of a hexopyranoses are used. However, it is questionable if with those torsional parameters the conformational energetics of intact hexopyranoses can be reproduced. Force field parameters have also been tested and refined against crystal structure data.7,8 To successfully predict crystal structures, the intermolecular interactions have to be in balance with the intramolecular interactions and refined to describe the condensed phase accurately. van Eijck and Kroon developed a program (UPACK) for the generation of crystal structures by means of energy minimization, and have recently compared the results of three all atom force fields with geometric and energetic criteria.8 The OPLS–AA was heralded as the most promising all-atom force field. This indicates that the energetics described with the OPLS–AA force field is already rather refined. Unfortunately, these investigations do not give any information about the dynamical behavior.
Despite the promising results obtained for the OPLS–AA force field so far, large discrepancies in reproducing the gas phase relative energies are found as well. The relative energies of the two conformations with which the exo-anomeric effect is represented, cannot be reproduced (Fig. 1).9 A large energy discrepancy of about 4 kcal/mol is also observed when the two 1,2-ethanediol conformations are considered which represent the same difference in geometry. One factor contributing to this discrepancy originates from the fact that the electrostatic 1,4-interactions are reduced by a factor two, which causes an imbalance with the 1,5-interactions (Fig. 1). The discrepancy between the force field and the ab initio calculated relative energy is caused by the inclusion of the mean field approximation used to describe the polarized liquid state. With smaller charges on the hydroxyl functionality the ab initio gas phase energetics could be much better reproduced, whereas with the larger charges as derived for glycerol the discrepancy is increased. The too high energy of nonhydrogen bonded structures as shown in Figure 1 for 1,2-ethanediol lead in hexopyranoses to very high barriers for rotation of the hydroxyl group, which leads to sampling problems in Monte Carlo simulations using explicit solvent.20 Such sampling problems make it impossible to accurately study the conformational behavior of carbohydrates. The OPLS–AA force field has also been used to study the conformational space of -D-Manp-(1-3)--D-Glcp-Ome disaccharide in explicit water and DMSO.21 The same systems were also run with the GLYCAM force field for carbohydrates for which similar results are obtained. Surprisingly, no sampling problems are reported using the OPLS–AA force field. Rather, fast oscillations between g and g conformations with respect to the HCOH torsions are observed.

In this article we describe the development of a new version of the OPLS–AA force field for carbohydrates. We are aiming to improve the largest discrepancies of the conformational energetics obtained for the OPLS–AA force field and to better reproduce the high energy conformations with broken intramolecular hydrogen bonds which are populated most in aqueous solution. This is done by applying an additional scaling factor for the 1,5- and specific 1,6-interactions, which reduce the strength of the electrostatic interactions in hexopyranoses and 1,2-ethanediol. Because these additions change the strength of the intramolecular nonbonded interaction, the torsional parameters are reoptimized. The resulting parameter set is then tested in the liquid phase for obtaining better sampling and for reproducing experimentally derived 3JH,H coupling constants. With an improved sampling obtained for hexopyranoses, larger carbohydrates could be studied by simulating for several nano- or microseconds in explicit solvent as has been successfully done for peptides22 and proteins.23 The liquid phase simulations reported here demonstrate that the improved gas phase energetics of the newly developed force field leads to a more realistic solvation and conformational behavior of hexopyranoses in aqueous solution.
Computational Methods
Ab initio and Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
Ab initio and DFT calculations are performed using the GAUSSIAN94 program.24 For 1,2-ethanediol, all structures are optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G** level of theory. It has been found for this molecule that B3LYP/6-311G** gives similar results to those obtained using a very high level of quantum theory.25,26 Introduction of a diffuse function into the basis set, which significantly reduces the basis set superposition error (BSSE) in the hydrogen bonding energy calculation, leads to better potential energy surfaces of carbohydrates.1 Thus, the 6-311G** basis set is chosen for our work. Ten conformations are reported to represent true minima for 1,2-ethanediol.27 For the torsional parameter fitting, further rotamers are generated. For the conformations with a O–C–C–O torsion () gauche and trans, rotamers in 30° increments of the C–C–O–H torsional angle 1 are generated, whereas the angle 2 is fixed at 180° (Fig. 2). For hexopyranose, the many conformations are available from the work of Damm et al.,9 which are obtained via full geometry optimizations using RHF theory and the 6-31G* basis set. The HF-6-31G* level of theory is known to be adequate for glucose conformations and can only be improved at an unattainable com
putational expense considering the number of conformations used.28 Our additional electronic structure calculations for deriving further hexopyranose conformations are therefore also performed at the RHF/6-31G* level, which has been used previously for developing torsional parameters.29
Force Field Studies
The OPLS–AA potential energy functions and parameters are used9 with the exception of the torsional parameters, which are newly derived, and the additional scaling factors used. The 1,5electrostatic interactions are reduced for 1,2-ethanediol and for hexopyranoses by a factor 1.25 and 1.26, respectively. In addition, for hexopyranoses a scale factor equal to 1.22 is applied between the 1,6-interacting atoms of the hydroxymethylene and the vicinal hydroxyl groups (Fig. 3). This scaling factor is necessary to restore the balance with the 1,5-interactions. Molecular mechanics calculations are performed with the GROMOS96 package30 that was adapted to reduce the 1,4-, 1,5-, and 1,6-electrostatic interactions. For geometry optimizations in GROMOS96, the conjugate-gradient algorithm is used with a convergence criterion of 1  105 kJ/mol. The POTENT program31 is modified in order to provide the molecular topology file with the OPLS–AA parameters for the GROMOS96 program. In addition to the standard OPLS–AA parameter data file, only atomic coordinates and OPLS atom types are required for the input file. The following conditions are used for each simulation. Each system consists of a single -D-hexopyranose surrounded by water in a cubic box subject to periodic boundary conditions to eliminate edge effects. For water the TIP3P model32 is used. The shortest distance between the hexopyranose and the wall of the box is initially 1.2 nm, where the number of water molecules varied from 580 to 600, depending on the hexopyranose molecule and the initial conformation. The simulations are performed at 1-atm pressure and 300 K by weak coupling33 to an external bath using the coupling constants of 0.1 ps for the temperature and 0.5 ps for the pressure coupling.

tions is used and a nonbonded pair list is updated every 5 MD steps. After a minimization of the entire system, a 100-ps MD simulation is performed with restraining the solute degrees of freedom to relax the surrounding solvent molecule, and to attain a well solvated equilibrium system. Following this, the sampling period or analysis period is performed and configurations are stored every 0.5 ps. Averages for 3JHH coupling constants are calculated using a generalized Karplus equation:34

The factors of electronegativity ( xi) are set 1.3 (O5 and O6) and 0.4 (C4). Mean values for torsional angles of the hydroxymethylene group are determined according to the following procedure. A conformation is considered g if the torsion value is between 0 and 120 degrees, t if the value is between 120 and 240 degrees, g if the value is between 240 and 360 degrees.
Torsional Parameter Optimization
The FITGR program (a GROMOS adapted version of FITPAR program35) is used to derive the torsional parameters. The heart of the FITGR routine is identical to the FITPAR routine. A difference function between the ab initio and molecular mechanics energies is constructed among a set of structures and then minimized by torsional parameters variation using the combination of a simplex and Fletcher–Powell algorithm. In contrast to FITPAR, FITGR reads the GROMOS topology and the two GROMOS geometry optimization output files containing the atomic coordinates and potential energy. The introduction of the new scale factor for the 1,5- and 1,6-electrostatic interaction changes the nonbonded intramolecular potential. Following the procedure described previously9 the set of torsional parameters optimized for the OPLS–AA force field is adjusted. This set of torsional parameters is augmented by additional types (see below).
Results and Discussion
1,2-Ethanediol
In the following section we discuss the development of the OPLSAA–SEI (OPLS–AA Scaling Electrostatic Interaction) force field and compare the gas phase energetics obtained from the ab initio and force field calculations using 1,2-ethanediol. In Table 1 the relative energies and the torsional angles (, 1, 2 see Fig. 2) obtained for the 10 possible minima and the calculated rotamers are given. The relative energies obtained for the 10 minima at the B3LYP/6-311G** level of theory are very close to the MP2 energies obtained by Cramer and Truhlar,27 which confirms the quality of the additional rotamers. The OPLS–AA and newly optimized OPLS–AA–SEI torsion parameters are given in Table 2. The torsional parameters describ
ing the O–C–C–O torsion with a single V1 term did not optimally describe the energetics of 1,2-ethanediol with the OPLS–AA–SEI electrostatic model. Thus, a set of three Fourier coefficients has been used in the fitting. The relative energies for the 1,2-ethanediol conformers and rotamers are calculated using the standard OPLS–AA parameters, the OPLS–AA–SEI parameters and at ab initio level. The results are given in Table 1 and depicted in the rotational profile of Figure 4. The RMSD between the ab initio and the force field calculated relative energies for all conformers is 0.07 and 0.51 kcal/mol for the OPLS–AA–SEI and the standard OPLS–AA, respectively. The range of energies spanned by the conformers is ca. 5.5 kcal/mol for the ab initio and the OPLS–AA–SEI models and about 10 kcal/mol for the standard OPLS–AA. The energy of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the two hydroxyls is evaluated by the energy difference between the tGg and tGt conformers (notation explained in ref. 27). A large deviation between the ab initio and OPLS–AA calculations is found for the relative energies of these two conformers, as shown in Figure 1. In contrast to the OPLS–AA force field, the OPLS–AA–SEI force field correctly reproduces the ab initio results for these two structures (Table 1). The relative energy between a trans and a gauche conformation of a C–C–O–H dihedral angle, presented by the structures tGg and gGg, does not involve creating or breaking a hydrogen bond. The OPLS–AA–SEI closely reproduces the ab initio energy for these two structures and the energy difference of 0.5 kcal/mol (0.30 kcal/mol for the OPLS–AA) between them. Structures tGt and tTt allow us to compare the reproduction of the G,T relative energies of the ab initio and DFT calculations (0.6 kcal/mol and 0.9 kcal/mol, respectively) by the two force fields. OPLS–AA–SEI performs well with a relative energy of 1.25 kcal/mol in comparison to OPLS–AA, which gives a relative energy for the tGt conformation of almost 8 kcal/mol. The energy profiles for the rotation around the C–C–O–H torsion calculated at the ab initio, OPLS–AA and OPLS–AA–SEI level are presented in Figure 4 for the G and T conformers. The OPLS–AA–SEI force field calculated the g and g minima shifted by 30° with respect to the ab initio calculated values for the T conformer. Besides this deviation, the agreement between the quantum mechanics results and the OPLS–AA–SEI results is very good. The largest deviations are obtained for the OPLS–AA force field, which yields a too large barrier for the two profiles. In particular, for the rotational profile in which the O–C–C–O dihedral is arranged gauche, the OPLS–AA force field deviates from the ab initio calculated relative energy by more than 4 kcal/mol. This indicates that the additional scaling factor dramatically improve the gas phase conformational energetics for 1,2-ethanediol and that applying this scaling factor will also improve the conformational energetics for carbohydrates.
Hexopyranoses
Torsional Parameter Optimization
The torsional parameters assigned to hexopyranose structures are given in Table 3. The “identical types” are kept fixed during torsional parameter optimization. As in the standard OPLS version for carbohydrates, these parameters are taken from OPLS–AA

values for alkanes, alcohols and ethers17 where scaling the 1,5electrostatic interactions does not require a parameter refinement. The “new type” are those optimized for the OPLS–AA–SEI force field. For the OH–C–C–OH and C–C–O–H torsion the same analytical form as for 1,2-ethanediol is taken for the hexopyranoses. However, it turns out that the 1,2-ethanediol Fourier coefficient values can be further improved for hexopyranose and they are
therefore reoptimized. The three sets of Fourier coefficients are optimized for the O–C–O–(H, C) torsional types. In contrast to the OH–C–C–OH type, we find during torsional optimization that a single V1 term is sufficient for the OS–C–C–OH torsion. The OPLS–AA–SEI force field has three C–C–C–O parameters sets: C–C–C–OH for dihedral angle to the hydroxyl oxygen, C–C–C–OS for the dihedral angle to the ether oxygen, and C–C–C–OS_ace that

relates to the dihedral angle between the C3 ring carbon and the acetal group positioned on the C1 ring carbon. As for the unique C–C–C–O type of OPLS–AA, a single V1 term is sufficient for the C–C–C–OH. In contrast, three terms are more suitable for the C–C–C–OS torsion type. To correctly reproduce the methyl-hexopyranoside relative energies, it is necessary to add the new C–C–C–OS_ace type. “Ace” means acetal and indicates the position of this dihedral in the molecule.
Comparison of Relative Energies Obtained with the Two OPLS–AA Force Fields and at Ab Initio Level of Theory
In the following the performance of the OPLS–AA and OPLSAA–SEI force fields in reproducing ab initio calculated relative energies of five different hexopyranoses is compared. The 44 hexopyranoses structures included in the OPLS–AA parameter development are evaluated.9 Their relative energies are given in Table 4. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between the OPLS–AA–SEI (OPLS–AA) and the ab initio calculated relative energy is 0.61 (0.75) kcal/mol for all the 44 conformers. The RMSD for the 33 hexopyranoses with a hydroxyl at C1 (1, 2, 3; Fig. 5) is 0.65 (0.83) kcal/mol and 0.57 (0.42) kcal/mol for the 11 hexopyranosides with a methoxy group at C1 (4, 5; Fig. 5). The similar RMSD obtained for the OPLS–AA–SEI and the OPLS–AA force field indicates that the new scheme with the reduced electrostatic interactions fits the torsional parameter with the same quality only. This can be understood because the set of carbohydrate conformations consists of low energy conformations only. As the comparison of the conformational energetics for glycol shows, especially the high energy conformations are better reproduced with the new force field so that the RMSD obtained for the 44 low-energy carbohydrate conformations is not reflecting an improvement. The largest discrepancy (3.8 kcal/mol) between the ab initio and the OPLS–AA force field calculated energies is obtained for conformation 2f (Fig. 1). As expected, the OPLS–AA–SEI force field considerably improves the reproduction the ab initio relative energy of 2f. This shows that the additional scaling factor between 1–5 interacting atoms restores the balance between the 1– 4 and 1–5 electrostatic interactions. Consequently, the OPLS–AA–SEI is able to reproduce the energetics of all the hexopyranoses showing this structural change describing the exo-anomeric effect. The corresponding -anomers are represented by the structures 2g and 2h (Fig. 6). Both force fields yield a too high relative energy for these two structures with respect to the ab initio level calculations. However, the OPLS–AA–SEI (OPLS–AA) force field gives a larger deviation for both structures 2g and 2h being 1.5 (0.61) kcal/mol and 1.2 (0.95) kcal/mol.

An estimate of the energy difference between the conformers with which the anomeric effect is described can be deduced from the energy difference between structure 1c and its corresponding anomer 1j. The ab initio (1.17 kcal/mol) and OPLS–AA (1.22 kcal/mol) calculated energy differences are in a good agreement, whereas the OPLS–AA–SEI calculated energy difference is too high (1.94 kcal/mol). Finally, the relative energy of methyl-manno-pyranoside 5c is obtained too low by the OPLS–AA–SEI force field by about 1.4 kcal/mol. This large discrepancy leads to a slightly larger value for the RMSD of the 11 methyl-hexopyranoses in comparison to the one derived with the OPLS–AA force field. These results show that despite the fact that the OPLS–AA–SEI force field considerably improves the largest discrepancies of the OPLS–AA force field, it does not reproduce the relative energy of some carbohydrate characteristic structural features as accurate as the OPLS–AA force field. However, these few discrepancies could turn out to be less important for the overall quality of the molecular model. This is illustrated in the following by comparing rotational profiles calculated with both force fields and at ab initio level.
Comparison of Rotational Profiles Obtained with the OPLS–AA and OPLS–AA–SEI Force Fields and at the Ab Initio Level of Theory
Rotational profiles for the hydroxyl group at C1: the profiles for the rotation around the C1–O1 bond are shown for the - and
-anomers of D-glucopyranose and D-mannopyranose (Fig. 7). They describe the energetics of the exoanomeric effect in hexopyranoses and show how the epimerization at C2, going from Dglucose to D-mannose, changes the energetics of the O–C–O–H profile. Overall, the OPLS–AA–SEI improves the description of this effect in comparison to the OPLS–AA force field. However, there are still discrepancies, which are important to consider in future work. Parallel work done includes optimization of torsional parameters using only the glucopyranose conformers for the fitting. The results show that in this case the parameters are able to reproduce the relative energy of rotamers and lowest energy conformers with much better accuracy with respect to the ab initio. Therefore, considering other hexopyranoses, as the two anomers of D-mannose in this case, into the fitting significantly increases the complexity of system and therefore leads to a lower quality of the O–C–O–H rotational profile calculated for D-glucose. Rotational profiles for the hydroxymethylene group: the potential energy profiles for rotation around the C5–C6 bond are examined for the -D-glucopyranose and the -D-galactopyranose (Fig. 8). The effect of the epimerization at C4, corresponding to the structural difference of -D-glucopyranose and -D-galactopyranose, on the energetics of the different orientations of the hydroxymethylene group is investigated.36 The hydrogen of the hydroxyl at C6 is held fixed at 180° with respect to the C5 atom so that the possible intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydroxymethylene group and the adjacent hydroxyl group and the

ring oxygen atom are avoided. The shape of these two profiles cannot be explained in terms of classical effects (i.e., electrostatic and steric) alone. Stereoelectronic interactions favor the gauche orientation of the O5–C5–C6 –O6 unit. The additional scaling factor used in the OPLS–AA–SEI force field significantly improves the reproduction of the ab initioderived energies of certain conformations in the investigated rotational profiles. However, there are still large errors where the both force fields show the same discrepancies. If the improvement in reproducing ab initio data also leads to better properties derived in the liquid phase is tested in the following.
Liquid Simulation
The performance of the OPLS–AA–SEI and the OPLS–AA force field parameters sets in the liquid phase is evaluated in MD simulations of -D-glucose and -D-galactose in explicit water. Rotation around the exocyclic C5–C6 bond of two hexopyranoses is expected to lead to three conformations, namely, g, g and t, which exist in an equilibrium (Fig. 9). The relative population of these conformations has been evaluated using 1H-NMR spectroscopy with which different ratios are obtained for D-glucose and D-galactose.37–39 Both intramolecular interactions and interactions
with the solvent determine the most populated structures. Therefore, reproducing the experimentally derived data will provide a test for the newly developed force field. For hexopyranose the relative population is directly determined from 10-ns MD simulations. The runs differ by the initial position of the hydroxymethylene group. The g and t starting conformations are arbitrarily chosen for the -D-glucose (Fig. 10), and the g and t for the -D-galactose (Fig. 11). Starting from different conformations allows assessing whether the simulation time is long enough to obtain adequate sampling and converged values of the evaluated properties. The rotation around the C5–C6 torsion for each run is shown as function time in Figures 10 and 11 and the relative population ratios are summarized together with the 3JHH coupling constants in Table 5. Not unexpectedly, the population ratios and the 3JHH couplings lead to the same interpretations of the simulations. The experimental results show that -D-glucose conformers are distrib

uted as g:g:t  56:44:0. The ratio obtained from the OPLSAA–SEI for the -D-glucose is in qualitative accordance with the experimental results. The g and g species predominate, and there is a negligible amount of the t conformation (69:27:4). The simulations carried out with a g and t starting orientation of the
exo-cyclic hydroxymethylene group provide the same conformational ratio (Table 5). The two simulations a and b using the OPLS–AA force field do not show the same ratio for the -Dglucose. Starting from the g conformer, the hydroxymethylene group prefers the g orientation, while the g and t conformers appear with equally low probability. Starting with the t conformer, the hydroxymethylene group is distributed as g:g:t  45:51:4. After 10ns the conformational behavior of the hydroxymethylene group is still different in simulations a and b. Therefore, longer simulations would be required for obtaining a converged relative population for the OPLS–AA force field. This indicates that the conformational space is less efficiently sampled using the OPLS–AA force field. From the measured J-couplings it is known that the -Dgalactose conformers are distributed as g:g:t  17:63:20. The OPLS–AA–SEI results present two distributions for simulations a and b (Fig. 11). Starting from the g conformer (simulation a), the hydroxymethylene group is distributed as g:g:t  9:53:38. Simulation a predicts the correct order of the conformer populations with a maximum of 15% deviating from the experimental values. Starting with the t conformer (simulation b), the hydroxymethylene group is distributed as g:g:t  4:35:61. This distribution of populations is different from simulation a but converges towards the behavior of a towards the end (8 –10 ns, 16:50:34). This indicates that there are still sampling problems for the OPLSAA–SEI force field or that the 10ns simulation time is not long enough for obtaining a converged population ratio. The OPLS–AA calculations present similar statistical results for simulation a and b (Fig. 11). The predominance of the g conformer over the t conformer is well established by this force

field. The g conformer has a too low population, which is consistent with the OPLS–AA force field overestimating the gasphase energy curves in the region of 240 –360 for the galactose (Fig. 8). Further, differences between the conformations populated
in the liquid phase by the OPLS–AA–SEI and the OPLS–AA force field are found in the time evolution of the C1–C2–O2–H2 dihedral angle. The sampling problems mentioned above can be recognized. The OPLS–AA force field obtains about one transition

per nano second between different conformations, whereas the OPLS–AA–SEI obtains many. Considering the fact that the lifetime of a hydrogen bond formed by a hexopyranose and a water molecule is in average between 5 and 50 ps,40 one would expect rather more than just one rotation to occur. Visual inspection of Figure 12 shows further that the g conformation is populated the most by the OPLS–AA–SEI force field whereas the OPLS–AA force field populates more g conformations. The gas phase rotational profile for the C1–C2–O2–H2 torsion is shown in Figure 13. The OPLS–AA force field obtains an energy
for the g conformation, which is about 4 kcal/mol higher than the ab initio calculations. This large discrepancy can be understood, because the geometries compared in this rotational profile differ in fragments of 1,2-ethandiol, for which already such a large discrepancy between the ab initio and the OPLS–AA was found (Fig. 1). The improvement obtained by the OPLS–AA–SEI force field to describe the gas phase energetics of 1,2-ethanediol is therefore directly reflected in this rotational profile. The relative energy for the g conformation calculated by the OPLS–AA–SEI force field is closer to the one calculated at the ab initio level of theory. The large difference in the gas phase energy of the g conformations obtained for the two force fields leads to the different populations of the conformations observed in the liquid phase. Unfortunately, there are no experimental data with which the most populated conformation originating from different orientations of the C1C2–O2–H2 angle could be identified. Due to the mean field approximation used for deriving the nonbonded interactions of the OPLS–AA force field, the strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond formed in 1,2-ethanediol is exaggerated, and consequently, the conformations without such a hydrogen bond are found too high in energy (Fig. 1). These conformations without an intramolecular hydrogen bond form in solution more hydrogen bonds with the solvent than the conformation with an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Because, in comparison to their gas phase interaction energy, the hydrogen bonds formed with the solvent are also exaggerated,3 the gas phase relative energy of the conformations without an intramolecular hydrogen bond should, therefore, be higher than the ones derived at ab initio level of theory. In this way, a proper balance between the intra- and the intermolecular interactions is obtained in simulations using explicit solvent. It is, however, unclear how much higher in energy the conformations without an intramolecular

hydrogen bond have to be relative to the lowest energy conformations in the gas phase. This is a general problem of the parameterization concept of pair-wise additive force fields, which makes it impossible to derive the torsional parameters systematically. Opposite to this concept, the OPLS–AA–SEI parameter set does reproduce the ab initio-derived gas phase relative energy of 1,2-ethandiol conformations without an intramolecular hydrogen bond. In this way, lower barriers for rotation are obtained for hexopyranoses and, therefore, far more transitions between different orientations of the C1–C2–O2–H2 angle are observed than in the simulations conducted with the OPLS–AA force field (Fig. 12). The OPLS–AA–SEI force field therefore describes the conformational behavior of a hexopyranose in aqueous solution in a more realistic way than the OPLS–AA force field. Because the new scaling factors are applied within a hexopyranose only, and because Vishnyakov et al.21 found that OPLS–AA describes the conformational space of a disaccharide in aqueous solution very well, the OPLS–AA–SEI can be used to study polysaccharides in solution. The application of an additional 1,5-scaling factor makes it necessary to also add a 1,6-scaling factor to be able to fit the torsional parameters. Trials to fit the torsional parameters without an additional 1,6-scaling factor and excluding the hexopyranose conformations with an exocyclic hydroxymethylene group acting as hydrogen bond donor or acceptor have not been successful. As outline above, such a fitting procedure would be more compatible with the mean-field approximation applied in pair-wise additive force fields than applying the additional 1,6-scaling factor.
Conclusion
The OPLS–AA force field for carbohydrates is modified by applying additional scaling factors for the electrostatic interactions of the 1,5- and some special 1,6-interactions and by adjusting the torsional parameters. This new scheme for the electrostatic intramolecular interaction has considerably improved the force field reproducing the ab initio calculated relative energies of 1,2ethanediol and the three hexopyranoses, glucose, mannose, and galactose. For the new force field a similar RMSD between the ab initio calculated and the force field calculated relative energies is obtained for the 44 carbrohydrate conformers used for the parameterization. However, it considerably reduces the largest deviation between the ab initio results and OPLS–AA force field, which are observed when complete rotational profiles are compared. The barriers in such profiles represent conformations with broken intramolecular hydrogen bonds and are populated in aqueous solution forming hydrogen bonds with the solvent. This indicates that the balance between strength of intra- and intermolecular interactions is shifted increasing the strength of intermolecular interaction energies. In the OPLS–AA force field, scaling of the 1,4-electrostatic interactions by a factor of 2, causes an imbalance which is the source of the largest deviation from the ab initio results. Adding 1,5-scaling factors successfully restores this balance in hexopyranoses and, by scaling the excessive electrostatic contribution to the total intramolecular energy, improves the conformational energetics for 1,2-ethanediol dramatically. However, the addition of
a scaling factor for 1,5-interactions makes it necessary to add a 1,6-scaling factor for particular interactions. Only with this 1,6scaling factor it is possible to restore the required balance of the electrostatic interactions to optimize the torsional parameters for certain hexopyranose conformations. This limits the approach taken in this work to improve a pair-wise additive force field to the molecular building block closed in itself, such as the one of hexopyranoses. However, those molecular building blocks can be combined with each other, which leads in this case to polysaccharides. If the 1,5- and the 1,6-interactions between building blocks had to be scaled is currently being investigated by comparing the computationally determined conformational with experimentally derived ratios. The solvation effect on the conformational equilibria is investigated by long time scale MD simulations on -D-glucose and -D-galactose. This tests if the gas phase energetics is reasonable and if the strength of the intramolecular interactions is in balance with the strength of the intermolecular interactions. The population ratio of the conformations originating by rotation around the C5–C6 is directly determined for -D-glucose and -D-galactose from MD simulations. The simulations performed with the OPLSAA–SEI accurately reproduce the glucose experimental results, whereas the simulations performed with the OPLS–AA force field suffer from sampling problems. Nevertheless, results obtained for -D-galactose indicate that there are still problems for the OPLSAA–SEI force field or that the simulation time is not long enough to obtain converged population ratios. In comparison to the OPLS–AA force field, the new scheme obtains barriers for rotation of hydroxyl groups, which are generally closer to the ones determined at ab initio level, which leads to a higher hydroxyl transition frequency and better solvation in aqueous solution. The structural features of carbohydrates, and of 1,2-ethanediol clearly demonstrate the limits of what can be handled with pairwise additive force fields. The problems encountered indicate that a general improvement of the current molecular model can only be achieved by replacing the mean-field approximation used to describe the polarized liquid state by an explicit treatment as done in polarizable force fields.41 For the parameter development of polarizable force fields it will be a good benchmark to test how well carbohydrates can be treated. Although proteins and peptides are of larger general interest, they do not challenge the force field as much as the structural features of carbohydrates do.
