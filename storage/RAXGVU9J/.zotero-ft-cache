Definition
Microphase separation is a phenomenon generated by block copolymers composed of incompatible chemical components, where they tend to spontaneously form phase-separated structures with microscopic length scales due to intramolecular phase separation in bulk or in concentrated solutions. The spatial scales are governed by their chain lengths, while their morphologies can be varied by their relative compositions. The phenomenon happened there is called microphase separation, and the resulting structures are named microphase separation structures or microphase-separated structures. The prefix “micro” used here simply means “small,” and their actual periodicity ranges from, roughly speaking, a few nanometers to several hundred nanometers, depending directly on their chain size, i.e., molecular weight of component polymers.
History
Historically, it was recognized that two-component block copolymers with incompatible components, polystyrene and polyisoprene, show interesting viscoelastic behavior associated with two-phase state [1]; during that period there was no real space images by any kinds of microscopes. After transmission electron microscopic techniques were introduced to polymer material field [2], the existence of periodic structures was clearly admitted, and it brought small innovation into polymer material researches. Among them, a pioneering work by Matsuo et al. first exhibited the idea of morphological transition depending on the compositions of component polymers [3]. During the same era, a theoretical treatment appeared [4], followed by quantitative arguments given by Helfand et al. [5]. More smart theory by taking into account interaction strength was reported by Leibler [6], where traditional spherical, cylindrical, and lamellar structures were treated. Accompanied by the discovery of continuous structures in the 1980s and 1990s [7], theoretical phase diagram was revised by Matsen and Schick [8]. The history treated here is limited to the simplest two-component linear diblock copolymers, though many interesting achievements have been done for any other copolymers with complex architectures.

Morphological Transition with Compositional Change: Qualitative Description
The substances that naturally give microphase separation structures can be attractive high-performance materials; particularly the ones with both smaller size in the range around 10 nm and the larger size beyond 100 nm are precious soft materials. The former size is useful in fine resist patterning, while the latter is convenient in visible light-controlling devices. In addition, both spatial sizes are difficult to realize in the other materials, and therefore, block copolymers are peculiarly useful in the nanotechnology field. Figure 1 schematically shows the simplest morphology formed by an AB diblock copolymer, in which lengths of A- and B-blocks are almost the same. From this figure, one notices that actually two molecules occupy one periodic distance in a head–head and tail–tail manner. If A/B ratios of copolymer molecules deviate from unity considerably, their self-assembly patterns, which are directly associated with the shape of A/B interface, can be varied systematically depending on the ratios [3]. In short, when A/B ratio is so small around 0.1, component A forms spherical domains, and they form bcc lattice in the matrix of component B as shown in Fig. 2a. If A/B ratio increases up to 0.2, the minor A domains become hexagonally packed cylinders in B matrix (Fig. 2b). Further increase of A/B

ratio produces a double-gyroid structure (Fig. 2c) [9], which includes interwoven double networks of A in B, and the system transfers to lamellar structures (Fig. 2d), if A/B approaches unity. When A/B ratio goes up more, gyroid, cylindrical, and spherical morphologies appear again though the roles of A and B are switched. This morphological transition can be caused to minimize free energy of structure formation at certain composition by scarifying the interfacial energy increase, to earn conformational entropy of longer chains.
Quantitative Argument: Chain Conformations and Interfacial Structures
The more quantitative description of this phenomenon can be given, and a theoretical treatment which is presenting a whole sketch is introduced here. Figure 3 shows the phase diagram of diblock copolymers, where the horizontal axis is the fraction f of one component, while the vertical one is the interaction strength, wN [8]. Here w is the Flory–Huggins-type A–B interaction parameter which is the function of temperature T as w = a + b/T, where a and b are constants and N denotes the degree of polymerization. And hence, w changes with increased T, if b is positive; for example, the system becomes disordered when the temperature goes high enough, it being associated with the bottom region in Fig. 3. It should be notified that the morphological transition can happen if a horizontal line is drawn at, say, wN of 30, which is quantitatively the same as that displayed in Fig. 2. The upper part of this figure can be assigned as strong segregation regime, while the lower part can be categorized as weak segregation regime. Somewhat more quantitative discussion can be made in the strong segregation regime, particularly for lamellar structure because this morphology is the simplest and easy to handle. The repeating distance of microdomains, D, is well known to be scaled as molecular weight, M, of the whole block copolymer molecules as D ~ M2/3; this relationship has been investigated both experimentally [10] and theoretically [11]. It should be stressed on the fact that the exponent in this relation, 2/3, is larger than 1/2, which is the important scaling factor on chain size, Rg, of homopolymer molecules in bulk, that is, the relation Rg ~ M1/2, since D should be proportional to Rg here. This means that block copolymer chains are evidently elongated toward the direction normal to domain interface. Furthermore, conformations of block copolymer chains in lamellar microphase-separated structure have been measured by small-angle neutron scattering. There are several reports on different systems; on the whole, block chains are elongated toward the direction perpendicular to the lamellar domain interface,

while they shrunk to a parallel direction to compensate the elongation [12]. As a final result, the volume occupied by a chain in the confined space is the same as that of homopolymer in free space as schematically represented in Fig. 4. This means that the degree of interaction of the individual chain is the same in both cases. Interfacial features of microphase separation structure have been investigated by neutron reflectivity measurements for thin films with lamellar structures whose lamellae are aligned parallel to substrates. Widths of microdomain interfaces [13], defined as full width at half maximum of interfacial distribution of segments, were found to be 3–5 nm, depending on the value of interaction strength, i.e., the magnitude of the w parameter between polymer species.
Systems with Wide Molecular Weight and Composition Distribution
So far the argument was limited to the “monodisperse” system, where molecular weight and composition distribution of the samples are both narrow. To the contrary, somewhat perturbed system such as the one composed of wide molecular weight or composition distribution and also block copolymer/homopolymer blend system have been studied. Domain periodicity of the sample with composition distribution was found to be quite regular, whereas domain spacing of polydisperse system is quantitatively larger than that of monodisperse one. As for block copolymer/homopolymer blend, the latter can be dissolved in the microphase of block copolymers if the molecular weight of homopolymer is much smaller than that of block chain with the same chemical repeating unit. Miscibility limit is not so high when the molecular weight of homopolymer is comparable to that of block chain. Microphase-separated structures of more complicated molecular architectures than AB diblock copolymers have been widely investigated. They are ABA triblock, (AB)nA multiblock, (AB)n star-block, etc., if the scope is limited within a two-component system. Very roughly speaking, the structure of ABA triblock copolymers is almost the same as those of diblock copolymers with the half sizes of those triblock copolymers. Along the same line, those of the multiblock copolymers of the (AB)nA are almost the same as those of AB diblock of 1/2n-th size, especially in the case of lamellar structures.

The morphology of star-block copolymers is known to be similar to that of one arm, that is, the domain size of (AB)n star-block is equivalent to that of simple AB diblock copolymer. In addition biconuous network structures can be more easily formed from these star-shaped copolymers than linear diblock [14].
Structures from Three-Component Terpolymers
Microphase separation structures of ABC linear triblock terpolymers have been well investigated. The inherent structural feature of these molecules is that they show three phases separated with two different interfaces on which A/B and B/C junction points stays, and hence center B chains have to adopt bridge conformations. This condition gives direct effects on structure formation. Their morphologies can change variously depending on the relative composition, and many complicated new structures have been found. Among them, a series of symmetrical samples, whose volume fractions of two end chains are the same, are particularly deeply studied. Basically four kinds of superlattice structures, whose A and C domains are exchangeable, have been found; they are three-phase four-layer lamellar structure, tricontinuous doublenetwork structure, cylindrical structure with tetragonal arrangement, and CsCl type of spherical structures [15]. Furthermore microphase separation structures of ABC star polymers have been extensively studied. The important structural features of the self-assembled state of these molecules consist in the fact that their junction points have to be aligned on one-dimensional lines, either straight or curved, since there is no way to put them on two-dimensional planes in case three components have to phase separate. Many characteristic structures including hierarchical structures and cylindrical structures have been observed for the sample of the IXSYPZ type (I, polyisoprene; S, polystyrene; P, poly2-vinylpyridine). Among them, cylindrical structures give particular interests, because their cross sections give various periodic tiling patterns. Several Archimedean tiling patterns whose meeting manners of regular polygons are exactly the same throughout the structures [16] have been found from a series of samples whose relative composition was varied systematically. Moreover, a quasicrystalline structure with dodecagonal symmetry has been discovered as an extension of the formation of regular Archimedean tiling with a small change in composition as clearly evidenced in Fig. 5 [17].
