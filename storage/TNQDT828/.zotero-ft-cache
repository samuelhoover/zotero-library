ABSTRACT
Charged (macro)molecules are essential components in natural materials and organisms; thus the rational design of biomimetic materials requires a holistic understanding of structure–property relationships in charged systems. We discuss recent progress in uncovering such relationships for polyzwitterions and polyelectrolyte complexes, with emphases on the synthetic strategies that were employed in systematic studies. For polyelectrolytes, discussion is confined to the effects that structural variations in polycation and polyanion structure have on the fundamental phase behavior of the corresponding polyelectrolyte complexes. In the field of polyzwitterions, both fundamental and applied properties are discussed in relation to chemical structure. Finally, we present an overview of promising chemistries that will expand the structural landscape of charged macromolecules with the aim of stimulating new research to further uncover and understand the fundamental design principles for these materials.
1. Introduction
Nature exploits all available covalent and non-covalent interactions for unparalleled spatiotemporal control over hierarchical length scales of macromolecular and supramolecular structure. Within this broad spectrum of interactions, electrostatics play a vital role and are especially relevant in aqueous environments. Strong intra- and intermolecular charge correlations pose a difficult problem in theory, and a unified model that can predict the properties and interactions of charged molecules across a broad parameter space is still lacking. Thus, the complex interplay of electrostatic and other non-covalent interactions of charged (bio)macromolecules still poses many open questions that will require broad collaboration among the life and physical sciences, as well as efforts from the engineering disciplines to drive toward new solid-state structures and responsive soft materials. Charged polymers are divided into two major categories: polyelectrolytes [1], or polymers bearing either cationic or anionic monomers, and polyampholytes, or polymers that feature both positively and negatively charged monomers along the chain. The latter includes the special case of polyzwitterions, which consist of neutral monomers
containing two oppositely charged moieties. Importantly, the ability for certain functional groups to gain or lose a charge based on their surroundings—most commonly from changes to the solution pH—means that it is also possible for charged polymers to become neutral or toggle between different classes (e.g., from polyampholyte or polyzwitterion to uniformly charged polyelectrolyte). Charged moieties typically enhance the water solubility of otherwise predominantly hydrophobic polymers and render them useful in many applications that feature aqueous environments, including ion sequestration, lubricious surfaces, and drug delivery. However, the extreme difference in molecular structure on the two ends of the charged polymer spectrum—polyzwitterions and polyelectrolytes—leads them to exhibit markedly different bulk and solution properties, which in turn motivates their use for widely different applications. For instance, polyzwitterions have a net neutral charge and exhibit inter- and intramolecular ionic associations, but can resist interactions with other species in solution; consequently, polyzwitterions are of interest in the protection of surfaces from adhesion of (bio)foulants, such as biomedical devices, synthetic cell membranes, and membranes for water treatment. On the other hand, polyelectrolytes contain like charges that tend to

associate with oppositely charged small counterions or macroions in solution. The binding of polyelectrolytes to particles or (bio)macromolecules can hence be leveraged in wastewater management (via flocculation), antibacterial materials, and gene delivery. For successful application of polyzwitterions and polyelectrolytes, it is crucial to unravel the structure–property relationships that guide the rational design of charged polymer systems. Judicious use of synthetic chemistry allows for ‘tailor-made’ charged polymers that can be employed to elucidate such relationships. Furthermore, proper selection of chemical transformations—be they small-molecule reactions, polymerization approaches, and/or post-polymerization modifications—can impart scalability to synthetic routes and enable additional functionality to be installed in charged polymers. The design space in the field of polyzwitterions has been historically limited; fortunately, this trend is starting to wane as the past decade has seen a renewed interest in new structures as well as significant progress in the use and versatility of controlled polymerization methods. It is vital that these efforts in novel polyzwitterion design continue, as the scientific community is just scratching the surface regarding the underlying mechanisms that impart the desirable properties of polyzwitterions. In the context of polyelectrolytes and their complexes, synthetic chemistry is a key facet of testing the universality of recently described phenomena observed for biomacromolecules. Furthermore, custom macromolecules are necessary to systematically decouple relevant variables to probe scaling laws and predictions provided by new theories and simulations regarding polyelectrolyte phase behavior. Such synthetic polymer design can be informed by advances in structural biology and the phase behavior of sequence-defined polypeptide complexes. On the whole, studies with designer polyelectrolytes and polyzwitterions will guide the conception of future biomimetic polymers that hold much promise in the development of functional, biocompatible, and sustainable materials for a broad range of applications. This opinion piece will focus on advances in the areas of polyelectrolyte complex phase behavior and polyzwitterions; in particular, we highlight recent systematic studies that leverage synthetic polymer chemistry to drive our understanding of these materials. Finally,
interesting open questions that the authors believe could be addressed by thoughtful chemical design will be presented to inspire other synthetic chemists to contribute to these vibrant and fascinating fields.
2. Polyelectrolyte complexes
2.1. Brief overview of polyelectrolyte complexation
Polyelectrolyte complexation refers to the electrostatic association of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PEs) in solution with concurrent release of small molecule counterions (Fig. 1). Although electrostatic attraction was originally believed to drive PE complexation, it has since been shown that the entropic gain from release of counterions and waters hydrating extrinsic ion pairs is what dominates the energetics of this process [2,3]. Enthalpic contributions to the free energy of complexation become more significant for low charge density (i.e., weakly charged) PEs and have been primarily attributed to the restructuring of water molecules around ion pairs [4]. PEs with weakly acidic or basic groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, primary–tertiary ammoniums) are charged within a pH range that is dictated by the pKa values of the corresponding moieties. Such pH-dependent polymers are therefore often referred to as weak polyelectrolytes, whereas those with relatively pH-independent charged groups (e.g., sulfonates, guanidiniums) are referred to as strong polyelectrolytes. On the macroscopic level, polyelectrolyte complexation results in polymer-rich and polymer-lean macrophases by either solid–liquid or liquid–liquid phase separation (SLPS or LLPS, respectively). Solid polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) are referred to as precipitates and are kinetically trapped structures thought to arise from strong ion pairs that exclude water to a greater extent than liquid complexes do [5]. However, a holistic understanding of what determines the phase of a given PEC is still an active topic of research. Liquid complexes—called polyelectrolyte complex coacervates—are equilibrium structures (at least in vitro) that manifest as liquid droplets upon mixing oppositely charged polyelectrolyte solutions; these droplets coalesce with time to form a dense, yet highly hydrated viscous phase often simply referred to as the coacervate (Fig. 1).

Polyelectrolyte complexation is sensitive to changes in local salt concentration or ionic strength as screening of charges on the polymer chains with increasing salt concentration results in the substitution of intrinsic for extrinsic ion pairs (Fig. 2). Adjusting pH to alter the charge density of weak PEs is another common method to traverse phase boundaries. This responsive nature of PECs makes them of great interest in biomedical applications as well as in the design of salt-processable or saloplastic materials [6]. Since the initial description of polyelectrolyte complexation by Bungenberg de Jong [7], biologists have identified many PECs that are vital to the survival of organisms. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of polyelectrolyte complexation and the structure–property relationships of PECs is essential to the development of new biomimetic and sustainable materials that have the potential to address pertinent issues in human health and environmental stewardship.
2.2. Polyelectrolyte complexes in nature
PECs are abundant in nature as they impart responsiveness, function, and tunable mechanical properties within organisms. Biomolecular condensates found in cells—called membraneless organelles (MOs)—are prominent examples and include the P-bodies, stress granules, Cajal bodies, and nucleoli [8]. MOs are subcellular, liquid or gel-like complexes of dozens to hundreds of biomacromolecules such as ribonucleic acids (RNAs) and proteins that can rapidly assemble and disassemble in response to their environment. Frequently, the constituent proteins are hetero-charged PEs (i.e., polyampholytes) where both positively and negatively charged amino acids are represented [9]. The weak interactions that lead to reversible phase separation are multivalent in nature and draw from a number of non-covalent interactions including ion-pairing, π–π and cation–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic associations [10]. MOs serve to compartmentalize, spatially segregate, and concentrate biochemical reactions important to cell function [11]. For example, LLPS in plants gives rise to the pyrenoid which is the site of photosynthesis [12]. In humans, malfunctioning in the LLPS of stress granules has been linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease [13]. Beyond their important role in cell function, complex coacervates have also been identified as constituents of natural functional materials such as underwater adhesives used by mussels [14,15] and projectile slimes used by velvet worms to capture prey [16]. Another particularly interesting example is the modulus gradient observed in the Humboldt squid beak, a composite of chitin and protein coacervates [17]. The protein coacervates regulate both the degree of cross-linking and hydration across the beak, resulting in a remarkable 200-fold stiffness and hardness gradient from base to tip. Protein sequencing has revealed that complex coacervates found in nature contain a large number of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and/or proteins with intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs). Hereafter, we will refer to IDPs and proteins with IDRs collectively as PIDRs. Contrary to the commonly presented picture of proteins exhibiting higher order structures (i.e., secondary and tertiary structures), it has been shown that disorder is in fact quite common and correlates with the complexity of the organism [18]. The observation that organisms of higher complexity contain a larger number of PIDRs suggests that their relatively flat free energy landscape enables these proteins to adopt many different conformations and even higher order structures in response to their environment or binding partners, rendering them functional in diverse contexts. Analysis of PIDR amino acid sequence points to patterns of motifs; for example, stretches of positively charged amino acids and/or hydrophobic (especially aromatic) residues, as drivers for LLPS. However, beyond blocky patterning it appears that conservation of the absolute sequence is not necessary to preserve the ability to undergo LLPS. In fact, Pak et al. studied the Nephrin intracellular domain protein and showed that shuffling of individual amino acid residues without changing the overall composition did not suppress (and in some cases, even enhanced) LLPS [19]. The independence of LLPS on absolute protein sequence is further supported by the fact that there is little to no sequence conservation between PIDRs performing similar functions and the built-in redundancy in biomolecular condensates via the large number of PIDRs and RNAs found therein [20].
2.3. Relevant parameters in polyelectrolyte complex phase behavior
2.3.1. Polyelectrolyte chain length and concentration
Structural biology has contributed much to our understanding of protein primary sequence and the dominant non-covalent interactions between amino acids that predispose mixtures of PIDRs and RNAs towards associative phase separation under physiological conditions. Similarly, polymer scientists have made significant advances in mapping out the phase behavior of 4- and 5-component coacervates (polyanion, polycation, counterions, water, and exogenous salt) prepared from aqueous solutions of synthetic PEs in vitro. A generic binodal phase diagram for macroscopic phase separation of associating polyelectrolytes is depicted in Fig. 3 to guide the reader through the forthcoming
Fig. 2. Schematic of intrinsic and extrinsic ion pairing of polyelectrolytes in aqueous salt solution.

Samples prepared with initial polymer volume fraction φp,i and salt volume fraction φs,i will phase separate from point C into supernatant C1 and complex C2 phases with low and high φp, respectively. With increasing φs, the 2-phase envelope narrows and φp in the coacervate phase decreases whereas it slightly increases in the supernatant. Coacervate density predominantly decreases due to swelling with water upon addition of salt. Point C3 indicates the salt resistance of the coacervate, which is the maximum amount of salt that will not disrupt the complex prepared at φp,i and φs,i. The critical salt stability of the coacervate is denoted as Cc; this point is independent of the initial φp. The tie line between points C1 and C2 can have a negative or positive slope (or none, as shown) depending upon the specific chemical interactions of the system under study.

discussion. Li et al. clearly delineated the phase behavior of poly(L-lysine hydrochloride)/poly(sodium D, L-glutamate) complex coacervates as a function of PE concentration and chain length at varying exogenous NaCl concentrations [21]. These studies employed stereoregular poly(Llysine hydrochloride) [PLK] and racemic poly(sodium D, L-glutamate) [PRE] because combinations of stereoregular polypeptides are known to produce solid precipitates rather than liquid PECs [22]. The authors rigorously accounted for salt, water, and PE concentrations in the coacervate and supernatant phases by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This analysis facilitated the following conclusions: 1) complexes were denser than predicted by the Voorn-Overbeek theory [23], 2) increasing initial PE concentration beyond some threshold led to suppression of LLPS (“self-suppression”), and 3) salt partitioned preferentially into the supernatant phase as ionic strength was increased. Furthermore, increasing the PE chain lengths resulted in complexes of increased salt resistance with a broader two-phase region, the latter of which was observed to reach a constant width after exceeding a critical PE chain length.
2.3.2. Polyelectrolyte hydrophobicity and charge density
To examine the influence of PE backbone chemistry on complex phase behavior, our research group recently prepared complexes from the four possible combinations of poly(sodium acrylate) [PAA], poly (allylamine hydrochloride) [PAH], PLK, and PRE (Fig. 4). This allowed for a direct comparison between polyethylene and polypeptide backbones while conserving specific ion interactions. Using optical microscopy, we observed that increasing backbone hydrophobicity afforded complexes with higher critical salt stabilities than their hydrophilic counterparts; this finding was consistent with a previous study where PE hydrophobicity was systematically altered by increasing alkyl content [24]. The complex with the highest aliphatic backbone content (i.e., PAH/PAA) formed precipitates at low exogenous sodium chloride concentrations ([NaCl]) that could be transitioned to liquid complexes at higher ionic strengths. However, resistance to full dissolution even at [NaCl] ~ 6 M was observed. As previously reported (cf. Section 2.3.1), PLK/PRE formed uniform spherical liquid complexes that were fully dissolved at [NaCl] > 1.0 M [21]. Interestingly, under salt-free conditions PAH/PRE formed non-uniform liquid complexes, whereas PLK/ PAA formed flaky precipitates; both of these complexes could be transitioned to liquid complexes resembling those of PLK/PRE but with
higher critical salt stabilities. Binodal phase diagrams obtained by TGA of all complex and supernatant phases furthermore illustrated the transitional nature of complexes with increasing aliphatic backbone content (Fig. 4) [25]. At low [NaCl], PAH-containing complexes exhibited the highest polymer density in the complex phases (φp ~ 0.4) whereas PLK-containing complexes were more dilute with φp ~ 0.3. For samples prepared at higher initial salt concentrations, PRE-containing complexes swelled rapidly with water and diminished in φp, whereas PAA-containing complexes exhibited almost constant φp until a critical [NaCl] was reached where coacervate density decreased. In the case of PAH/PAA, salt resistance of the complex exceeded the solubility of NaCl in water. From the binodal phase diagrams, first insights could be gleaned into how non-electrostatic interactions (in this case predominantly hydrophobic) affect coacervate properties such as critical salt stabilities and polymer volume fraction in the complex phase. PE hydrophobicity and charge density effects on complex phase behavior were further investigated in recent reports using thoughtfully designed polyelectrolytes. One work employed solid state peptide synthesis (SSPS) to produce 30-mers with perfectly alternating sequences of neutral residues (X) and charged residues; the former were either glycine (G), alanine (A), or leucine (L), and the latter were either lysine (D-lysine = k, L-lysine = K) or glutamic acid (D-glutamic acid = e, Lglutamic acid = E) [26]. For (kX)15/(eX)15 complexes, turbidity was observed to increase with neutral comonomer hydrophobicity (G < A < L). Interestingly, β-sheet formation was observed with diminishing size of the neutral comonomer, prompting the authors to prepare a second set of PEs with stereoisomers of both charged and neutral amino acids (Disomer = x, L-isomer = X): (kKxKkX)5 and (eExEeX)5. The alternation of charged amino acid stereoisomers effectively suppressed the hydrogen bonding responsible for secondary structure formation, although we note that the charge fraction (f) was higher for these PEs (f = 0.75) than for (kX)15 and (eX)15 (f = 0.50). The (kX)15/(eX)15 complexes were found to display higher stabilities with elevated temperature—an effect that became more pronounced with increasing comonomer hydrophobicity—suggesting that temperature can be used as an effective additional stimulus to salt or pH in weakly charged, hydrophobic polyelectrolyte complexes. Overall, the authors were able to conclude that hydrophobic interactions became more relevant to polyelectrolyte complex stability with increasing neutral comonomer hydrophobicity and decreasing charge density. The Laaser group elegantly used a single synthetic platform to

prepare PEs of variable charge density and hydrophobicity. Relative hydrophobicity and charge density were controlled by substoichiometric amidolysis of poly(N-acryloxy succinimide) [poly (NAS)] repeat units with ammonia or butylamine and subsequent reaction of the remaining NAS units with either N,N-dimethylethylenediamine or glycine methyl ester hydrochloride [27]. This approach afforded perfectly charge- and length-matched copolycations and copolyanions with f = 0.67 – 1. The effect of neutral comonomer hydrophobicity was assessed by comparing the series containing hydrophilic acrylamide—derived from reaction of poly(NAS) with ammonia—with the series containing hydrophobic butyl acrylamide—derived from reaction of poly(NAS) with butylamine (Fig. 5). Microscopy and TGA experiments indicated that phase behavior was dominated by f—complexes of lower charge densities displayed lower critical salt stabilities—whereas hydrophobicity had no appreciable effect on the phase behavior. This presents an interesting comparison to the works by Sadman et al. [24] and Tabandeh and Leon [26], where increasing the alkyl chain length of the charged group or comonomer hydrophobicity enhanced the salt stabilities of the complexes. We note, however, that the work by Sadman et al. employed aromatic polyanions and polycations—complexes which most likely engage in π–π and cation–π interactions. It is not clear how alkyl chain length impacts these more complex interactions as compared to classical ion pairs (vide infra). Furthermore, Tabandeh and Leon observed that hydrophobic interactions became significant only in complexes of low charge fractions (f = 0.5), thus it is possible that hydrophobicity in copolyelectrolytes prepared by Laaser and coworkers becomes significant at lower f-values than those that were studied. Lastly, it is difficult to compare across these different reports as degree of polymerization also varied significantly between the systems employed. Lou et al. elegantly demonstrated how local polarity—i.e. hydrophobicity near ion pairs—affects PEC phase behavior using homologous polycations and polyanions derived from neutral poly(allyl acrylamide) precursors via thiol-ene click chemistry and subsequent partial oxidation of polycation thioethers to modulate polarity (Fig. 6) [28]. Using
model compounds, the authors clearly showed that the amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidant could be used to control the relative amount of thioether to its singly and doubly oxidized analogues (sulfoxide and sulfone, respectively). When applied to the polycation, increasing the degree of oxidation correlated to a decrease in critical salt stability and a narrowing of the 2-phase window of the corresponding complexes. The change in the phase behavior was most pronounced when using 0.5 equivalents of H2O2 to thioether moieties, which correlated to approximately equal quantities of thioethers and sulfoxides in the side chains. Adding excess H2O2 (up to 2 eq.) did not alter phase behavior significantly, which suggested that solvent quality did not vary much between sulfoxide and sulfone species.
2.3.3. Cation–π and π–π interactions
Cation–π and π–π interactions are common in LLPS—both in natural and synthetic systems—with one of the most widely-studied examples being the underwater adhesive employed by mussels. Aromatic rings exhibit quadrupole moments that can interact with each other as well as with monopoles of cationic species. This interaction is electronic rather than hydrophobic in nature; however, hydrophobic contributions have been shown to further stabilize this interaction as smaller solvation shells allow for closer proximity between poles and thus strengthen their interaction [14]. Sadman et al. evaluated the morphologies and rheology of poly(styrene sulfonate) [PSS] complexed with random copolycations containing both primary amine and guanidinium side chains [29]. Increasing the content of the more hydrophobic guanidinium component to beyond 10% resulted in exclusive formation of solid precipitates that could not be transformed into coacervates even with the addition of large amounts of exogenous guanidinium bromide (up to 4 M). This result is in good agreement with an increasing cation–π interaction strength due to an increase in cation hydrophobicity.
2.3.4. Polyelectrolyte hydrogen bonding
PAH/PAA complexes were recently studied at pH 3, 6.5, and 9 to elucidate the effect of solvent quality and hydrogen bonding on the complex phase behavior [30]. For each pH condition, charge fraction (i. e., degree of ionization of carboxylic acid and amine groups) was determined analytically and used to inform the preparation of complexes at charge stoichiometry. The binodal phase diagram of PAH/PAA complexes at neutral pH was consistent with the one disclosed in the previous report (vide supra) [25]. Interestingly, the binodal phase diagram obtained for PAH/PAA complexes prepared under basic conditions—with ca. 24% ionized amines in PAH—closely resembled that at neutral pH. The most significant difference in phase behavior was observed for complexes prepared under acidic conditions. At pH = 3, weakly ionized PAA (~3%) precipitated in aqueous NaCl solutions. Hence, PAH/PAA complexes assembled at acidic pH afforded pre
cipitates containing a disproportionate amount of PAA (67% by 1H NMR spectroscopy). To separate the effects of hydrogen bonding from hydrophobic interactions at pH = 3, PAH/PAA complexes were prepared in the presence of urea—a strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. High concentrations of urea (up to 16 M) promoted transition from solid to liquid PAH/PAA complexes that were resistant to dissolution with NaCl. This suggested that hydrogen bonding caused precipitation of PAH/PAA, while the high salt resistance was attributed to complex stabilization via hydrophobic interactions. TGA of complex and supernatant phases enabled comparisons between complex densities (i.e., φp) as a function of [polymer], [salt], and pH. In neutral and basic conditions, complex density was observed to be nearly constant up to salt concentrations of 3.5 M NaCl. This was in stark contrast to the phase behavior of complexes in acidic pH; here φp was observed to first rise then slowly decrease with increasing [salt]. PAH/ PAA complexes prepared at higher [polymer] and pH = 3 afforded more divergence in the binodal phase behavior from that of complexes formed at pH = 6 or 9; this was attributed to stronger hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding effects at increased polymer concentration.

2.3.5. Polyelectrolyte sequence
In line with the observed effect of monomer sequence on PIDR coacervation [19], recent reports from Perry and Sing have demonstrated by a tandem approach (transfer matrix theory and experiments with polypeptides) that complexation and complex salt stability is sensitive to polyelectrolyte [31] and polyampholyte [32] monomer sequence. In the PE case, a fully charged polyanion (polyglutamate) was mixed with sequence-defined copolycations [poly(lysine-co-glycine)] with constant charge fraction (f = 0.5) but variable mixing of charged and neutral amino acids. The authors observed that the resultant complexes exhibited higher critical salt stability and broader width of the 2phase window as the block length of the charged monomers increased (i. e., less mixing of neutral and charged monomers). A similar trend was found for lysine/glutamate polyampholytes with varied blockiness of the charged domains. In polyampholytes, one must furthermore consider the effect of oppositely charged block interfaces on complex phase behavior (Fig. 7). It was shown that increasing the number of charge-pattern interfaces correlated with a weakening of the electrostatic driving force for coacervation. The results from both studies are in line with predictions made via a random phase approximation: blocky charged sequences are expected to have a stabilizing effect on complex coacervates of statistical copolyelectrolytes [33].
2.3.6. Understanding and manipulating polyelectrolyte complex phase
Controlling polyelectrolyte complex phase—solid or liquid—and switching in between these phases constitutes an area of great interest. A number of works have suggested that solid complexes are prone to form for PE pairs of high charge density with strongly interacting intrinsic ion
pairs that are embedded in a hydrophobic environment depleted in water molecules, and for PE pairs with periodic hydrogen bonding between chains [22,25,26,34]. Recent studies have aimed to enhance our understanding of how salt, hydration, and organic cosolvents drive transitions in solid polyelectrolyte complexes. Monovalent salts have long been known to have a plasticizing effect on solid polyelectrolyte complexes due to screening of charges on the polyelectrolyte chains and substitution of extrinsic for intrinsic ion pairs. The innate ability of a salt to plasticize a PEC has been correlated with the Hofmeister series, which ranks salt ions in their ability to salt-in or salt-out proteins [35]. Recently, the Schlenoff group has shown that the Donnan equilibrium accurately predicts the partitioning of small molecule salt ions into the complex and supernatant phases; furthermore, the authors provided a general experimental procedure to accurately probe salt partitioning in any polyelectrolyte complex [36]. Most importantly, the authors emphasized that specific local chemical interactions of intrinsic ion pairs rather than global factors determine salt partitioning. Using isothermal calorimetry, Schlenoff and coworkers were further able to discern two distinct enthalpic regimes upon continued doping with salt: the exogenous salt ions first pair with the PE charges, but past some threshold the exogenous ions also become co-ions [37]. Hydration has emerged as the foremost determinant for polyelectrolyte complex phase. Systematic accounting for the ratio of intrinsic ion pairs to water molecules in three chemically distinct PE pairs demonstrated that the glass transition temperature (Tg) in PECs is a function of the number of water molecules surrounding intrinsic ion pairs. On a molecular level, water was resolved to have three roles: 1) contributions to free volume, 2) weakening intrinsic ion pairs between PE chains, and 3) ‘lubricating’ PE chains that are sliding past each other [38]. Saikaew et al. assembled PECs in aqueous NaCl solutions of different ionic strength, dried them, and then swelled them in water to quantitatively remove small molecule salt; interestingly, they found that the Tg values for the PECs correlated to the [NaCl] used during assembly [39]. The authors rationalized that increased conformational freedom during assembly led to formation of tighter networks and/or more entanglements of PE chains. Similarly, Meng et al. observed an increase in modulus of PECs composed of two strong styrenic polyelectrolytes—PSSNa and poly[(vinylbenzyl) trimethylammonium chloride] [PVBTMACl] (Fig. 8)—when treated with up to 2 M aqueous sodium bromide (NaBr) [40]. TGA analysis revealed that polymer content increased meanwhile water content decreased from 90% to 75% in the complex phase between 0 and 2 M exogenous NaBr. Thereafter, the complex transitioned to a liquid coacervate and followed expected swelling along with a decrease in polymer content in the complex phase with increasing exogenous NaBr. This phenomenon is akin to what is observed for neutral polymers: thermal history influences the

morphology and thereby the properties of the polymer. Presumably, solid PECs formed in water afford kinetically trapped structures that can rearrange to an equilibrium structure upon treatment with salt. Hence, salt again takes on a role analogous to that of temperature in neutral polymer solids. Perhaps hereafter in working with solid PECs one should erase the “salt history” of the complex prior to further analysis. The understanding that hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions can promote solid PEC formation has prompted recent investigations into processing of solid complexes in mixed solvents. For example, complexes of PSSNa and PVBTMACl could be plasticized yet not fully dissolved even at high aqueous [NaBr]. However, Meng et al. found that assembly of PSSNa/PVBTMACl in ethanol/water or ethylene glycol/water with NaBr led to transition from solid to liquid complexes at lower [NaBr] and allowed for full complex dissolution with increasing salt concentration [41]. The authors observed that transitions from solid to liquid to full dissolution occurred at lower [NaBr] in ethanol/water than in ethylene glycol/water mixtures. This was attributed to the more hydrophobic quality of ethanol. Similarly, Boas et al. found that assembly of PAA/PAH in ethanol/water at pH 2 produced transparent, homogeneous solutions as compared to white precipitate when assembled in acidic water [42]. Small angle X-ray scattering and rheology pointed towards the formation of PAA/PAH networks in ethanol/water whereas assembly in water resulted in the formation of large solid aggregates, in line with what was reported by Li et al. [30].
2.3.7. Upper and lower critical solution temperatures in PECs
Phase transitions in polyelectrolyte complexes are predominantly driven by regulating the intrinsic/extrinsic ion pair ratio using exogenous salt or pH changes. A recent report by Prabhu and coworkers demonstrated that complexes of poly(diallyldimethylammonium bromide) [PDADMABr] and PSSK (Fig. 8) exhibited a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) that could be adjusted by the initial polymer concentration (Cp) and/or exogenous potassium bromide concentration ([KBr]) [43]. UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy results revealed that the concentration of PSS in the polymer-rich phase increased with temperature, suggesting that heat decreased solvation of PSS chains. Ye et al. expanded upon this work and showed that the initial polymer concentration (Cp) dictates the phase transitions of PDADMA/PSS complexes in aqueous KBr; low Cp (0.15 M) resulted in an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) whereas high Cp (0.3 M) resulted in a LCST [44]. We note here that both studies worked with stoichiometric complexes of PDADMABr of Mw ~ 150 kg/mol but Ye et al. employed PSS of Mw ~ 500 kg/mol as compared to the PSS of Mw ~ 200 kg/mol used by Prabhu and coworkers. Interestingly, in both studies the LCST brought about liquid–liquid phase separation, but the UCST observed by Ye et al. at low Cp promoted solid–liquid phase separation. Raman spectroscopy was used to identify contact ion pairs (CIPs) and solvent-separated ion pairs (SIPs) [44]. At low Cp, the authors observed more CIPs with a lower degree of hydration whereas doubling the Cp formed complexes with
more SIPs. Hence the authors suggested distinct cation–anion interactions at various Cp as the molecular mechanism for the differential phase behavior.
2.4. Conclusions and outlook
By virtue of new theoretical models and systematic experiments with naturally occurring and synthetic polyelectrolytes, our understanding of PEC phase behavior has undoubtedly greatly advanced, even when only considering literature from the past three years. A comprehensive picture emerges when one takes into consideration all non-covalent interactions between components and balances attractive and repulsive interactions appropriately. Experiments that isolate individual parameters are extremely useful in this endeavor and can help improve theoretical models. Of course, it is virtually impossible to only impact a single variable when making even the smallest of changes in these complex systems; however, judicious choices in the design of synthetic systems is certain to enhance our fundamental understanding of these biologically relevant processes. With the intense interest in polyelectrolyte complexation over recent years and, taking into account that this area has traditionally not attracted many synthetic chemists, with few exceptions [27–28,45,46], some of the remaining questions could benefit from contributions employing the entire palette of available chemistries. For example, an interesting open question is the role of monodispersity and precise monomer sequence in polyelectrolyte complex phase behavior. Results from structural biology suggest that precise sequence, which is imperative to enzyme structure and function, may not be crucial to engineering polyelectrolyte complexes with hierarchical length scales of structure. Furthermore, the built-in redundancy by virtue of dozens to hundreds of biomacromolecules—presumably a polydisperse population—that participate in LLPS implies that nature’s approach hinges more on chemical composition and the tuning of interaction strengths by patterning of motifs. Hence, it would be useful to experimentally verify how much polydispersity and precise monomer sequence affects coacervate phase behavior. Furthermore, the vast and expanding array of synthetic monomers allows design and investigation of PEs with backbones other than polyethylenes and polyamides. This is particularly pertinent considering that complex coacervates are of interest in biomedical applications; in such cases, building PEs that are biocompatible and/or degradable under physiological conditions to non-toxic products is desirable. On the other hand, the development of ‘stealth’ materials for drug delivery motivates the use of polymer backbones that are biocompatible yet are not readily cleaved by enzymes—as is the case for polypeptides. Patterning of motifs is also available to the synthetic chemist working with monomers functionalized with orthogonally reactive groups. Strategic selection of monomers and polymerization methods that provide appropriate relative rates of polymerization enables a variety of monomer distributions. Neutral precursors to charged polymers are a valuable platform towards the design of homologous polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes with different motif patterning. In Section 4 we will discuss specific strategies that may be used to address the aforementioned challenges in a systematic fashion using synthetic chemistries that have so far not met their full potential in this field.
3. Polyzwitterions
3.1. Introduction to zwitterionic materials
Zwitterions are small molecules that contain spatially-separated positive and negative charges. Many zwitterions are found in nature—two prominent examples are phospholipids in cell membranes and certain osmolytes in plants or animals—but these compounds are not polymeric [47,48]. However, bio-inspired synthetic polymers with zwitterionic groups (i.e., polyzwitterions) have emerged as a rich area of

study with prominent focuses in artificial membranes, drug delivery, and engineering materials for water treatment or biomedicine [48]. Most of these materials typically employ one of three moieties—phosphoryl choline (PC), sulfobetaine (SB), or carboxybetaine (CB)—each of which bears a quaternary ammonium group but features a different anionic group (Fig. 9A) [49].
Polyzwitterions (PZs) are generally hydrophilic and have strong intra- and inter-molecular ion-pairs [50]. Consequently, PZs have zero effective net charge so long as the pH of the medium is not low enough to protonate the anionic group; similarly, if the nitrogen is not quaternary, there will be an upper limit of pH beyond which the zwitterionic character will also be lost. In zwitterionic form, the ionic associations present in PZs often manifest fickle solubility. The use of harsh solvents (e.g., hexafluoroisopropanol, trifluouroethanol), aqueous salt solutions, or applied heat is often required to solvate PZs. Of the three major categories of zwitterions shown in Fig. 9A, SB-containing polymers tend to have the lowest aqueous solubility and commonly exhibit a UCST in pure water. Despite these practical difficulties, zwitterionic materials exhibit some very desirable properties including biocompatibility as well as the ability to resist adhesion of proteins, bacteria, and other organisms (i.e., anti-biofouling, Fig. 9B) [51]. However, we note that it is often prematurely asserted that a PZ will be ideal for antifouling or biomedical applications. In the realm of antifouling, it is important to test the resistance of a given PZ (or a series of PZs) to multiple foulants, as the results can differ significantly for specific foulants and media. In the highlights below, we therefore point out when antifouling is tested on a variety of foulants as well as when actual cell viability or other relevant biocompatibility experiments are carried out. Our aim is to amplify the importance of expanding the characterization of zwitterionic materials to include as many relevant representative experiments as possible. Generally, the evolving landscape of zwitterionic materials is composed of monolayers, bi- or multi-layers, layer-by-layer films, polymer brushes, and polymer networks [48]. Of these, we focus primarily on new advances in zwitterionic brushes and surface-tethered PZ networks (Fig. 9C). Brushes can be obtained by physically adhering polymers to a surface (i.e., physisorption) [52,53], but chemical attachment is considered a more robust strategy; the latter can be achieved by tethering polymers to a surface (‘graft-to’ method) or growing polymers directly from surfaces (‘graft-from’). The graft-from method typically provides a higher density of polymers per unit of surface area and is therefore preferred from the standpoint of zwitterionic material applications. There are, however, distinct advantages to the graft-to and physisorption methods including the ability to rigorously characterize polymers prior to their attachment to surfaces. Surface attached networks can be obtained by cross-linking polymer brushes or simultaneously cross-linking and surface-tethering polymers that are coated onto a surface. Below we highlight some recent advances in the field of polyzwitterion research, with a focus on studies that report novel materials, apply PZs in new ways, or systematically elucidate structure–property relationships. In particular, the systematic studies demonstrate the value that proficiency in synthetic chemistry can bring to the field of polyzwitterions; the majority of zwitterionic materials are derived from a few commercially available or readily prepared molecules [48,49]. The major consequence of this lack of structural diversity is an incomplete understanding of which features result in (and ideally augment) the desirable properties that PZs exhibit. Therefore, we also provide some commentary regarding exciting opportunities for the synthetic chemist, primarily regarding iterative adjustments to the structure of PZs while minimizing the introduction of additional variables. The hope is that these highlights will provide valuable insight into the current state of zwitterionic material design and stimulate emerging directions for PZderived materials.
3.2. Recent progress in zwitterionic materials
3.2.1. Novel PZ materials
The development of new bio-inspired and/or bio-based PZs is a continuous endeavor. Here, we highlight two recent works that may motivate future fundamental and applied studies. The first is a bio-based example that makes use of L-carnitine, a non-toxic amino acid derivative

that can be obtained on a large scale [54]. This molecule has a secondary hydroxyl between carboxylate and trimethylammonium groups; when reacted with acryloyl chloride, the zwitterionic CB-type monomer (CA) with a unique Y-shaped geometry was obtained (Scheme 1A). The corresponding PZ brush was shown to reduce protein adhesion (lysozyme and fibrinogen) to below the detection threshold of surface plasmon
resonance (<0.3 ng cm 2). Resistance to bacterial adhesion (E. coli) was also demonstrated and shown to be on par with that of an unspecified poly(CB methacrylate), presumably a more common variant with a linear geometry. In line with some of the systematic studies on zwitterion geometry demonstrated in Section 3.2.3, future work could investigate in detail the fundamental solution and applied surface properties of CA-based materials with those derived from linear CB analogues. Furthermore, the inherent chirality of carnitine suggests potential for systematic comparisons of PZs derived from racemic and enantiopure CA. In 2019, there was an exciting disclosure of an unprecedented PZ inspired by an osmolyte found in saltwater fish: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) [55]. To synthesize the TMAO-inspired monomer, the authors oxidized a commercially available acrylamide (Scheme 1B; mild oxidants were unsuccessful in obtaining full conversion without any side reactions, but the use of 50% aqueous hydrogen peroxide and oxygen was successful in producing the monomer). From a synthetic standpoint, this one-step reaction to yield a zwitterion without any added salts is desirable and likely industrially scalable. The authors reported three types of materials derived from this TMAO-inspired acrylate monomer: 1) bulk PZ hydrogels (i.e., networks), 2) PZ brushes, and 3) protein–PZ conjugates. The first two materials were used to demonstrate the antibiofouling properties in vitro using concentrated fibrinogen solution and undiluted human blood serum, respectively. The hydrogel was also used in vitro to show resistance to cell adhesion and low complement protein activation (inadvertent complement protein activation would promote protein adsorption in vivo). The protein–PZ conjugates were used in vivo in mice to demonstrate the low immunogenicity and improved circulation efficiency relative to analogous poly(ethylene glycol) conjugates. This easily-synthesized TMAO-inspired polymer opens the door to a new class of PZs that, given the promising series of in
vitro and in vivo tests, is of great interest to investigate further.
3.2.2. Robust attachment of PZs to surfaces
The traditional grafting-to and grafting-from approaches are indispensable for both fundamental and applied studies because of the high degree of control over the resultant polymer brush. Achieving a welldefined PZ brush, however, requires careful planning of the three major aspects: the desired substrate, the monomer chosen, and the polymerization method to be used. It is therefore important to consider other, more versatile means of obtaining surface-attached PZ materials. Two emerging, robust strategies that are amenable to PZ systems include the bio-inspired polymerization of dopamine (or its derivatives) and photochemical C–H insertion. Both are straightforward and can be applied to a wide range of polymers and surfaces. There are many structural motifs that are useful for photochemical surface attachment, and we refer the reader to a recent review [56] and some selected examples [57–61]. Photochemical C–H insertion is also heavily featured in the studies discussed in Section 3.2.3, so here we provide a brief overview and some recent applications of the poly(dopamine) approach, which is inspired by the underwater adhesion of marine organisms. The main principle is that dopamine possesses two functional groups—catechol and a primary amine—that are present in the proteins primarily responsible for mussel adhesion [62,63]. There are several ways to promote dopamine polymerization, but mild solution oxidation is the most common. The result of this process is an adhered network of polydopamine (PDA) with some reactive functional groups remaining (e.g., phenols, amines), but the exact polymerization mechanism and structure for PDA are still under debate. The persisting mysteries of PDA formation make it difficult to predict exactly the result that one will observe, and thus one must rely on empirical trends that have been determined. Nonetheless, the versatility of PDA adhesion has provoked its use in many scientific fields, and zwitterionic materials research is no exception. Zwitterionic PDA networks can be obtained by oxidative polymerization of a zwitterionic dopamine derivative (e.g., recently reported SBcontaining variant) [64,65] or by reacting zwitterionic molecules with pre-formed PDA coatings (e.g., by Michael addition or Schiff-base formation) [66–68]. In the context of polyzwitterions, there are three main approaches: 1) co-deposition, 2) grafting-to, and 3) grafting-from. Codeposition can be further subdivided into two categories: copolymerization of dopamine with zwitterionic monomers [69–70] or polymerization of dopamine in the presence of a preformed PZ [71,72]. Graftingto can be achieved using PZs with incorporated dopamine-like moieties [73,74] or other groups that react with PDA (e.g., cysteine) [75]. Grafting-from requires immobilization of a polymerization initiator on a PDA surface [76–79], then growing zwitterionic or pre-zwitterionic polymers from these initiator sites; of these two, the latter strategy is less desirable because conversion to the zwitterionic brush post polymerization may not proceed quantitatively [80]. Evidently, there are ample opportunities to apply PDA for PZ surface attachment, and so we have depicted a couple useful molecules for grafting-to or grafting-from approaches (Fig. 10). We also direct the reader to a recent review that provides a chemistry-based perspective on the state-of-the-art of PDA and related bio-inspired catechol(amine) coatings [81]. However, the ill-defined nature of PDA—irrespective of its success in adhering polymers to virtually any surface—makes it less ideal from a rational materials design standpoint; results obtained may be specific to a given PZ system and not generalizable to the broad range of PZ structures. Therefore, a useful future research direction may be a case study that employs the three approaches above for a particular PZ system and directly compares the surface properties and performance of the obtained zwitterionic coatings.
3.2.3. Systematic elucidation of polyzwitterion structure–property relationships
There are a plethora of parameters that can be varied in PZs: the

nature of the polymer backbone, the periodicity of zwitterionic units along the backbone, the spacer between the polymerizable unit and the zwitterionic moiety, the identity of the zwitterionic group, the length and chemistry of the spacer between the charged groups, the substitution of one of the charged groups (if possible, e.g., quaternary ammonium vs. primary ammonium), and the geometry of the zwitterion (Fig. 11). Considering the added possibilities that come with using comonomers—each of which with a similar set of parameters that can be varied—it is evident that the design space for polyzwitterions is enormous. We have therefore decided to focus on studies in which the trends that emerge are due to systematic variations of PZ structure rather than use of different comonomers with a particular zwitterionic monomer. Although we also omit discussion of fully zwitterionic copolymers, we do refer the reader to two exciting recent examples: 1) statistical copolymers containing varied amounts of CB and SB groups [82], and 2) to the best of our knowledge, the first fully zwitterionic triblock copolymer [83]. Certain empirical trends have been established that are robust across many zwitterionic systems; for example, substantial thickness of PZ brushes or surface-attached PZ networks is generally necessary to achieve optimal resistance to foulant adhesion. Yet, a deep understanding of the relationships between PZ structure and fundamental properties (e.g., solubility, ion-pairing, conformation, hydration) or applied properties (e.g., biocompatibility, resistance to biofouling) remains lacking. In
recent years, several works have shown progress in this regard—usually these reports provide some answers while also raising new open questions. A study by van Andel et al. investigated the effect of zwitterion chemistry and ± spacer length (n = number of methylene units) on the protein repellence of PZ-coated magnetic beads [84]. The sample set included a PC methacrylate (MPC, n = 2), a CB methacrylamide (CBMAA, n = 2), two SB methacrylamides (SBMAA and SPP, n = 2 and 3, respectively), and a hydroxyl-containing methacrylamide (HPMAA) [Fig. 12]. The latter is an especially valuable inclusion as there are few studies that quantitatively compare zwitterionic and non-zwitterionic antifouling materials. We note that the polymerizable unit and side chain spacer in MPC are slightly different than those of the other four monomers; however, given the synthetic difficulties associated with PCcontaining molecules, this series of monomers is close to ideal for a direct comparison of zwitterion chemistry effects on antifouling. The polymerization conditions for each monomer were first optimized using planar gold surfaces to ensure that the PZ brush thickness on the beads would be comparable for all systems. The beads were immersed in single-protein solutions (fluorescently-labeled bovine serum albumin, BSA) or complex media (10% biotinylated serum, later made fluorescent by incubation with labeled streptavidin). Antifouling performance for each system was evaluated by rapidly measuring the fluorescence of ~ 10,000 beads by flow cytometry. All coated beads had negligible amounts of adsorbed BSA, but the biofouling in complex media was more significant and thus differences in the protein resistance of the coatings could be resolved. In 10% serum, the order of antifouling performance for the pendant groups was: HPMAA ≥ MPC ≈ CBMAA > SBMAA > SPP. The observed ranking is in line with two trends found in the literature: 1) sulfobetaines are outperformed by carboxybetaines (provided the pH is not so low that the carboxylate is protonated), and 2) hydroxyl-containing polyacrylamides can perform similar to or better than PZs. The combination of quick and high-volume analysis makes this bead-based assay appealing for future systematic antifouling investigations of PZs, so long as the foulants can be fluorescently labeled. As a priori predictions of how well a particular non-zwitterionic polymer

will perform compared to PZs are not yet possible, such investigations could also feature a broader series of hydroxyl-containing monomers to hopefully shed light on which structural features result in competitive or superior protein repellence relative to zwitterionic analogues. SB solvation (and thus protein repellence) is highly dependent on ionic strength, and so the authors also polymerized the SB monomers from planar surfaces to study protein adhesion in various dilutions of cow serum (3.3, 10, and 33%) [84]. In all cases SBMAA was more protein repellant than SPP, although the difference was indeed more significant when the brushes were less solvated (i.e., at lower ionic strengths). This conclusion is also in line with prior reports: at physiologically-relevant ionic strength (>0.1 M), increasing ± spacer length negatively affects protein resistance. Another recent systematic study investigated the properties of commercial filtration membranes coated with selective layers made from statistical copolymers [85]. Each copolymer was made with the hydrophobic monomer 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFEMA) and one of four zwitterionic monomers: MPC, SB methacrylate (SPE), sulfobetaine 2-vinylpyridine (SPVP), or sulfobutylbetaine 2-vinylpyridine (SBVP) [Fig. 13]. Upon microphase separation, the TFEMA and zwitterionic segments respectively formed hydrophobic domains and hydrophilic nanochannels; all membranes had similarly sized channels (~1 nm) and molecular weight cut-offs (~1 kg/mol). Their markedly different hydrophilicity, water flux/uptake, and fouling resistance were therefore attributed to the differences in zwitterion chemistry and polymer backbone. All of these properties were measured to be lower for membranes derived from the zwitterionic 2-vinylpyridines than for those derived from methacrylic zwitterions; of the two latter membranes, the one with PC groups in the nanochannels outperformed the one with SB groups. From an applications standpoint, the a priori more hydrophobic vinylpyridinium backbone is evidently less desirable than the methacrylate backbone. By comparing the properties of SPVP- and
SBVP-derived membranes, it was found that increasing the ± spacer length by one methylene unit decreases the performance (as was observed in the previous study by van Andel et al.). Besides these important conclusions, it is worth emphasizing that 1) the use of statistical copolymers—not block copolymers—still resulted in bicontinuous morphologies desirable for filtration, and 2) the same zwitterionic content in the four copolymers (33–36 wt%) fortuitously resulted in similarly sized hydrophilic domains, enabling a direct comparison across the four systems studied. So far, the studies discussed in this section employ commerciallyavailable or readily synthesized zwitterionic monomers. However, there are several excellent reports from recent years that demonstrate the utility of synthetic chemistry in revealing PZ structure–property relationships while simultaneously generating new materials with remarkable (and often unpredictable) properties. One prominent example is the ‘inverse’ variant of PC known as choline phosphate (CP). CP derivatives were introduced in 1996 but have remained relevant in large part due to the complementary interactions with the PC residues on the surfaces of cell membranes [48,86]. In fact, Kobayashi and coworkers recently succeeded in quantifying adhesive interactions between CP and PC groups using polymer-coated surfaces and functionalized atomic force microscopy tips [87]. Both PC and CP groups have the same ± spacer—this is due to the fact that they are made from similar 5-membered cyclic precursors—but CP-containing monomers can be structurally varied by changing the R group attached to the terminal phosphate moiety (Fig. 14). Earlier CP derivatives contained more hydrophobic R groups (long alkyl chains) [86], but more recent work has pushed toward shorter, more hydrophilic, and/or functional R groups [87–89]. We did not list the methyl variant (R = CH3) because it is unstable [90] and its synthesis is nontrivial; [88] however, several very recent reports have shown that a similar “quasi-CP” methyl derivative is achievable [91,92]. In 2016, excellent synthetic work by Hu and Emrick demonstrated that valuable functionality (alkenes and alkynes) could be installed on CP derivatives and thus render the corresponding polymers amenable to a wide variety of post-polymerization modifications [89]. That same year, a fundamental solution property investigation revealed that polymers with

butyl CP groups aggregated in aqueous salt solutions while those with PC groups did not [93]. Future studies with shorter and/or more hydrophilic R groups would be useful in decoupling the influence of dipole orientation from the added hydrophobicity of the butyl groups. Another impressive series of studies spans from 2014 to present and involves SB-containing methacrylates and methacrylamides. Several of the zwitterionic monomers employed were unprecedented in the literature and required several synthetic steps; in so doing, the authors were able to systematically probe structural effects on both fundamental and applied properties. In the 2014 and 2016 reports, the UCST of three SB-containing poly (methacrylamides) were investigated in pure water, pure D2O, and various aqueous salt solutions [94,95]. All three monomers had the same side chain spacer (n = 3) and the typical geometry—a linear sulfobetaine with the ammonium closest to the polymer backbone—but the chemical nature of the ± spacer was varied (Fig. 15). The UCST was investigated by turbidimetry, which could accurately measure the phase transition temperature (i.e., cloud point or Tcp) of the polymer solutions; a higher cloud point corresponds to inherently lower polymer solubility. Several of the cloud point results were quite unexpected. Firstly, the inclusion of a hydroxyl group did not markedly improve the solubility; in fact, for a given polymer molar mass and solution concentration, the Tcp for poly(SHPP) was similar to or higher than the Tcp for poly(SPP). From a hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity standpoint, this result is counterintuitive and thus a valuable indication that there are other factors at work when it comes to SB solvation in aqueous solutions. On the other hand, the analogous comparison of Tcp for poly(SBP) and poly(SPP) revealed that having one more methylene group in the ± spacer does indeed decrease the solubility (i.e., increase the Tcp), which is in line with the expectation one would have from an added hydrophobicity perspective. There are several other unexpected results from these studies that may have important consequences for the field. The first is that all cloud points were significantly higher in pure D2O than in pure H2O (up to 15
◦C difference). Not only is this finding mysterious from a fundamental standpoint, but it also implies that conclusions drawn from any studies on poly(SBs) in D2O solutions may not be directly transferrable to normal aqueous environments that are better representative of the proposed applications (e.g., biomedicine and water treatment). In particular, neutron scattering in D2O is a tool commonly used to analyze the conformational changes of SB-containing materials; it may therefore be useful to also perform complementary x-ray techniques in aqueous solutions such as resonant soft x-ray scattering or reflectivity [96]. The second important result is that the salting-in behavior of these poly(SBs) was not necessarily straightforward—minima and maxima were sometimes observed depending on the concentration and type of salt added—which is contrary to the widespread assumption that salting-in
proceeds by a smooth decrease in the cloud point (i.e., increase in the miscibility). We note, however, that the maxima observed may be less relevant for physiological applications as the ionic strength would likely be high enough to achieve full solubility of the materials studied here (i. e., > 0.1 M). Lastly, salting-in efficiency typically follows the empirical Hofmeister series—as was indeed found for poly(SPP) and poly(SBP)yet the salting-in efficiency for poly(SHPP) was instead found to follow the reverse of the Hofmeister series. Yet again, this is an indication that poly(SB) solubility is complex and there remains a lack of fundamental understanding that would otherwise allow for such behavior to be predicted. A follow up study was published in 2017, this time focused on a larger series of SB-containing polymethacrylates with three variables systematically varied: ± spacer length (n = 3 or 4), side chain spacer length (n = 2 or 3), and the substitution of the positively charged nitrogen (Fig. 16) [97]. Consistent with the previous studies, increasing the ± spacer by one methylene unit—comparing poly(1)–poly(4) versus poly(5)–poly(8)—increased the observed cloud points (i.e., decreased solubility). Furthermore, the cloud points in pure D2O were always higher than those in pure H2O, sometimes even more significantly than
was observed in the polymethacrylamide systems (up to 25 ◦C difference). As in the previous studies, complex salting-in behavior was also observed. However, this was only the case for the morpholiniumcontaining poly(3) and poly(7), whereas the salting-in behavior of poly(1), poly(4), poly(5), poly(6), and poly(8) was straightforward. The reason poly(2) is not included in the previous comparisons is that poly (2) was completely soluble in both H2O and D2O at all concentrations
and molar masses studied (up to 50 g L–1 and ~155 kg/mol). However, the inexplicably high solubility of poly(2) was not the only unexpected result; several trends were observed that would not have been predicted from a straightforward hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity viewpoint. For example, the addition of larger substituents on the quaternary ammonium (i.e., dimethyl vs. heterocycles) actually decreased the cloud point. Furthermore, the substitution of a methylene unit for an oxygen atom in the heterocycle (i.e., piperidinio vs. morpholinio) increased the cloud point. These trends were consistent across the two series of polymers with different ± spacer lengths [i.e., poly(1)–poly(3) and poly(5)–poly(7)]. Another counterintuitive trend emerged when comparing cloud points for poly(1) and poly(5) to those of poly(4) and poly(8), respectively; the former have side chain spacers with 2 CH2 units whereas the latter have side chain spacers with 3 CH2 units. It was found that increasing the side chain spacer length by one (formally hydrophobic) methylene unit significantly decreased the cloud point. This meticulous study therefore demonstrates the value of designing new zwitterionic monomers such that structural variables are systematically varied, as small changes in structure lead to large and sometimes counterintuitive changes in the fundamental properties of the corresponding polymers. In three very recent works, similar variations in PZ structure were realized and their effects on an applied property (foulant resistance) were studied. One of these studies will not be discussed in detail here, but essentially the authors expanded on the sample set shown in Fig. 16 by further varying the polymer backbone (methacrylamides and sty
renes) and including analogous sulfabetaine (SO–4) variants[98]. In the other two studies, new SB monomers with unique Y-shaped geometries were studied (Fig. 17) [99,100]. The first study focused on the properties of polymethacrylates derived from SPE, SPC, and SPY [99]. Interestingly, both polymers with Y-shaped zwitterions [i.e., poly(SPC) and poly(SPY)] did not exhibit an upper critical solution temperature in pure water, whereas pseudoisomeric poly(SPE) was insoluble until > 50 ◦C. To make materials for in vitro anti-biofouling tests, copolymers with a small amount (~1 mol %) of benzophenone-containing monomer BPEMA were made; thin films of the copolymers were then prepared on various substrates and subsequently UV-irradiated to facilitate simultaneous cross-linking and covalent tethering to the surface. Besides the control network made with

butylmethacrylate (BMA), the cross-linked films all exhibited low contact angles (15–25◦) characteristic of hydrophilic surfaces. The SB geometry resulted in a small but statistically significant difference in the water contact angles, which increased as poly(SPE) < poly(SPC) < poly (SPY).
The thin films were then exposed to solutions of single proteins or marine organisms to test the effect of SB geometry on the antifouling capabilities. Importantly, the three proteins used had different net charges at physiological pH—lysozyme (positive), fibrinogen (neutral), and BSA (negative)—and the marine organisms were representative of passive or active settlers (diatoms and barnacle cyprids, respectively). As expected, the zwitterionic networks outperformed the poly(BMA) reference in both sets of experiments. For all PZ networks, protein repellency generally improved in the order lysozyme < BSA < fibrinogen. For a given protein, the fouling resistance improved in the order poly(SPY) < poly(SPC) ≤ poly(SPE). From the protein studies, it appeared that the Y-shaped geometry was diminishing the performance; however, the resistance to settlement of both to marine organisms was apparently independent of geometry. Therefore, this systematic study demonstrates that only in some cases may the linear geometry be preferred. In the second study, the authors omit SPY but include SPP, ZPP, and
another reference material derived from OEGMA [100]. As in the first study discussed in Section 3.2.3, the inclusion of a non-zwitterionic but antifouling reference material is a valuable addition. By including the methacrylamides SPP and ZPP—the latter is a sulfabetaine—the effects of polymer backbone, anion chemistry, and SB geometry could be directly compared. Photochemically cross-linked thin films were prepared and separately exposed to the same three proteins and two representative marine organisms: diatoms (passive settlers) and green algae zoospores (active settlers). As before, all zwitterions reduce protein adhesion relative to poly(BMA) and the effect is least pronounced for positively charged lysozyme. The Y-shaped SB geometry again performed poorly compared to the linear analogues, irrespective of the backbone chemistry of the latter (polymethacrylamide or polymethacrylate). Surprisingly, the linear sulfabetaine outperformed all poly(SBs) regarding protein resistance, which was contrary to the findings of a separate simulation study. For the marine organism studies, the Y-shaped variant poly(SPC) was omitted on account of its relatively poor protein repellency. Unlike the protein adhesion studies, the linear sulfabetaine did not outperform two linear SB variants when it came to resisting marine organism settlement. In fact, there were no stark differences in diatom resistance across the three linear PZs—poly(SPP) did slightly better than the other two but it

shares structural features with each; poly(SPE) is a SB as well and poly (ZPP) has a polyacrylamide backbone. For algae settlement resistance, the sulfabetaine was found to be worse than one of the SBs [poly(SPP)] but on par with the other [poly(SPE)]. Thus, these two studies demonstrate that systematic variations of PZ structure are crucial to understand how one can improve antifouling performance, while also demonstrating that screening various foulants is crucial to seeing the bigger picture—a PZ may perform excellently against one foulant but not another. As the authors put it, there seems to be “no universal champion” at present. As a final note on these PZs, we direct the reader to a useful study by these authors on the long-term hydrolytic stability of SBand sulfabetaine-containing polymethacrylates and polyacrylamides;
[101] such stability studies are important to inform the translation of new zwitterionic materials into real-world applications. The second series of systematic studies involving novel PZ design spans from 2017 until present and features a completely different polymer platform: ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of zwitterionic or pre-zwitterionic oxanorbornene-based monomers. PZs made via a ROMP approach were introduced in 2008 but subsequent reports have been sparse due to the ubiquity of radical polymerization [102,103]. In most reports the zwitterion geometry is linear, but in a few cases the hydrolysis of the imide in the repeat unit yields a PZ with a different geometry: a carboxylate group vicinal to a pendant unit with a quaternary ammonium unit [104–106]. These works used a comonomer

with pendant triethoxysilane groups to achieve covalent attachment to glass and interchain cross-linking. More recently, this class of materials has been revisited and expanded upon by the group of Lienkamp [107–109]. By employing benzophenone-functionalized surfaces (Fig. 18A), photochemical cross-linking and surface anchoring was used to both expand the substrate scope and simplify the polymer synthesis aspect (no comonomer is needed). A tetrathiol was also employed to further cross-link the PZ materials via UV-activated thiol–ene chemistry (Fig. 18B). The first report in 2017 was the original disclosure of PZI, which was made via ROMP of a pre-zwitterionic (N-Boc-protected) monomer and subsequent hydrolysis (Fig. 18C) [107]. The pre-zwitterionic polymer was conveniently soluble in organic solvents, and remarkably, PZI was also soluble in an organic solvent (methanol); this solubility has favorable implications for design of PZI-based materials. The substrate versatility of the photochemical cross-linking and surface attachment of PZI was demonstrated using glass, gold, silicon, and a commercial polyurethane wound dressing. The other two polymers studied here for comparison were a protein-repellant sulfobetaine analogue (PSB) and an antimicrobial cationic analogue (SMAMP, Fig. 18D). Remarkably, PZI demonstrated a combination of these properties: its resistance to fibrinogen adhesion was on par with that of PSB, and its antimicrobial efficacy against E. coli or S. aureus was comparable to or better than that of SMAMP. Human cell viability studies were also performed; these demonstrated that PSB and PZI were relatively non-toxic whereas the SMAMP polymer was mildly toxic. A follow-up study was thereafter published that also included the carboxybetaine analogue PCB (Fig. 18E); [108] in so doing, the authors sought to discern the importance of the primary ammonium group (PZI) versus the quaternary ammonium group (PCB) in achieving this impressive combination of anti-microbial, protein-repellent, and nontoxic properties. Relative to PZI, PCB was similarly resistant to fibrinogen adhesion. When testing cell viability, it was found that while PCB was not toxic, it was not as conducive to human keratinocyte cell growth as PZI. Interestingly, the antimicrobial activity of PCB against E. coli or S. aureus was moderate relative to PZI; this important finding implies that perhaps other previously-reported CB-containing materials might have inherent antimicrobial activity that has not yet been revealed, simply due to the lack of expectation for antimicrobial properties. This report also featured a more expansive study of the bioactivity of all four polymers—PCB, PZI, PSB, and SMAMP—including protein repellence in more complex media (serum and plasma) and in the presence of bivalent cations as well as bacterial adhesion studies. Earlier this year, it was shown that the key structural motif of PZI—the carboxylate and ammonium are on the same repeat unit but on different pendant groups—can be translated to other systems. More specifically, this was demonstrated with a vinyl monomer derived from itaconic acid (a potentially renewable compound) and the resultant polymer network was shown to have a similar property profile to PZI: protein-repellent but also cell-compatible and inherently antibacterial [110]. The working hypothesis for the antimicrobial activity of these zwitterionic polymers (including PZI and PCB) is that the carboxylate group is protonated by the excreted acidic metabolites of bacteria, rendering the surface temporarily cationic and thus antibacterial. The fact that antifouling materials may have inherent antimicrobial activity without relying on other added components (e.g., incorporation of cationic or biocidal features) or mechanisms (e.g., stimuliresponsiveness) is an exciting discovery that will surely inform future zwitterionic material design. There are also important physical considerations regarding the surface topology that may further boost the desirable properties of such materials [111]. For example, these ROMPderived PZs were used to make micro/nano-structured mono- and bifunctional surfaces by microcontact printing; the topography of the surface, in conjunction with the inherent bioactivity of the cationic and zwitterionic components, enabled such surfaces to resist fouling and kill bacteria [109]. Here too a systematic investigation was able to uncover a
structure–property relationship, as surfaces with too large of a feature spacing—antimicrobial SMAMP features were printed on top of a protein-repellant PSB base layer—were no longer able to repel proteins and kill bacteria. Further work on this system employed colloidal lithography to probe the effects of surface pattern and feature stiffness on the bioactivity [112,113]. This series of studies highlights the various physical parameters that should be interrogated in order to optimize a given zwitterionic material.
3.3. Conclusions and outlook
Although synthetic PZs have been continually investigated since their introduction in the 1950s, we are still in the early phases of understanding the fundamental reasons behind the remarkable and unexpected properties that PZs exhibit. To unravel these mysteries, new monomers must be designed and the fundamental solution properties of the corresponding polyzwitterions must be carefully studied. Expanding the current PZ landscape beyond the few monomers that dominate it—or more generally, beyond vinyl monomers—will be key to validate the universality of reported structure–property relationships. Testing the applied properties of new PZs will often require attachment to surfaces, and robust strategies like photochemical C–H insertion or polydopamine tethering are desirable because of their facile and versatile nature. Finally, engineering surfaces from a physical standpoint (e.g., topological variation) will be an important final step in further optimizing PZ properties, and perhaps also unlocking emergent functions from fortuitous combinations of the chemical and physical characteristics of a surface. In the spirit of stimulating such a holistic effort into systematic PZ material development, we outline some promising chemistries in the following section that are at present relatively underexplored for polyzwitterion synthesis.
4. Chemistries for the synthesis of new polyelectrolytes and polyzwitterions
4.1. Introduction
As discussed in the previous sections, thoughtful chemical design has enabled the systematic study of how isolated parameters affect properties of PECs and PZs. The vast majority of these advances were made using controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods, SSPS, and ROMP. SSPS is invaluable in its ability to produce sequence-defined polymers and is not synthetically demanding. However, SSPS is limited to the production of small quantities of material at a time with peptide or peptoid backbones, degrees of polymerization of 100–150 monomers, and uses large quantities of toxic organic solvents. CRP is a simple and scalable method accessible to most researchers and one can choose from a large variety of commercially available monomers, including charged monomers which can be polymerized directly. On the other hand, CRP often requires rigorous exclusion of oxygen, is limited to polymers with primarily hydrocarbon backbones, and not tolerant to the alkene functional group—arguably the most versatile for postpolymerization modification (PPM). ROMP is simple, generally fast, and tolerant to a variety of functional groups. ROMP therefore has great potential to be employed as a means to elucidate fundamental structure–property relationships of PECs and PZs, but the full monomer scope has not yet been taken advantage of in this regard. In this section we discuss complementary—albeit in part more synthetically involved—polymerization techniques that provide access to new polyelectrolytes and polyzwitterions that can address open questions in these fields.
4.2. Ring-opening polymerization: Access to heteroatom-containing backbones
Heterocycles are amenable to ring-opening polymerization (ROP)

with a wide variety of catalysts and conditions determined on a case-tocase basis. In general, ROP requires rigorous exclusion of water and other nucleophiles which may act as adventitious initiators, thereby compromising molar mass control and/or deactivating the catalyst. Highly polar and/or charged species are not tolerated and therefore charged polymers are typically accessed by PPM. The transformation of a single neutral polymer batch is, however, quite advantageous for direct, fundamental comparisons of homologous charged polymers. Furthermore, characterization of neutral polymers is far less challenging than the analogous process for charged polymers (especially for PZs). The main limitation of PPM is that, in some cases, achieving quantitative functionalization can be challenging. In addition, a subset of heterocycles with reactive groups for post-polymerization functionalization have to be synthesized from commercial precursors. Hence, synthetic expertise in water- and air-free chemistry using the requisite equipment (e.g., Schlenk line, glove box, etc.) are generally required for successful outcomes.
4.2.1. Anionic ring-opening polymerization of epoxides, aziridines, and azetidines
Epoxides can be polymerized by classical oxyanionic ROP and/or by monomer-activated anionic ROP. The latter technique is most often employed for epoxides bearing substituents incompatible with strong alkoxides, such as epichlorohydrin and epicyanohydrin, and uses initiators that can be transformed via PPM (e.g. azides and halides). Monomers that are amenable to both oxyanionic ROP and monomeractivated anionic ROP can be exploited to obtain copolymers with the same composition but distinct monomer distributions [114]. Anionic ring-opening polymerization (AROP) requires strict exclusion of both water and air, but if carried out expertly polymers can be synthesized on what would be considered large scale by the academic researcher (~100 g). Epoxides bearing allyl [115], propargyl [116], azide [117], halide [118], protected alcohol [119], or nitrile [120] moieties provide excellent handles for subsequent PPM to charged polyethers (Fig. 19). To date there are few reports of PECs [46] or PZs [121,122] with polyether backbones in the literature, presumably attributable to the synthetic barrier that is appreciably higher than for CRPs. The polyetherderived PZs and PECs reported were studied in the contexts of synthetic membranes or block copolyelectrolyte hydrogels, respectively. Recalling the systematic comparison of PEC phase behavior between aliphatic and polypeptide backbones by Li et al. (vide supra), one could complement this study by making poly(ethylene oxides) with carboxylate and primary ammonium side chains via simple PPM of a reactive polyether. Recently, our lab has systematically varied charge fraction in poly(ethylene oxide-stat-allyl glycidyl ether)-derived copolyelectrolytes with a near-random monomer distribution [123] to investigate phase behavior as a function of charge density (Fig. 20). Copolymerization with ethylene oxide allows for the synthesis of low charge fraction copolyelectrolytes (f ~ 0.1) without compromising aqueous solubility of the polymers. Phase behavior and structure of polyelectrolyte complex
coacervates as a function of charge fraction, comparison with predictions from scaling analysis [124], and complementary molecular dynamics simulations capturing strongly charged PECs will be reported in a forthcoming collaborative publication from the de Pablo and our group. The AROP of aziridines and azetidines has been optimized significantly over the past years (Fig. 21) [125]. Polymerization of N-activated unsubstituted or 2-substituted aziridines and N-sulfonylazetidines affords well-defined linear polyamines upon removal of the N-sulfonyl groups [126,127]. Thomi and Wurm reported the successful AROP of an alkene-functionalized N-mesylaziridine, which was subsequently modified using thiol–ene click chemistry [128]. AROP of aziridines or azetidines provides an elegant platform to vary the spacing between backbone amines; the backbone amines and/or other reactive groups can be used for PPM. Further advances in synthetic chemistry will surely expand the palette of reactive aziridines and azetidines compatible with AROP.
4.2.2. Ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters, diesters, carbonates, and hemiacetal esters
Ring-opening polymerization of heterocycles has received much attention over the past decade, in part due to an interest in and commitment towards the development of sustainable and biocompatible materials [129]. ROP often requires organometallic or organic catalysts, with the latter becoming increasingly popular due to the comparative ease of handling and lower toxicity required for the manufacture of biomaterials. Recently, Becker and Wurm comprehensively summarized the suite of heterocycles with unprotected, orthogonally reactive groups amenable to ROP under water-free conditions [130]. We point the interested reader to this excellent review for inspiration as we will confine our discussion here to functional polyesters and polycarbonates. Well-defined polyesters and polycarbonates are popular classes of polymers that can be accessed via ROP of cyclic monomers (Fig. 22A). Over the past decade a number of lactones, cyclic diesters, and cyclic carbonates with reactive functional groups have been synthesized, polymerized, and decorated with desirable moieties by postpolymerization modification [130,131]. Polyester- and polycarbonatebased polycations have been investigated as antimicrobial agents [132–135] and used in gene delivery [136–139]. Maynard and coworkers have investigated polyesters and polycarbonates functionalized with zwitterions via PPM of allyl groups—chemistry developed by Emrick [140,141], Hennink [142], and Storey [143]—in the context of protein stabilization [144,145]. An attractive feature of ROP is that one can systematically alter linear charge density or periodicity of the resultant PEs or PZs by varying ring size. Polymerization of 5-membered lactones is thermodynamically unfavorable, and novel catalysts that circumnavigate this obstacle (e.g., are highly active at low temperatures) are still a topic of intense research. On the other hand, 8–11membered rings are generally difficult to access due to their high ringstrain. Ring-opening polymerization of cyclic hemiacetal esters [146] and hemiketal esters [147] with concurrent expulsion of volatile aldehydes or ketones was reported as an alternative route to polyesters (Fig. 22B). Using this approach, a 5-membered cyclic hemiacetal ester containing a propargyl substituent has been polymerized with polylactide to afford copolymers of lactic acid and propargylated glycolic acid [148].
4.2.3. N-carboxyanhydride Polymerization to yield polypeptides and polypeptoids
Nature produces perfectly monodisperse biomacromolecules and therefore the question of how well the synthetic chemist must match this perfection in emulating natural materials arises. Synthetic chemistry provides access to polymers with variable degrees of control over molar mass distributions and hence is perfectly equipped to tackle this question. Polypeptides can be synthesized by a variety of methods: SSPS provides polymers that are monodisperse, controlled ROP of the

17
analogous N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) yields polymers with narrow molar mass distributions, and polycondensation of amino acids affords polymers with broad molar mass distributions (Fig. 23). Starting with the least controlled polymerization method and subsequently aiming to match the weight-average molar masses (Mw) obtained by the increasingly more controlled routes would provide a suitable avenue for determining the impact polyelectrolyte polydispersity has on complex phase behavior. Furthermore, there are many NCA monomers with
reactive groups for PPM that have yet to be explored for zwitterionic materials [149]; new PZs with peptide backbones would add to the tiny pool of current examples [150–152] and, more importantly, offer valuable comparisons to (meth)acrylamide-derived PZs and (pseudo-) zwitterionic peptides such as poly(lysine-alt-glutamic acid). Polypeptoids and poly(β-peptoids) [153] constitute another intriguing platform for direct comparisons of PEC phase behavior made from structurally similar but distinct PE analogues (Fig. 24. To the best of our knowledge, solution PECs of oppositely charged polypeptoids and their phase behavior has not yet been reported in the literature. The Segalman group has, however, made significant contributions to polypeptoid self-assembly in the melt as well as in solution; [154] a recent collaborative effort also reported hydrogen bonding as the main culprit in surface fouling by a systematic comparison between hydrogen bonding and non-hydrogen bonding polypeptoid-functionalized surfaces [155]. Furthermore, a study using a surface force apparatus has contrasted adhesion and cohesion forces between homologous micaadsorbed polypeptoids and polypeptides [156]. The authors reported differences between the adsorption of the polymers to mica—polypeptides adsorbed as multilayers whereas polypeptoids adsorbed as monolayers. Differences in bare mica–polymer and symmetric polymer–polymer interactions were attributed in part to hydrogenbonding capability and varying degrees of hydration. It would be useful to compare solution phase behavior of complexes of homologous polypeptides and polypeptoids lacking secondary structures to further home in on hydrogen-bonding effects.
4.2.4. Ring-opening metathesis polymerization: Examples of heteroatom backbones
Although ROMP has been used to generate charged polymers, there is significant potential for new systems to be designed and explored. In particular, cyclic unsaturated monomers that contain heteroatoms enable new functionalities to be embedded in the polymer backbone; in some cases, these monomers are also amenable to ROP through other avenues (see Fig. 22). For example, recent reports demonstrated ROMP of unsaturated cyclic acetals, cyclic carbonates, and lactones [157,158]. We note, however, that with the exception of the cyclic carbonate, the monomers do not undergo homopolymerization but can be copolymerized in a perfectly alternating fashion with a suitable comonomer [157]. The cyclic carbonate has been reported to be polymerizable via

18
the carbonate moiety (i.e. ROP); presumably this is the case for cyclic esters as well, although appropriate conditions have not yet been reported. Another potentially useful monomer is the unsaturated crown ether reported by Pelegri-O’Day et al., which would yield poly(ethylene oxide)s with regularly spaced alkenes in the polymer backbone (Fig. 25) [159]. For all polymers made via ROMP, the double bonds in the backbone can be readily functionalized via thiol–ene click chemistry; hence, this presents another valuable strategy to access charged polymers with diverse backbones [160]. Furthermore, multifunctional thiols (with or without ionizable groups) can be tactfully employed as crosslinking and/or surface-anchoring agents for ROMP-derived PEs and PZs.
5. Conclusion
This opinion piece aimed to convey the exciting and insightful recent progress made in elucidating fundamental structure–property relationships of polyelectrolyte complexes and polyzwitterions as well as to provide inspiration for building blocks and polymerization methods we believe will contribute to additional breakthroughs in coming years. Charged polymers, by virtue of being well-represented in natural materials and processes, present the physical scientist with an intriguing window into biology and thereby not only generate appreciation for the world around and within us but also challenge us to design materials that leverage the entire palette of available non-covalent interactions between macromolecules. Scientists and engineers have the opportunity and responsibility to distill a fundamental understanding and to subsequently apply this towards the design of sustainable materials for human and planetary health; what better way to do this than to construct biomimetic materials that will be compatible with our natural environment?
