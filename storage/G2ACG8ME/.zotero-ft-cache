Mechanistic studies of droplet electrophoresis: A review
Electrophoresis (EP) of droplets is an intriguing phenomenon that has applications in biological systems, separation strategies, and reactor engineering. Droplet EP is significantly different from the classic particle EP because of droplet characteristics such as a mobile surface charge and the nonrigidity of the interface. Also, the liquid–liquid system, where there is an interplay between the hydrodynamic and electrokinetic forces in both phases, adds to the complexity of electrophoretic motion. Due to the vast amount of potential applications of droplet EP, a mechanistic understanding of the droplet motion in the presence of an external electric field is crucial. This review provides a background on the mechanism of droplet EP and summarizes the intrinsic interplay between the different relevant forces in these systems. The review also describes the key differences between droplet EP and particle EP, and the impact of these differences on droplet mobility. Additionally, we schematically summarize the effects of key parameters on droplet EP mobility, such as electric double layer polarization, the development of internal flow inside a droplet and boundary effects.

1 Introduction
Transport of droplets is of critical importance in a variety of applications, ranging from biological systems to energy recovery and chemical reaction engineering. Control of droplet transport by means of electric fields is an interesting avenue for (energy) industry to separate water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions for upstream dehydration and downstream desalting operations [1] as well as tailing ponds treatment [2], for antipollution technologies to remove emulsified oil from produced water [3]. Additionally, droplet transport in electric fields is relevant in biomedical and biochemical applications to separate DNA, RNA, amino acids, and protein molecules [4, 5], for chromatography science to separate neutral or charged analytes in microemulsion electrokinetic capillary chromatography [6] and in the food industry to separate and quantify toxins [7]. In order to apply this technology, a mechanistic description of the electrophoresis (EP) of droplets is required. Any surface, including that of particles and droplets, in contact with an electrolyte solution exhibits electric charges. These surface charges are screened by ions of opposite charge

in the electrolyte, forming an electric double layer (EDL) adjacent to the surface [8]. As the name suggests, the EDL consists of two layers. The first layer is the so-called Stern or Helmholtz layer, which consists of immobile counterions strongly interacting with the surface [8, 9]. The counterions in this layer typically cannot fully compensate the surface charge because the number of ions at the surface is limited by the ionic radius. Consequently, a second, diffuse layer is formed consisting of both counterions and co-ions, as described in the Gouy–Chapman theory [10]. The Debye length (λD = κ−1), the characteristic thickness of the EDL, is calculated using Eq. (1) [11]. In this equation kB is Boltzmann’s constant (J/K), T is the absolute temperature (K), e denotes the electron charge, z is the ionic valence of N ionic species, ci represents the concentration of different ions in the liquid (mol/m3), and εr and ε0 are the permittivity of the medium and vacuum (C2/N · m2), respectively. The thickness of the EDL decreases with increasing ionic strength of the electrolyte. The electric potential at the slipping plane between the Stern layer and the diffuse layer is called the ζ -potential. This potential is usually treated as the effective surface charge and is influenced by the ionic concentration and the pH of the bulk solution [12, 13]:

pressure gradient (hydrodynamic force) [15], a temperature gradient (thermophoretic diffusion) [16], a concentration gradient (molecular diffusion) [17], or a gravity field (gravity force) [18]. As a result of the ions moving, the surrounding fluid will be dragged along, resulting in the motion of fluid, droplets or particles in the system. Depending on the moving phase and the type of driving force, different electrokinetic phenomena can be observed [19, 20].
1.1 Electroosmosis and electrophoresis
When an electric field is applied to a system, the excess counterions in the diffuse layer of the EDL will move toward the electrode of opposite charge and drag the liquid along, leading to an EOF as schematically shown in Fig. 1A [12, 13]. The velocity of the fluid increases from zero at the interface (no-slip boundary condition) to the maximum value over the width of the EDL adjacent to the wall. In channels with a characteristic dimension of micrometers or larger, the EDL thickness is small compared to the channel dimension and as a result, the velocity profile of EOF is considered plug flow throughout the channel. The electroosmotic velocity can be obtained from Smoluchowski’s theorem using Eq. (2) [21, 22]. The EOF velocity is linearly proportional to the wall surface potential (ζwall), applied electric field (V/m), viscosity of the medium (η), as well as the electric permittivity of the medium:
veo = − εrε0
η ζwallE. (2)
Under the influence of an external electric field, a charged particle or droplet moves toward the electrode with the opposite charge as shown in Fig. 1B [23–25]. This phenomenon is called EP and was first introduced by Peter Ivanovich Strakhov and Ferdinand Frederic Reuss in 1807, when they observed that applying an electric field resulted in the motion of clay particles in water [14]. EP is used in a wide
variety of applications, such as chemical analysis [26], biology [27], soil remediation [28], ion detection [29], and water purification [30]. Traditionally, most EP research is focused on particles in colloidal systems [23, 31–34], however, over the recent decades, the separation of oil–water emulsions using electric fields has gained attention due to its relatively low environmental impact [30, 35–38]. EP of droplets is more complicated than particle EP because of specific characteristics of droplets such as mobile surface charges [39], a flexible interface, and slip velocities on their surface [40]. The possibility of internal flows inside droplets adds further complexity to the description of droplet EP mobility [41]. Several researchers have investigated the influence of these parameters on droplet mobility [40, 42–44]. The overall complexity and potential applications of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions in different operations such as treatment of tailing ponds [2], enhanced oil recovery [1], and pharmaceutical industry [45] in the food and pharmaceutical industry, oil recovery, and separation technologies warrant this review on droplet EP. In this paper, we mostly focus on EP of single droplets, which are present in dilute emulsions. We will first briefly introduce the topic through a historical and theoretical background in which important definitions are set. Then, we will compare droplet EP to the more classical particle EP, before we elaborate on the parameters influencing the EP mobility of droplets.
2 A short background on EP
There are two main theories to obtain the EP mobility of particles depending on the ionic strength of the solution, proposed by Smoluchowski in 1903 [22] and Hückel in 1924 [46]. At high ionic concentration, when the EDL thickness is small, the Smoluchowski equation (Eq. (3)) is used to describe the EP mobility of particles (μep in μm2/V·s) [22]:
μep = εrε0
η ζp. (3)
In this theory, a spherical particle of radius a with a constant surface charge moves in a high concentration electrolyte in the presence of an electric field. Because of the high ionic strength, the Debye length is considered significantly smaller than the particle radius (κ−1  a or κa  1). The inertial term in the Navier–Stokes equations is neglected because of the low Reynolds number (Stokes’ regime). This theory is generally applicable to particles with low ζ -potential (ζ  50 mV) moving under the influence of a relatively weak electric field [22]. The EP velocity is then obtained by multiplication of the mobility by the applied electric field [12, 47, 48]. The overall electrokinetic velocity of a particle is obtained by the summation of EP and EOF velocity as in Eq. (4). This equation describes the velocity of a particle in case of a thin EDL under the influence of an electric field [12]. The EOF can either increase or decrease the total velocity depending on whether it is in the same direction with the EP velocity or opposite to it,

based on the respective signs of the wall and droplet charge [49]:
vek = vep + veo = − εrε0
η E (ζwall − ζ p ). (4)
In 1924, Hückel [46] found that the EP mobility of particles was reduced when the EDL thickness was larger than the particle size (κ−1  a or κa  1). He presented Eq. (5) to calculate EP mobility for this situation. This equation is obtained by a force balance between Stokes’ drag force and the electrostatic forces. Several assumptions are made in this theory: (1) the electrolyte completely dissociates into ions in the solution; (2) electrolytes are very dilute, usually in the order of 0.01 M or less; (3) ions are considered spherical and are not polarized by the surrounding electric field; and (4) the ion-solvent interactions are ignored [12, 46–48]. The assumptions in this theory are a significant simplification of actual systems. For example, a dissociation factor should be considered, as a lowconcentration electrolyte cannot be fully dissociated, particularly when ions of higher charge are present in the system [50]. Additionally, the polarization of some ions such as nitrate ions, NO−3, should have been taken into account in this theory:
μep = 2εrε0
3η ζp. (5)
In 1930, Henry [51] conducted research to investigate the influence of particle shape on EP mobility. His results showed that the Smoluchowski equation is applicable for any particle shape. Other studies also have shown that the Smoluchowski equation is not dependent on the shape of the particles [34, 52, 53] as well as their conductivity [54]. Henry presented a general equation to describe the EP mobility of spherical and cylindrical particles as Eq. (6), which can be read as a combination of both Smoluchowski’s and Hückel’s theories:
μep = εrε0
η ζp f (κa). (6)
In this equation f (κa) is Henry’s function, which depends on the EDL thickness (κ−1) and particle radius, making Eq. (6) valid for a wide range of κa [55]. He found that for κa > 300, f (κa) can be approximated to be 1 and in this regime his equation reduces to Smoluchowski’s description of EP mobility. For 0.5 < κa < 300, f (κa) decreases to 2
3 and Henry’s equation reduces to the Debye–Hückel equation [51]. A common assumption in the above described theories is EDL symmetry. In reality, the motion of ions in the EDL as well as the motion of the particle itself disturb EDL symmetry. This means that the EDL thickness may vary around the particle, which can in turn affect the EP mobility. Several studies have shown that the polarization of the EDL around a particle results in a retarding force on the particle, opposite to the force imposed by the external electric field [34, 56, 57]. It has been found that the ζ -potential of the particle has a large influence on the retarding force when compared to the strength of the external electric field. Increasing ζ -potential results in further polarization of the EDL and consequently the imposed retarding force on it. When ζ  50 mV, models pre
sented by O’Brien and White [34] or Dukhin and Semenikhin [58] are more efficient to describe the EP mobility of particles if symmetrical electrolytes are used in the system [19]. Overbeek [56] and Booth [59] showed that for 0.2 < κa < 50, a correction factor should be considered in the current EP equations to describe the EP mobility. O’Brien et al. [34] observed that by increasing the ion valence in the electrolyte, the retarding force increased at constant ζ -potential.
3 Droplet versus particle EP
Droplet EP is distinctly different from the previously described particle EP as a result of droplet characteristics such as mobile surface charges, the presence of surfactants and deformability of the interface. In contrast to the surface charges of solid particles, surface charges of droplets are mobile [35, 39], implying that ions can be distributed nonuniformly on the droplet surface. Therefore, the EDL around the droplets is not a priori symmetric. It is worth mentioning that significant EDL polarization is also present in some classes of particles, such as dielectric particles. These particles are polarized under the influence of an electric field and as result, the distribution of the ions in the EDL will change [60, 61]. Another difference is that droplets are often stabilized by surface active components, such as surfactants [62] or nanoparticles [63], which significantly alter the interfacial characteristics and has a nonnegligible effect on the EP phenomenon. Additionally, at the droplet surface, a tangential component of the velocity field exists, while at particle surfaces, the no-slip boundary condition holds [35, 40, 59, 64]. The slip velocity boundary condition leads to the formation of a velocity field inside the droplet affecting the EP mobility [41, 44]. These differences have to be taken into account to accurately describe droplet EP, and will be further elaborated upon next. Generally speaking, droplets move faster, compared to rigid particles with similar ζ -potential, because of a smaller effective hydrodynamic drag force exerted on them [41, 44, 65, 66].
3.1 The effect of a mobile interface
Different studies have shown that surface charges at the liquid–liquid interface are mobile [55, 67–71]. Due to the mobility of the surface charges, the surface charge density, and consequently, the surface electrostatic potential can change locally on a droplet, which in turn affects the EDL forces [69, 72–75]. The nonuniform distribution of surface charges leads to EDL polarization as schematically shown in Fig. 2. The impact of EDL polarization, also referred to as relaxation or retardation, on the EP mobility of droplets has been studied over the last decades [44, 67, 68, 76, 77]. In general, polarization of the EDL reduces the mobility of the droplets [44, 76] as it induces a local electric field at the droplet opposite to the externally applied electric field. With increasing ζ -potential, more surface charges will be redistributed and therefore, the surface potential gradient

Figure 2. Schematic representation of charge redistribution around a negatively charged droplet in an electrolyte (A) before and (B) after applying an external electric field. The egg-like shape demonstrates the nonuniformity of the ion cloud around the droplet, as charges are unevenly distributed around the droplet. As a result of charge redistribution, a retarding force is exerted on the droplet.
on the droplet will increase. As a result, a stronger retarding force will be exerted on the droplet leading to a reduction of its mobility [41, 78]. It has been shown that EDL polarization is significant for κa ∼ 1 and the influence will be reduced for lower or higher values of κa [44, 49, 79]. For small κa, the ion density in the relatively large EDL is low, reducing the effective induced field, while, in the case of a large κa, the polarization of the EDL is negligible due to the small thickness of the EDL [79]. Additionally, EDL polarization is dependent on the strength of the applied electric field. In the case of a weak external electric field, EDL polarization can be neglected [35, 80]. Different theoretical expressions have been presented to describe the EP mobility of droplets considering EDL polarization [35, 39, 55]. Ohshima et al. [35, 55] obtained an equation in which the EP mobility of mercury droplets in water is dependent on the viscosity ratio between the droplet and the surrounding liquid. This expression is applicable for droplets with high conductivity compared to the surrounding electrolyte with low ζ -potential for various ranges of κa [55]. For droplets with large viscosity (η −→ ∞), their equation agrees with Henry’s equation (Eq. (6)) and for large κa, it is in agreement with the one derived by Levine and O’Brien [39], indicating that in these situations the EDL polarization becomes negligible. EP of droplets with arbitrary ζ -potential and EDL thickness under a weak electric field was studied by Baygents et al. [65]. Their results indicated that droplets do not necessarily move in the anticipated direction based on the sign of their surface charge. It was shown that, in contrast to only considering the tangential stresses from the electric field, the net stress on the droplet should be considered in the prediction of the droplet mobility and the direction of movement. This net stress results from a combination of electrostatic, electrokinetic, Marangoni, and viscous translation forces. The Marangoni effect is observed when droplet stabilizers, such as surfactant molecules or nanoparticles, distribute nonuniformly on the droplet surface resulting in an interfacial tension gradient on the droplet surface. Electrochemical gradients arising at the droplet interface will result

in Marangoni stresses, especially for low conducting droplets [65]. The Marangoni stresses lead to migration of the surfactant molecules or nanoparticles and consequently, the redistribution of the ions in the EDL, as shown in Fig. 3. The mobility will increase if the Marangoni force is in the same direction as the force on the droplet resulting from the electric field [65]. Additionally, their study showed that at high ζ -potential, the EP mobility of the droplet is no longer dependent on the droplet viscosity [65]. This phenomenon was called “solidification,” which alludes to the droplets acting like a solid sphere [55], in which the EDL polarization is suppressed , which is in line with the previously discussed results of Ohshima et al. [35]. This is because, as the surface charge density increases (high ζ -potential), the mobility of charges on droplet surface becomes more difficult, especially in the case of thin EDL, due to the electrostatic forces between charges on the droplet surface.
3.1.1 Systems with interacting droplets
When looking at multiple droplets in a concentrated dispersion with small κa, the mobility of individual droplets is affected by the interaction between different droplets. Generally, the mobility decreases with increasing surface potential [41, 77] as by increasing the ζ -potential, the EDL polarization and consequently the internal retarding force becomes increasingly important. Additionally, the EDL of different droplets overlaps as shown in Fig. 4, leading to a reduction in their mobility. By overlapping the EDLs, the droplets move together and consequently, a larger drag force will be exerted on them since they act like a larger sized entity, compared to a single droplet. By increasing the number of droplets in the system, the possibility of EDLs overlapping will increase, and as a result, the mobility of the droplets decreases, because of the neighboring droplet–droplet EDL interactions. When κa approaches infinity, the EDL thickness is very thin and the influence of the neighboring droplets becomes insignificant [41, 77].

3.1.2 Theoretical descriptions of droplet charge distribution
To understand the local distribution of charges on the droplet interface in the presence of an external electric field, different theoretical models have been proposed [64, 69, 75, 81]. Li et al. [81] were the first to quantitatively investigate the redistribution of surface charges on an oil droplet. Their results showed that by independently increasing the droplet radius, electric field strength, and initial surface charge, the redistribution of charges is enhanced. Additionally, they presented an analytical expression for the local ζ -potential on the oil droplet as a function of these parameters, which was in good agreement with their experimental data. Ichikawa [69, 74] presented another model based on the relation between the local electrostatic potential and the surface charge density. Three assumptions were made to derive this model; (1) both positive and negative ions exist at the same time on the droplet surface, (2) the EDL thickness is much smaller than the droplet size, and (3) the total number of positive and negative ions at the interface remains constant throughout. According to this model, negative and positive surface charges can occupy different sides of the droplet under the influence of an electric field. Their results provided a theoretical explanation for potential energy required for the demulsification of O/W emulsions using an electric field. In this study, instead of using the Poisson–Boltzmann equation [82], the Poisson–Smoluchowski diffusion equation [83] was used, since it can be applied to a system with ion current under the influence of an electric field. The assumptions required for the development of this model are often not justified for practices. First, it is known that the droplet surface, in a neutral electrolyte (pH = 7), is usually negatively charged because of the adsorption of hydroxyl ions; produced by dissociation–association equilibrium of the water molecules [37, 84]. Second, the migration of surface ions, because of the applied electric field, leads to reduction of surface charges at specific area of the droplet. If the ion concentration at some places of the oil droplet surface falls below the initial equilibrium condition, new surface charges

Because of this current, the liquid around the droplet will be dragged leading to formation of an EOF around it (black arrow). The space charge, represented in blue around the droplet, indicates the net charge in the EDL.
would be produced until equilibrium. So, the total number of the surface charges will not be constant [81]. Another model, originating from the field of biology, describes the surface charge density depending on the external electric field, thermal potential, and the radius of a charged species [64, 75]. The thermal potential is the potential energy at atomic and molecular levels that has the potential to be converted to thermal kinetic energy (φ = 25.7 mV at 25◦C). In this model, the total number of surface ions has been considered constant which cannot be justified practically for most liquid–liquid systems as mentioned previously. Therefore, its application is limited to some biological systems to study the redistribution of charged molecules on cells. In this study, a description for the cell EP velocity by considering mobile surface charges was obtained as well [64].
3.2 Surface slip velocity
Unlike for particles, a slip velocity exists at the droplet interface [35]. Several researchers have studied EP of droplets considering this condition [35, 40, 59, 64]. Booth et al. [59] presented a general analytical expression to describe the EP velocity of a spherical droplet with low ζ -potential. Different EP velocity expressions can be derived from their equation for different ranges of κa. In these studies, a symmetric EDL thickness was considered for the droplet. The slip velocity at the droplet–liquid interface induces a nonhomogeneous surface flow at the droplet surface called surface conduction (SC). The SC results in a flux of ions transverse to the EDL as shown in Fig. 5 [58, 78, 85]. Due to the mobile surface charges on the droplet surface, and thus the corresponding ion concentration polarization in the EDL, the excess ions in the EDL move under the influence of the external electric field. The migration of ions in the EDL drag the liquid around the droplet leading to formation of an EOF, opposite to the EP direction as schematically exhibited in Fig. 5.

Therefore, the SC has a retarding effect on the droplet EP mobility. The SC can be quantified using the Dukhin number, which is a dimensionless parameter scaling the average

Kma [58].
The influence of SC on EP mobility of a charged droplet was studied by Bhattacharryya et al. [78]. They showed that by decreasing the viscosity of the droplet and increasing the thickness of the EDL, SC is increased. This is due to the easier motion of the surface charges on the droplet surface and consequently, the ions in the EDL. It was indicated that in the case of a high slip velocity boundary condition at the droplet–liquid interface, the impact of EDL polarization on the mobility of the droplet reduces. By increasing the slip velocity, the SC at the droplet surface increases, and thus the EDL polarization will be reduced. An additional consequence of the presence of a slip velocity at the droplet surface is internal flows within the droplet [41, 44, 65, 78, 86]. As the electrolyte outside the droplet is moving, liquid molecules inside the droplet start moving due to the viscous forces at the interface. The liquid inside the droplet is confined and as a result, two counterrotating internal vortices form as shown in Fig. 6. This internal flow will decrease the drag force at the droplet–electrolyte interface. So, the EP mobility of the droplets would be higher compared to the particles with similar ζ -potential [41, 44, 65, 66].
4 Parameters influencing droplet EP mobility
As was alluded to in the previous section, there are a large variety of parameters that have an influence on the EP mobility of droplets. These parameters include the surface charge of the droplet [36, 76, 87, 88], pH [89], internal flow in the droplets [41, 44, 65, 78], the viscosity ratio of the dispersed and continuous phase [44, 57], droplet size, surface charge of the channel wall [44, 90], electric field strength, [73, 91–93], as well as the boundary effects [44]. A generalized summary of the effect of these parameters on the droplet EP mobility and velocity is shown in Table 1, together with potential methods to measure these parameters. Generally, by increasing the droplet size, the drag force exerted on

The FD is imposed by the continuous phase on the droplet.
the droplet will increase and consequently, EP mobility will decrease [64]. Droplet size can be measured using dynamic light scattering techniques. By increasing the droplet size at a fixed charge density, the net charge of the droplet increases, and consequently the double layer polarization will be intensified leading to enhancement of the retardation effect. This leads to decreasing the EP mobility of the droplet [78]. Next, we will elaborate on the most important parameters and their impact on droplet EP mobility.
4.1 Surface charge of the droplet
The surface charge of the droplet plays an important role in the intensity and direction of droplet EP [20, 38]. The surface charge of a droplet can be measured using standardized ζ -potential measurements. The surfactant type in the system [76, 88], or the nature of the interface-stabilizing nanoparticles [94, 95], pH [12, 38, 87], and ionic strength of the solution [96, 97] are contributing factors to the apparent surface charge or ζ -potential at the droplet interface. The influence of different surfactants (anionic, cationic, and amphoteric) on ζ -potential [96–98] and EP mobility of droplets has been investigated in several studies [36, 90, 99]. Initially, the droplet interface in an O/W emulsion exhibits a negative surface charge. It has been shown that, by adsorption of surfactant molecules at the droplet interface in O/W emulsions, the surface charge of the oil droplet changes and consequently the intensity of the EP mobility or the direction of motion is affected. Increasing the concentration of cationic surfactants changes the initially negative surface charge at the oil–water interface to a less negative value, and can even lead to charge sign reversal [96]. Contrarily, by increasing the concentration of anionic surfactants, the already negative surface charge becomes more negative. In these studies, the maximum surface charge was observed near the CMC of surfactants and reached a plateau at higher concentrations [96–98].

Using an experimental study, Tuvcek et al. [36] showed that the EP mobility of an oil droplet is proportional to the logarithm of the surfactant concentration. Studying the EP mobility of water droplets in nonpolar media, without surfactants, showed that water droplets usually have a positive surface charge and move toward the negative electrode [100, 101]. It has been indicated that the molecular structure of the oil medium influences the orientation of the water molecules at the interface and consequently the droplet surface charge [102]. For example, compared to paraffin oil, the affinity of water molecules to a silicone oil interface was different because of the presence of electronegative oxygen atoms in the oil [43, 102]. However, it has been reported that in gasoline, the water droplets move toward the positive electrode indicating their negative surface charge [103]. Studies have also revealed that in W/O emulsions stabilized by anionic surfactant, by increasing the surfactant concentration, the surface charge of the water droplets decreases and can become negative around the CMC. Additionally, the surface charge of the water droplet in the oil phase has been shown independent of the ionic strength and the pH of the continuous phase [43, 102]. By molecular dynamics simulations, Knecht et al. [104] showed that the dipolar ordering of the water molecules on the oil droplet as the dispersed phase contributes to the direction of the droplet motion. If the “positive ends” in water molecules interact directly with the oil droplet, the “negative end” will be subjected to the continuous phase. So, the surface of the droplet will be negatively charged and it can move to the positive electrode. Also, analyzing the EP behavior of hydrocarbon droplets with different polar groups showed that the mobility of the droplet is dependent on the charge of the end groups in hydrocarbon molecules
[89, 105]. The end groups are the groups directed to the continuous phase when the droplet is placed in it. If the end groups are negatively charged, the adsorption of hydroxyl ions, produced by dissociation–association equilibrium of the water molecules on the oil droplet, decreases. This is due to the repulsive force between the hydroxyl ions and the negatively charged end groups of the oil molecules. So, the surface charge and consequently, EP mobility decrease. Studying the influence of pH on ζ -potential at oil–water interfaces has showed that OH− or H3O+ can adsorb at the interface and as a result, the surface charge will change [89]. For example, by increasing the acidity of the solution, the interaction of H3O+ ions with the interface can change the surface charge to less negative values or even positive values depending on the H3O+ concentration [84]. Consequently, the sign of EP mobility as well as its intensity will change [37]. Increasing the pH can lead to a more negative surface charge on the oil droplet and increasing its mobility [37, 38, 84, 87]. A pHdependent equation to describe the ζ -potential of the droplets in O/W emulsion has been reported in [99]. Evaluating the impact of nanoparticles on the electrokinetic motion of droplets in Pickering emulsions (nanoparticle-stabilized emulsions) has shown that by changing the concentration of nanoparticles on the droplet surface, the ζ -potential of the droplet will change. For example, if the nanoparticles and the droplet are both negatively charged, by increasing the concentration of the nanoparticles, the absolute value of the droplet’s ζ -potential will increase leading to an increase in its mobility; otherwise, the droplet mobility will decrease [106]. In addition, it has been indicated that by applying an electric field, the nanoparticles move on the droplet surface[106–108]. So, the surface coverage of the droplets by nanoparticles will change, which affects the

droplet mobility due to the nonuniform distribution of the ions in the EDL, as was described before. The ionic strength or salinity of the electrolyte also affects the ζ -potential at the droplet–electrolyte interface through interference with the surfactants. It has been shown that the addition of salt to the solution impacts the adsorption of surfactants on the oil droplet surface and consequently its surface charge [96, 97]. The Grahame equation (Eq. (7)), which is derived from the Gouy–Chapman theory, represents the relation between the interfacial charge density, σ , ζ -potential, and ionic strength of the electrolyte [109]. In this equation, R is the universal gas constant (J/mol · K) and c∞ is the concentration of ions in the bulk solution (mol/m3). At low ionic concentrations, the increase of σ usually offsets the increase of c∞, so the ζ -potential increases. But, at high ionic concentrations, enhancement of c∞ decreases the ζ -potential [96]. However, the influence of surfactants or nanoparticles on ζ potential is much stronger, compared to the influence of the salinity of the continuous phase:
σ = √8RT εε0c∞ sinh
( zeζ 2kBT
)
. (7)
It has been shown that at high ζ -potential, by increasing or decreasing the ionic strength and consequently changing the EDL thickness, the EP mobility can reach a minimum [49]. This stems from the influence of the EDL polarization on the droplet mobility. Therefore, it is important to adjust the electrolyte concentration to avoid mobility reduction, when possible. By increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte, the EDL thickness is decreased and the electrical potential gradient ( ζ
λD ) on the droplet surface will be larger. This creates
higher electric driving force and as a result, the EP mobility of the droplet increases [66]. Bailes et al. [103] showed that by increasing the conductivity of the continuous phase in W/O emulsions, the amplitude of the water droplet motion decreases, because of the reduction in the electric field strength. For high ζ -potential cases (ζ  250 mV), it has been shown that the classical equations, such as the PoissonBoltzmann equation, are not valid for EP mobility measurements. This is because, by increasing the ζ -potential, EDL polarization is significant enough to cause deviation from the classical theories. [41, 44, 78]. Also, the ion current in the presence of an electric field is not considered in this equation [83]. As such, the evaluation of the EP mobility of droplets is usually carried out for lower values of ζ -potential [34, 110].
4.2 Surface charge of the channel wall
The ζ -potential of the channel wall also affects the EP mobility of the droplets. As most of the channel walls are inherently negatively charged, for the case of a droplet with negative surface charges, the direction of the EOF and the EP will be opposite to each other. So, EOF will reduce the EP mobility of the droplet [76]. In the presence of surfactants in the system, the interaction between the surfactant molecules and the wall will also have an influence on the
apparent EP mobility of the droplets. Adsorption of surfactant molecules on the channel wall impacts the magnitude of the wall surface charge and sometimes its sign. For example, the adsorption of a cationic surfactant on a negatively charged channel wall can change its surface charge to positive values depending on the concentration of surfactant. Consequently, the intensity and the direction of the EOF exerted on the droplet can change, affecting the droplet EP mobility [44, 90]. Determination of the surface charge of (micro)channel walls can be done by measuring electroosmotic permeability of the channels or by using streaming potential measurements.
4.3 Vortices in and around droplets
The development of internal flow inside droplets, as a result of the slip arising from the flow field outside the droplet, is a known phenomenon in droplet transport [41, 44, 65, 78, 86]. As mentioned previously, vortices are formed as a consequence of continuous velocity field at the droplet–electrolyte interface [41, 44, 65, 66, 111]. This internal flow reduces the hydrodynamic drag force exerted on the droplets leading to an increase in their EP mobility, compared to particles with similar ζ -potential. Due to this internal flow, the general Smoluchowski and Debye–Hückel theories fail to accurately describe EP of droplets [112]. The existence of flow fields inside the droplet makes studying EP of droplets more complex, since the electrokinetic equations need to be considered for both liquid phases, inside and outside the droplet [66]. The fluid velocity inside the droplet has been shown to be sensitive to the droplet viscosity and is linearly dependent on the EOF around the droplet (as described in Section 3.2) [113, 114]. Vortices also have been observed around a droplet under the influence of an external electric field [41, 76]. The nonuniform distribution of surface charges on the droplets as well as the slip velocity boundary condition at the droplet–electrolyte interface are postulated to lead to creation of these vortices. As a result of the redistribution of surface charges in the electric field, part of the droplet will have a relatively low (pseudoneutral) surface charge. Consequently, there is no EOF at that part of the droplet interface, essentially resulting in an apparent no-slip boundary condition on that part of the droplet. The part of the droplet that still exhibits a surface charge will accommodate EOF and thus have a slip velocity at the interface. At the location where these boundary conditions intersect, there will be a stagnation point, resulting in the development of vortices at the outer vicinity of the droplets [76]. This phenomenon has been shown in Fig. 6. These external vortices increase the drag force on the droplet and consequently, reducing its EP motion. The strength and location of these vortices is dependent on the surface charge of the droplet as well as the electric field strength [41, 76, 115]. By increasing either the surface charge, the field strength or both, the strength of the vortices increases and the droplet mobility will decrease.

4.4 Viscosity
The viscosity of both dispersed and continuous phases has an influence on the EP mobility. As the viscosity of the droplet increases, the droplet increasingly behaves like a rigid particle and therefore, the EP mobility decreases [44, 57, 66, 78, 116]. Huang et al. [44] showed that by decreasing the viscosity of the droplet, its mobility increases as the hydrodynamic drag force exerted at the liquid–liquid interface decreases. They also demonstrated that when the EDL is thin and the viscosity of the droplet is low, the EP mobility is dependent on the droplet size. Bhattacharyya et al. [78] found that when the EDL thickness is in the order of the droplet size and the viscosity of the droplet is smaller than the surrounding liquid, the EP velocity changes nonlinearly with the strength of the applied electric field. By increasing the viscosity of the electrolyte, the drag force exerted on the droplet will increase, leading to reduction of the droplet mobility [57]. Additionally, EP of non-Newtonian droplets is of interest for applications that involve, for instance, polymer processing or biological fluids [77, 117, 118]. Theoretical studies have shown that when the EDL thickness is thin, the nature of the non-Newtonian droplet becomes influential on its mobility. The drag force exerted on a droplet in a Newtonian liquid lies between the drag force on a gas bubble (FD = 4π ηav) and the drag force on a rigid particle (FD = 6π ηav) [119]. In contrast to the case of thick EDL, the potential gradient ( ζ
λD )
in the thin EDL is large and as a result, the droplet moves faster leading to an increasing drag force on the droplet. By increasing the magnitude of the drag force, the influence of the shear-thinning nature of the droplet becomes important, as its viscosity can further decrease. Therefore, by increasing the shear-thinning nature of the droplet, the EP mobility typically increases. This is because as the droplet viscosity decreases, it is more easily deformed and the hydrodynamic drag imposed on that will decrease; so, the droplet moves faster [77, 118]. In these studies, the Carreau model was used to describe the properties of the dispersed phase, and the continuous phase was considered a Newtonian fluid. Lee et al. [77] theoretically showed that for a concentrated dispersion of non-Newtonian droplets, by increasing κa, the mobility of the droplet increases as was the case for the Newtonian droplets. This is due to the larger potential gradient in the EDL. In the case of κa  1 (thick EDL), a retarding force will be exerted on the droplet, because of the interaction between the neighboring droplets’ EDLs, and consequently, the mobility decreases. It was shown that for an average EDL thickness, the mobility reduces by increasing the number of droplets in the system. Khair et al. [117] theoretically showed that unlike Newtonian fluids, the EP velocity of particles in non-Newtonian fluids is dependent on their size and shape in case of thin EDL.
4.5 Electric field
As can be seen from the classic equations for EP velocity, by increasing the electric field strength, the velocity of the
droplet increases linearly due to the enhancement of the electrostatic force imposed on the droplet [41, 44, 65, 66]. However, it has been showed that when the EDL thickness is in the order of the droplet size, the EP velocity can change nonlinearly with the electric field [78]. By increasing the intensity of the electric field, as mentioned previously, EDL polarization as well as the internal electric field (retarding force) can become more important, depending on the EDL thickness and the ζ -potential on the droplet surface. Therefore, the droplet mobility can increase or decrease [44, 76]. Ichikawa et al. [69, 72–74] showed that because of migration of ions on the droplet surface, the EDL forces, essential in preventing droplet coalescence, are partially reduced on the droplet surface, allowing attractive Van der Waals forces to become dominant, leading to droplets coalescence. In Pickering emulsions, by enhancing the electric field strength, the electrokinetic mobility of droplets increases nonlinearly [107] because of the changes in the droplet surface coverage by nanoparticles, due to the applied electric field.
4.6 Boundary effects
Different numerical and experimental studies have been done to investigate the boundary effects on the electrokinetic motion of the particles and the droplets near a solid surface [66, 120–125]. Apart from the EP force and the hydrodynamic forces (resulting from EOF) exerted on a droplet moving at the wall, the flow frictional resistance against the translational motion of the droplet affects its mobility [120]. This flow resistance is inversely proportional to the gap size between the droplet and channel wall. When the droplet has lower density compared to the continuous phase, by increasing the droplet size, the buoyancy force will increase and as a result, the gap between the droplet and the wall decreases. So, the flow resistance against the translational motion increases leading to lower mobility of the droplet [120]. Changing the ζ -potential of the solid–liquid interface also influences the droplet electrokinetic velocity by affecting the EOF [120]. The contribution of boundary effects on EP of a droplet becomes significant particularly in the case of a thick double layer [44, 79], as the channel may squeeze the EDL of the droplets moving near the wall and the droplet moves slower. In this case, the droplet mobility can decrease further by increasing the droplet ζ -potential due to the EDL polarization and the induced internal electric field in the EDL opposite to the external electric field. By increasing the ratio of the droplet size to the channel size, the electric field will be increasingly squeezed in the space between the channel wall and the droplet, and consequently the local electric field strength will be enhanced. This results in a dielectrophoretic force as well as a stronger EOF exerted on the droplet, leading to an increase in its mobility. On the contrary, the retardation force exerted on the droplet in this region will reduce the droplet EP motion. Therefore, depending on the strength of these forces, the EP mobility of the droplet can increase or decrease [106].

Several studies have investigated the mobility of droplets at an air–liquid interface [116, 126, 127]. This is relevant for applications such as EP of oil droplets near the air–water interface, in oil and water separation [126]. Unlike the solidliquid interface, the gas–liquid interface is mobile, which influences the flow behavior differently. Similar to solid surfaces, an EDL exists at air–liquid interface [70, 127, 128]. As mentioned previously, because of the density difference, the droplet moves toward the air–water interface and reaches an equilibrium distance from the interface. By introducing an external electric field to the system, the local electric field in the thin area between the droplet and the interface will be distributed nonuniformly compared to other parts of the system and the electric field lines will be squeezed in this region. As such, a dielectrophoretic force will act on the droplet affecting its mobility. Wang et al. [126] showed that by increasing the droplet size, the mobility increases. This is because the buoyancy force exerted on the droplet will be larger and so, the gap between the droplet and the air–liquid interface decreases. As a result, the electric field lines will be further squeezed in this region, leading to enhancement of the local electric field strength and thus, the droplet moves faster. In this study, the ζ -potential of the air–water interface and the oil–water interface influenced the electrokinetic mobility of the droplet, similar to the solid–liquid system. Liao et al. [116] showed that in case of a thick double layer, the droplet mobility deceases. They explained that when the thick EDL around the oil droplet touches the air–water interface, the distribution of the ions will change in the EDL due to the deformation of the EDL. As a result, the electric driving force will decrease, leading to EP mobility reduction. As the droplet gets closer to the air–water interface, it also displaces the fluid entities in front, toward the interface, and the pushback from the interface leads to formation of vortex around the droplet. Due to the formation of the vortex flow near the droplet, the mobility of the droplet usually reduces.
5 Potential for future research
As was described, the electrophoretic motion of emulsions is much more complex than that of rigid particles, as it depends on various droplet-exclusive parameters such as slip flow and the flexible nature of the interface. The coupling of the different effects described in this review, and the coupled influence on the behavior of droplets in externally applied electric fields is a topic of ongoing research. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that systematically include the combined effects of liquid–liquid interface phenomena and their interplay, on droplet EP. In the practical applications, there are various additional intricate phenomena such as Marangoni stresses, droplet polydispersity, the development of (vortical) flow inside and outside of the droplet, and variable droplet size due to Ostwald ripening, to name a few, which need to be addressed. The impacts of theses phenomena are interdependent, which adds to the complexity of the droplet EP. A com
bined experimental and theoretical approach to fully couple these effects and compare predictions to measurements is required for a complete understanding of the dominant mechanisms/phenomena under different system conditions. Quantification of local parameters such as the surfactant concentration, ionic strength, and electric field strength would further unravel the mechanisms of droplet EP. Additionally, the EP of non-Newtonian droplets, or droplets in non-Newtonian media is of high relevance for many biological and energy applications. To date, research questions on EP in non-Newtonian media are relatively unexplored and experimental, numerical, and theoretical research are to be done to accelerate the potential application of electric field-aided transport in these applications.
