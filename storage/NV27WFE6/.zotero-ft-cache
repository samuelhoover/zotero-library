Introduction
Droplets formed by reactions between positive and negative colloids have been investigated (1-4) mainly with natural polyelectrolytes such as proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. The liquid droplets, called "coacervate droplets", are formed even in a very dilute solution (1), and selectively absorb and condense materials from the outer solution. Droplets have interactions with the medium, though they have distinct boundaries from the surrounding medium. In the coacervate droplets, biological reactions such as oxydation, reduction, polymerization, hydrolysis, etc. are known to be accelerated (5). Features of coacervate droplets may relate with the origin of prebiological systems (6), and the morphology of them seems to resemble to the biological cell. Luzzi (7) microcapsulated oil or dispersed solid particles with gelatin-gum arabic complex by using the complex coacervation process. Toyoda (8) also microcapsulated enzymes. These authors investigated permeability of these microcapsule membranes hardened with formaldehyde. The properties of the microcapsule membranes may be closely associated with the formation of coacervate droplets. In our previous studies (9, 10), we have investigated the complex coacervation in aqueous system on a pair of synthetic positive and negative polyelectrolytes suitably synthesized. Polyelectrolytes used were partly aminoacetalyzed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-AA), and partly sulfated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-S), with which conditions for complex coacervation to occur were discussed with charge density a, polymer

chain length r, and thermodynamic interaction parameters Z's. We pointed out that the entropy and enthalpy of mixing, and the electrostatic interaction should take into account to interpret the complex coacervation. With respect to natural polymers, for example for gelatin(pI = 5)-gelatin(pI = 9) system, Veis (11, 12) pointed out that the contribution by electrostatic interactions was negligibly small, so that the effect of thermodynamic interaction played an important role for complex coacervation. Also known are the systems in which the complex formation was conducted by the hydrogen bonding, not by ionic interaction, as suggested by Woodside (13) for gelatin-dextran system. In this work, we will investigate the formation of coacervate droplets in conjunction with the conditions for complex coacervation to take place for systems containing PVA-AA and PVA-S.
Experimental
1. Polyelectrolytesamples
PVA-AAand PVA-Swere synthesizedby the methods
as reported in the previouspaper (1).The excessmicrosalt
in the reaction mixture was removed by dialysis against
pu~ewater, so as to obtain PVA-Sand PVA-AAin forms
of -SO4H and -NH2, respectively. The details of the
samples used for the experiments are shown in table 1.
2. Viscositymeasurements
The viscosity measurements were carried out at 25 °C using an Ubbelohde-type capillary viscometer.
The flowtime of pure water at 25 °C was 137.3sec. The
temperature was kept within _+0.02 °C.

3. Microscopy
A phase-contrast microscope manufactured by Nippon Kogaku Co. was used to observe the coacervate droplets.
4. Phase equilibria
As shown in elsewhere (10),a PVA-AAaqueous solu
tion was added to an aqueous solution containing PVA-S equivalent to PVA-AA. The total concentration Ct of polycation plus polyanion was adjusted by adding pure
water to the mixture. Depending on the charge density a and Ct, it took 10min to several hours for the coacer
vate phase to appear. In this experiment, volumes and concentration of both phases, the coacervate and equi
librium phases, were measured after overnight standing at 25 + 0.1 °C. The concentration of the coacervate phase
was obtained by substracting the amount of polymer in
the equilibrium phase from the total amohnt of polymer. Analogous measurements were carried out for systems
in which a microsalt NaBr was added. In such case, microsalt was assumed to distribute uniformly in both coacervate and equilibrium phases.
Results and discussion
In fig. 1, the viscosity numbers of PVA-S (I), PVA-AA(I), and an equivalent mixture of both samples in water at 25 °C are plotted against the concentration c (g/dl). The viscosity numbers of PVA-S (I) and of PVA-AA(I) markedly increase with decreasing concentration, which exhibits a feature characteristic of polyelectrolytes. Previously one (14) of the authors has investigated the viscosity numbers ofpolyvinyl alcohol acetalyzed partly with glyoxylic acid, having the same degree of polymerization but different amounts of ionizable residues, and pointed out that characteristic viscosity behavior for polyelectrolyres was observed with polymers carrying more than two ionic residues per chain. Curve A and B in fig. 1 are similar to those for polyvinyl alcohol acetalyzed with glyoxylic acid. Contrary,

the curve C for the equivalent mixture, diluted by adding pure water subsequently, is quite different. The curve C suggests that a neutral polymer salt is formed by an electrostatic interaction between PVA-S(I) and PVA-AA(I). The dimension of the polymer salt, perhaps a complex consisting of some polyelectrolyte molecules rather than a pairing aggregate of a polycation and a polyanion (15), was incidentally almost the same in order as the chain dimension of polyvinyl alcohol having the degree of polymerization 850. Formation of polymer salt may reduce the extension of each polyelectrolyte chain, but increase the number of molecules in a complex. Phase-contrast micrographs of an equivalent mixture of PVA-S(III) and PVA-AA(II) in an aqueous system at a 2 % polymer concentration are shown in fig. 2. Figs. 2a and 2b are the photographs taken without and with cover glass, respectively. Coacervation droplets in fig. 2a are perfectly spherical, while droplets in fig. 2b are deformed and have clearer shapes. All the following photographs were taken with cover glass. When two droplets approached, they passed by each other deforming a shape as a amoeba. However, they rarely coalesced. Fig. 2c shows the formation of coalescence in a 1% aqueous solution of equivalent PVA-S(III)PVA-AA(II).

Fig. 3a is a micrograph of the coacervate (lower) phase after macroscopic phase separation took place for a system containing 2~ PVA-S(III)-PVA-AA(II) complex. The photograph of the equilibrium (upper) phase associated with fig. 3a is shown in fig. 3 b. The upper phase was transparent in appearance and it contained very small numbers of coacervate droplets, while the lower phase was turbid. In a long period, e.g., a month, it became clearer maybe owing to the coalescence of droplets. Also observed was that larger droplets were formed with increasing charge density of both polycation and polyanion, and that addition of a microsalt reduced the size of the droplets. Fig. 4 shows the relation between the concentration Cc of the coacervate phase and that Ce of the equilibrium phase against the total concentration Ct for the system of PVA-S(I)-PVA-AA(I) in water at 25 °C. The result on the system of PVA-S(II)-PVA-AA(II) is illustrated as a reference to show a remarkable effect of the charge density on the complex coacervation. As is obvious from the figure, Cc markedly increases with increasing dilution. Bungenber 9 de Jong (16) observed with gelatin-gum arabic system that the coacervate droplets were formed even from an extremely dilute solution, i.e., Ct = 0.001 ~o and its Cc amounted to several tens percent. Such behavior also can be expected with the system of PVA-S-PVA-AA. For PVA-S(I)-PVA-AA(I) system, complex coacervation was suppressed in the concentration range above 12.2 mg/ml, as shown in fig. 4. This behavior was named as self-suppression by Veis (12) for gelatin-gelatin system. For the droplets formation, polyelectrolyte molecules are necessary to have larger electrostatic potential than a certain value. Because the concentration at the critical point shifts to higher concentration side with increasing charge density, as expected from the experimental data designated by • in fig: 4. In fig. 5, the concentration Cc of the coacervate phase, the volume V~of the coacervate phase per total volume V of 10 ml, and the polymer fraction f in coacervate phase are respectively plotted against the total concentration Ct. Relation among these quantities is given by f = C~ V~/Ct V, in which V= 10 ml. As is obvious from fig. 5, the phase separation takes place below C , = 12.2mg/ml, and V~ and f have maxima at C, = 8.5 and Ct = 3.5 mg/ml, respectively. At Ct = 12.0mg/ml, relatively small

droplets were observed. At C~ = 8.5 and 3.5 mg/ ml, the sizes of droplets were not uniform but the average sizes were not different in both concentrations. It seems that, in the concentration range in which V~ increases with increasing Ct, the sizes of droplets are not largely affected by C,. Fig. 5 suggests that (a) the number of droplets is maximum at Ct = 8.5 mg/ml, (b) the yield of droplets is maximum at Ct = 3.5 mg/ml, and (c) the polymer concentration in droplets is exponentially increased with decreasing Ct. Polyelectrolyte chains in aqueous solution are extended with decreasing polymer concentration on account of their electrostatic potentials.

Accordingly, the more dilute are the solutions of polycation and polyanion, the more numbers of polymer chains participate to form a coacerrate droplet, and thus contribute to make the polymer concentration rise in a droplet. Effects of added NaBr to suppress the complex coacervation are shown in fig. 6 for PVA-S(II)-PVA-AA(II) system. The value of Ct was about 28.6 mg/ml. As is obvious from the figure, complex coacervation is markedly suppressed by the addition of more than an equivalent amount of NaBr, 14.3 raM. Our experimental result may be compared with that for gelatin-gum arabic system reported by Voorn (13), for which were obtained V~= 1.57 ml and f = 28 at C, = 26.3 mg/ml and 8.3 m M KC1. Our system is characterized by that Vc is very large though f is very small.
Summary
The complex coacervation, defined as a liquid-liquid phase separation in the system of polycation-polyanionsolvent with or without added microsalt, was investigated with polyelectrolytes prepared from polyvinyl alcohol by partial esterification. In particular, conditions for the formation of coacervate droplets were discussed as functions of charge density and polymer concentration.
