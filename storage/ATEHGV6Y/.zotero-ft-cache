ABSTRACT: The implementation of a reliable, rapid, inexpensive, and simple method for whole-proteome identification would greatly benefit cell biology research and clinical medicine. Proteins are currently identified by cleaving them with proteases, detecting the polypeptide fragments with mass spectrometry, and mapping the latter to sequences in genomic/proteomic databases. Here, we demonstrate that the polypeptide fragments can instead be detected and classified at the single-molecule limit using a nanometer-scale pore formed by the protein aerolysin. Specifically, three different water-soluble proteins treated with the same protease, trypsin, produce different polypeptide fragments defined by the degree by which the latter reduce the nanopore’s ionic current. The fragments identified with the aerolysin nanopore are consistent with the predicted fragments that trypsin could produce.

INTRODUCTION
Determining the identity of individual protein species in complex mixtures from biological samples is a key problem in cell biology and clinical diagnostics. If this measurement capability could be made simple, robust, automated, and low cost, it could provide research scientists with a tool to measure
proteins in tissues and cells1 and likely would markedly enhance medical testing at point-of-care facilities (i.e., emergency rooms and doctors’ offices). Proteomics analysis
techniques, such as 2-D electrophoresis,2 Edman degradation,3
immunoassays,4 and mass spectrometry,5,6 are not yet amenable for either application. In addition, unlike PCR for DNA, there is presently no high-throughput methodology for
producing many copies of a single protein,7 which limits the concentration at which a given protein can be detected. In this context, single-molecule proteomics approaches such as
fluorosequencing,8 Förster resonance energy transfer,9 modi
fied spectrometer,10 tunneling current,11,12 and nanopores have
shown some promise.13,14 Although these methods can detect single molecules, they each have a limit of detection, which needs to be determined experimentally. Single nanometer-scale pores have been used to detect, identify, and physically characterize individual molecules (e.g.,
ions,15,16 single-stranded oligonucleotides,17 natively folded
proteins,18 synthetic polymers,19−21 sugar molecules,22,23
unfolded proteins,24−26 synthetic polypeptides,27 metallo
nanoparticles,28 and oxidative DNA damage29) without the use of labels. The method is relatively simple; that is, the entry of a single molecule into the pore reduces the flow of ions that
otherwise occurs freely through a fully open pore.17,30 However, it is not merely a nanoscale version of the Coulter
counter method.31 For the technique to work, two issues had
to be resolved: stop the nanopores from gating15,32 and have the molecules transport through the pore much more slowly
than the diffusion limit.33−35 The most popular application of nanopore-based single-molecule characterization is DNA sequencing, which changed the genomics landscape by offering extreme portability, very long reads, and the identification of
either the nucleotides themselves17,36,37 or tagged surrogates
(which potentially provides far fewer base call errors).38,39 The proteomics paradigm will be positively impacted if a nanopore-based sequencing approach is applied to protein analysis. However, the latter faces many well-known challenges related to protein complexities including the heterogeneity and relatively great number of amino acid side chain residues, posttranslational modifications, and the more problematic control
of unfolded protein transport through the nanopore.13,40−42 Unlike DNA, which has one phosphate in the polymer backbone per base, proteins are not uniformly charged, which makes the direction of polypeptide movement more random, which of course would confound any effort to sequence proteins. To address these challenges, several nanopore approaches have been pursued including transposing the DNA strand
method,40−44 applying a DNA digestion sequencing techni

que45 to proteins, “sizing” of different amino acids linked to a peptide fragment,27 or determining the size of single peptides.46 These approaches were used to characterize polypeptide chains with single amino acid resolution,27,40,46−50 detect and identify specific amino acids,45,51,52 and detect subtle chemical modifications27,40,53−55 or post-translational modifications,56−58 but have not been able to read an entire protein’s sequence. As protein sequencing remains an unmet challenge, protein identification by single-molecule fingerprinting methods are being considered.13 These techniques involve comparing a measured protein signal to a database of known protein signatures. Although this requires the use of large databases and provides a less detailed picture of protein composition than the sequencing approach, it is of great interest,
particularly because of its relative technical simplicity compared to sequencing. Several computational studies showed the feasibility for whole-proteome identification with high confidence through single-molecule fingerprinting (based on either nanopore measurements,59,60 fluorosequencing,61 or Förster resonance energy transfer62) coupled with deep learning artificial intelligence strategies. For instance, it has been predicted, when using solid-state nanopores coupled to labeled analytes, that more than 95% of the proteins in the human proteome can be identified by labeling the same set of three amino acid residues.59 More recently, it was demonstrated computationally that 97.9% of the proteins in the human proteome can be identified using biological nanopores when detecting fragments from enzymatic degradation of unlabeled proteins.60 One study with a solid-state nanopore suggests that physical theory

(rotational dynamics) might prove useful to identify proteins, at the single-molecule level, when they are bound to a site
inside the pore.63 Here, we demonstrate a technique for protein fingerprinting at the single-molecule level, by combining nanopore technology with an approach analogous to the existing standard mass-spectrometry-based protein identification method, where copies of the protein to be identified are cleaved into peptide fragments, the products are subsequently analyzed, and the results are compared to a signal database of known proteins to identify the target protein. Some of our initial findings were
reported elsewhere,64 and Maglia’s group showed a similar
proof-of-concept using the Frac nanopore65 at the time of the
present work’s submission.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Nanopore-Based Protein Fingerprinting Approach. Our goal is to identify proteins by detecting their enzymatically cleaved fragments using a nanopore. We deemed this feasible because it was shown that a single biological nanopore can
detect the enzymatic digestion of biopolymers in the bulk. Specifically, the Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin channel was used to detect, in real time, the RNase A-induced cleavage of poly(U) oligonucleotides into ever smaller random length polymers, and the negative control with poly(A) homopolymers, which are not substrates for RNase A, worked as
predicted (i.e., no poly(A) cleavage products were detected).17 To test the possibility that nanopores could also detect enzyme-produced protein fragments, we first used the αhemolysin nanopore, trypsin, and a short polypeptide sequence (e.g., the first 40 N-terminus amino acid residues of the Bacillus
anthracis lethal factor protein66). At pH 5.5, trypsin should have produced five positive, three neutral, and three negative polypeptide fragments. The results demonstrated that the uncleaved polypeptide produced essentially no nanopore current blockades (data not shown). After adding trypsin, we observed three peaks in the mean normalized residual current histogram (Supplementary Figure 1), when the applied potential would electrophoretically drive net negatively charged molecules into the pore. Because the mean residence

times of synthetic polymers and short single-stranded DNA oligomers are much greater in the AeL pore than in the
channel formed by α-hemolysin,19,21,33 we used AeL to analyze the three target native proteins in this study. Figure 1a demonstrates that when a native protein of interest is first unfolded and then digested with trypsin, the resultant polypeptide fragments can readily be detected with an AeL nanopore. A typical ionic current recording segment, which illustrates the interaction of different peptide fragments with +100 mV applied voltage, is shown in Figure 1b. The measured quantities (the mean residual current Ib or its value relative to the mean open pore current Ib/IO and the fragment-induced blockade duration tb) are shown for a typical event. The corresponding scatter plot of tb as a function of Ib/IO and the histogram of the Ib/IO values are shown in Figure 1c and d, respectively. Both the scatter plot and histogram show eight well-separated peaks, which correspond to distinct fragment populations with easily discernible Ib/IO values. These populations correspond to the interaction of physically distinct, different peptide fragments from the enzymatic digestion of the target protein, with the AeL nanopore. Typical well-resolved events for each population are shown in the top panel. We show below that the identity of the target protein is defined by the number of polypeptide fragment populations and their mean Ib/IO values (⟨Ib/IO⟩). To critically evaluate the potential use of AeL nanopores for discriminating between different proteins, we analyzed three target proteins with roughly similar molecular masses,
myoglobin (16.9 kg mol−1), lysozyme (14 kg mol−1), and
cytochrome c (12 kg mol−1), which were each denatured and then subjected individually to proteolysis by the same enzyme, trypsin. The corresponding tb versus Ib/IO scatter plot and Ib/
IO histogram for each protein exhibit well-defined populations
of specific ⟨Ib/IO⟩ values, which correspond to different types
of detectable polypeptide fragments (Figure 2a−c, respectively). The number of polypeptide fragment populations and their respective ⟨Ib/IO⟩ values are shown in Figure 2d for each of these native target proteins. The results clearly show that these measurements constitute a sufficient criterion to discriminate between the native proteins. The reproducibility of the approach was assessed with three independent nanopores for each native protein. The corresponding Ib/IO histograms are shown for myoglobin (Figure 3) and cytochrome c and lysozyme (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3, respectively). The number of peptide fragment populations and their ⟨Ib/IO⟩ values were highly reproducible for each target protein. While the number and positions of the ⟨Ib/IO⟩ populations
are clear criteria for nanopore-based fingerprinting of proteins, it is possible that, considering the estimated number (>2 ×
104) of different proteins in the human proteome,67 several protein profiles based only on this measurement might overlap. To address this issue, additional current blockade event statistical properties, as well as different experimental conditions (see the Conclusion section), could be explored to decipher ambiguous profiles. Among the blockade properties, one may consider for each Ib/IO population j the distribution of blockade durations (tb)j and the distribution of
residual current standard deviations (σb)j (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures 4, 5, and 6), which provide additional characteristic and reproducible information to refine the signature of each initial protein. As an illustration, Supple
mentary Table 2 shows the protein fingerprinting ID of the three proteins analyzed here.

Polypeptide Capture Mechanism. This capability clearly requires that a sufficient number of different types of polypeptide fragments enter the pore. To gain insight into the underlying physical mechanisms for polypeptide capture by the AeL nanopore, we compared the blockade frequency of myoglobin fragments with both polarities of the applied potential (Figure 5). For ΔV < 0, only a few peptide-induced current blockades per unit time are detected, in marked contrast to the results obtained with ΔV > 0. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with the other proteins (see Supplementary Figure 7). This strong asymmetry indicates a predominant role of voltage-dependent forces in polypeptide entry (for details see note 1 in the Supporting Information). For a given initial protein, we compared the measured blockade populations to the theoretical trypsin-induced peptide fragments (Figure 6). Indeed, theoretically, cleavage by trypsin should have produced 23, 24, and 23 polypeptide fragments for myoglobin, lysozyme, and cytochrome c, respectively. However, the AeL nanopore detected fewer (i.e., 8, 9, and 9) different fragments (Figure 6), based on the degree by which the polymers reduce the pore conductance with related blockade duration distributions. Two major forces that could overcome the geometric entropy barrier to polymer
capture by a nanopore68,69 are electrophoresis (e.g., for
oligonucleotide capture by the α-hemolysin nanopore17,70) and electroosmotic flow (EOF) (e.g., for capture of electrically
neutral cyclodextrins in the α-hemolysin and AeL pores71). A detailed analysis of the peptide fragment capture data reported
here is presented in the Supporting Information, but based on the applied voltage polarity, polypeptide net charge, and size detection threshold, the results suggest that EOF plays a significant role in peptide capture and transport in the AeL pore. EOF can allow polypeptide fragments with different net electrical charges toward the nanopore (even possibly against electrophoresis), thus increasing the potential number of fragments contributing to the signature of the initial protein. The details of polypeptide capture physics notwithstanding, it is clear that similar molecular mass proteins can be discriminated by the AeL nanopore even without detecting
all of the fragment types.

CONCLUSION
We demonstrated the ability of the Ael nanopore to discriminate between different native proteins based on the signals generated by trypsin-induced polypeptide fragments. While the three proteins studied here are similar in molecular mass, the method should work well without limitation of the size, conformation, and charge of the protein. Moreover, the present method is easier to implement, rapid, inexpensive, user-friendly, and label-free. It also avoids cumbersome sample preparations compared to conventional methods and most other single-molecule techniques. In addition, it can be quantitative, because the capture rates of the different polypeptides should be proportional to their concentrations. As is true with other fingerprinting methods, this method requires access to large databases. Nevertheless, our technique

could be immediately and easily be integrated into existing high-throughput nanopore platforms and could find immediate application for protein identification in the context of clinical applications and life sciences. In addition to using the above criteria (specific ⟨Ib/IO⟩ values, plus the residence time and blockade event standard deviation distributions) to discriminate between different proteins based on fragment-induced nanopore current blockade patterns, varying the experimental conditions, including applied potentials (to change part of the driving force for capturing the polypeptide fragments), electrolyte concentration (to alter electrostatic interactions of the polypeptides with the nanopore), different pH values (to change the net charge on the polypeptide fragments), temperature (to alter the nanostructures within the fragments), and/or different proteases (to cleave the proteins into different fragments), will likely provide additional discrimination capability. We are currently exploring those possibilities. Nevertheless, the ability of the AeL nanopore to discriminate between three different proteins with approximately the same molecular mass is clear.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Aerolysin Production. AeL is a pore-forming toxin from Aeromonas hydrophila produced as the precursor protein proaerolysin
(ProAeL), which forms soluble dimers.72,73 Recombinant wild-type ProAeL was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 using the pET22b-PA vector. ProAeL is produced after IPTG induction and localizes into
the bacteria periplasm. The periplasmic fraction containing soluble
ProAeL dimers was extracted using an osmotic shock.74 Because the recombinant protein is C-terminal His-tagged, ProAeL was further purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-Sepharose MiniSpin columns and elution was made by adding imidazole. The recombinant ProAeL purity (about 99%) was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining. The ProAeL concentration was estimated by optical absorbance at 280 nm. ProAeL was activated by trypsin digestion (5:3 ProAeL:trypsin mass ratio) and stored at 4 °C for up to one month.
Proteins, Enzymes, and Aqueous Buffers. His SpinTrap mini columns were purchased from GE Healthcare Life Science (Chicago, IL, USA), and IPTG (R0392) and HEPES buffer (BP310) from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Cytochrome c (C2506), lysozyme (L6876), myoglobin (M0630), guanidine hydrochloride (G4505), trypsin solution (T1426), imidazole (104716), potassium chloride (P5405), and decane (457116) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Dithiothreitol (DTT, 10708984001), diphytanoyl-phosphocholine (DPhPC, 850356P), and tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS, 28808.294) were purchased from Roche (Basel, Switzerland), Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA), and VWR (Radnor, PA, USA), respectively. Protein Digestion. Cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myoglobin (280 μM) were denatured with 3.6 M GdnHCl and reduced with 5 mM DTT for 45 min at 25 °C under 300 rpm stirring. The solution was subsequently diluted 5-fold with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5. Each protein was digested by trypsin in a 1:20 ratio (protein:trypsin, mass:mass) for 16 h at 37 °C under 300 rpm stirring. Trypsin cleavage was stopped by quenching the sample in ice. The fragmented proteins were analyzed with the nanopores the same day.

In Silico Modeling of Protein Digestion. In silico modeling of each protein’s fragmentation by trypsin was calculated using the free software expasy PeptideCutter (https://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/ peptide_cutter/peptidecutter.pl?I7CLV3). The codes of the analyzed proteins (myoglobin: P68082, lysozyme: P00698, cytochrome c: P00004) are available in a free Uniprot database (https://www. uniprot.org). For each protein, the number, sequence, number of amino acids, mass, and electrical charge of the peptide fragments are listed (Supplementary Table 1). Nanopore Recording. A vertical lipid bilayer setup (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) was used for all the experiments with AeL. The lipid bilayer was formed by painting and spontaneous thinning a film of DPhPC in decane (10 mg/mL) over a 150 μm diameter aperture separating the cis and trans compartments. The aqueous solutions on both sides of the membrane contained 1 mL of 4 M KCl and 25 mM HEPES at pH 7.5. Two Ag/AgCl electrodes were used to apply +100 mV across the membrane and measure the ionic current. The cis compartment is defined as the virtual ground. After forming the lipid bilayer, activated aerolysin was added to the cis compartment at ∼50 ng/mL final concentration. Once a single AeL nanopore formed, 100 μL of a fragmented protein sample (i.e., either myoglobin, lysozyme, or cytochrome c that had been treated with trypsin) was added to the cis compartment at a final protein concentration of 0.2 μM for myoglobin and 1 μM for lysozyme or cytochrome c (thus diluting the cis compartment to 3.6 M KCl).
Single-channel current recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in the whole-cell mode with a CV-203BU headstage. The signal was filtered using the internal 4-pole Bessel filter at a cutoff frequency of 10 kHz. The data were digitized at 100 kHz and current digital resolution of 30.5 fA/bit state, using a DigiData 1550B A/Dconverter (Molecular Devices) controlled by Clampex 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). The solution temperature was held at 22.0 ± 0.2 °C for all the experiments with a Peltier device controlled by a bipolar temperature controller (CL-100, Warner Instruments) coupled to a liquid cooling system (LCS-1, Warner Instruments). Single α-hemolysin channels were formed by adding that poreforming toxin to the cis side of DPhPC membranes on an Electronic BioSciences quartz nanocapillary (San Diego, CA, USA). The aqueous electrolyte solution contained 4 M KCl, and the ionic current was measured with an Electronic BioSciences patch clamp amplifier. The N-terminal fragment of B. anthracis lethal factor (with the following amino acid residues: AGGHGDVGMH VKEKEKNKDE NKRKDEERNK TQEEHLKEIM) was added to the cis solution. Because the original polypeptide was short, a denaturant was not added. Trypsin was subsequently added to the cis side, and the transient current blockades caused by protease-induced polypeptide fragments were detected by threshold discrimination with in-house software (e.g., ref 17), despite the fact that trypsin activity is reduced
at high ionic strength.75 The current blockade histogram plot

(Supplementary Figure 1) was created by computing the mean current for each event and calculating the ratio of those mean current values to the mean fully open nanopore current. Data Analysis. Data analysis for the AeL nanopore was performed using Igor Pro 6.12A software (WaveMetrics, OR, USA) with inhouse routines. The approach relies on a statistical analysis of the properties of the analyte-induced current blockades, involving at least
several hundreds (more typically thousands) of events.17 The detection of each individual current blockade in a nanopore current versus time recording is based on a single current-threshold (Th) method. A blockade event is detected when the current magnitude becomes smaller than Th, until it returns to a value greater than Th. The beginning of the blockade is defined as the first point of current increase after having monotonically decreased below Th, and its end as the last point of current decrease before monotonically increasing above Th. This defines the range of points used to compute the characteristic quantities of the blockade, such as blockade duration tb,
mean value Ib, and standard deviation σb of the residual current. Here,
Th = I0 − 5 σ0, where I0 and σ0 are respectively the mean value and
standard deviation of a Gaussian fit of the open-pore current distribution. Before detection of blockades, the nanopore current versus time trace is smoothed using a median filter, with a 13-point window. Histograms of relative mean residual current Ib/IO are constructed with a bin width of 0.005. Ib/IO values constitute the main criterion to discriminate populations of blockades induced by enzymatically produced polypeptide fragments from the target proteins. Ib/IO
population j is defined as the subset of blockades whose Ib/IO values
fall in the range ⟨Ib/I0⟩j ± 1.96σj, where ⟨Ib/IO⟩j and σj are the mean
value and standard deviation of a Gaussian fit of the distribution of Ib/ IO values in the corresponding histogram peak, respectively. This range includes 95% of the Gaussian distribution. The mean blockade duration ⟨tb⟩j is determined by fitting the distribution of ln[(tb)j] values with a single-exponential probability density model, where the maximum of the distribution occurs at ln[⟨tb⟩j]. The mean standard deviation of the residual current ⟨σb⟩j is
the mean value of a Gaussian fit of the distribution of (σb)j values. In
the case where the distribution of (σb)j presents different
subpopulations, each subpopulation is Gaussian-fitted and associated
with its own mean value.
