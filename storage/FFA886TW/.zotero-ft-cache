ABSTRACT: Nonbonded and torsional parameters for carboxylate esters, nitriles, and nitro compounds have been developed for the OPLS-AA force field. In addition, torsional parameters for alkanes have been updated. These parameters were fit to reproduce ab initio gas-phase structures and conformational energetics, experimental condensed-phase structural and thermodynamic properties, and experimental free energies of hydration. The computed densities, heats of vaporization, and heat capacities for fifteen liquids are in excellent agreement with experimental values. The new parameters permit accurate molecular modeling of compounds containing a wider variety of functional groups, which are common in organic molecules and drugs. c© 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

omputer simulations of organic and biomolecular systems most commonly represent the intra- and intermolecular energetics with classical force fields.1 To this end, the OPLS-AA (optimized potentials for liquid simulations allatom) force field has been developed, with emphasis on simultaneously obtaining accurate descriptions of gas-phase conformational energetics

PROPERTIES OF ESTERS, NITRILES, AND NITRO COMPOUNDS
OPLS united-atom (OPLS-UA) parameters were previously reported for acetonitrile and methyl acetate,9, 10 the coverage is broader with OPLS-AA, multiple nitriles and esters are treated here, and AA models are generally more accurate, including improved charge distributions and conformational energetics.2, 3
Computational Details
FORCE FIELD
The molecules are represented by atom-centered interaction sites. The nonbonded energy between two molecules is determined by Coulomb and Lennard-Jones terms between all intermolecular pairs of sites, i and j, separated by a distance rij [eq. (1)]. The A and C parameters in eq. (1) are a function of the Lennard-Jones parameters, σ and ε, where Aii = 4εiσ 12
i and Cii = 4εiσ 6
i , and standard
combining rules apply such that Aij = (AiiAjj)1/2 and Cij = (CiiCjj)1/2. The nonbonded energy term is also computed for all intramolecular interactions between sites separated by more than two bonds. The scaling factor fij is 1.0 except for intramolecular 1,4-interactions, where fij = 0.5. This permits use of the same charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for both the inter- and intramolecular nonbonded energies.3

For individual molecules, terms representing bond stretching, angle bending, and torsional energetics are also included [eq. (2)]. The bond stretching and angle bending energies are represented by harmonic terms [eqs. (3) and (4)], where many of the force constants K and the equilibrium positions, req and θeq, have been adopted from the AMBER all-atom force field.11, 12 The remaining parameters were chosen to reproduce vibrational frequencies from experimental data or HF/6-31G∗ calculations.

The torsional energy is described by the Fourier series in eq. (5), where the sum is over all dihedral angles i, φi is the value of the dihedral angle, and the Vs are the Fourier coefficients, which are fit to reproduce experimental conformational data or torsional energetics from HF/6-31G∗ calculations. The total potential energy for a liquid, Etot, is then Enb plus the sum of the Ebats for all molecules.
FITTING PROCEDURES
Initial guesses for the partial charges were obtained by fitting to electrostatic potential surfaces from HF/6-31G∗ calculations,13 and most LennardJones parameters were assigned standard values.3 The charges and some Lennard-Jones parameters were then fine tuned in an iterative fashion to yield acceptable conformational energetics and pure liquid properties. Specifically, the nonbonded parameters were optimized by consideration of the gasphase torsional energetics and Monte Carlo results usually for only one low member of each series, i.e., methyl acetate, nitroethane, and acetonitrile. The nonbonded parameters for the larger members of the series were assigned by analogy and to maintain charge neutrality. Thus, the computed properties for the higher liquids are predictive. Rotational energy profiles for esters, nitriles, and nitro compounds were obtained at the HF/631G∗//HF/6-31G∗ level.14 The ab initio energies and structures were input into the program fitpar,15 and the Fourier coefficients for the specified dihedral angles were fit to reproduce the energy profiles, as previously described.3 HF/6-31G∗ calculations usually yield correct trends in barrier heights for rotation about single bonds.16 Although the absolute magnitudes of barrier heights are not consistently reproduced, this method has proven to be a reasonable source for conformational data in the absence of experimental results.17 Torsional energy profiles for seven dihedral angles were fit for the series of esters, and their remaining torsional parameters were taken from those for aldehydes, ketones, and ethers.3 The torsional parameters common to all esters were fit to methyl acetate, and parameters for unique dihedrals for systems with larger alkyl substituents were fit to those compounds. A similar procedure was used for parameterization of the nitro compounds. There were no dihedrals to parameterize for nitriles, because dihedral angles are undefined in cases where three of the four atoms are linear. The torsional parameters describing rotation about the C2—C3 single bond in propionitrile were taken from the similar

GAS-PHASE AND PURE LIQUID SIMULATIONS
Monte Carlo (MC) statistical mechanics simulations were performed for a single monomer in the gas phase as well as for pure liquids. All MC and molecular mechanics calculations were performed with the BOSS program.19 The MC simulations used Metropolis sampling and periodic boundary conditions.20, 21 The pure liquid systems consisted of 267 monomers in a cubic cell with box sizes ranging from 29–38 Å on an edge. Equilibration periods extended for 4–6 million (M) configurations, and the thermodynamic properties were averaged for an additional 6–10 M configurations. These lengths were chosen to guarantee convergence of the properties (they fluctuate about mean values by the ends of the equilibration periods) and to yield small statistical uncertainties in their final values. The simulations were carried out in the isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble at 25◦C and 1 atm. The intermolecular interactions were spherically truncated at center-ofmass separations of 9–15 Å, which were somewhat less than half the length of an edge of the cubic cell. A correction was made to the total energy for the Lennard-Jones interactions neglected beyond the cutoff.21 All internal degrees of freedom were allowed to vary in the molecules. Attempts to change the volume of the system (volume moves) were made every 600 configurations for the pure liquids. The ranges for intramolecular and intermolecular movements were adjusted to give overall accep
tance rates of ca. 40% for new configurations. The uncertainties reported for the computed energies, volumes, and heat capacities (±1σ ) were calculated via the batch means procedure,20 with batch sizes of ca. 0.2 M configurations. All calculations were run on Silicon Graphics workstations or Pentium-based personal computers.
Results and Discussion
OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS
The OPLS-AA nonbonded parameters developed in this study are reported in Tables I–II. Previously reported parameters for benzonitrile are included in Table II.22 The bond-stretching and angle-bending parameters for nitriles and nitro compounds are shown in Table III; the corresponding parameters for esters were taken from Charifson et al.12 The optimized Fourier coefficients for esters, nitriles, nitro compounds, and alkanes are shown in Table IV.
GAS-PHASE STRUCTURES AND TORSIONAL ENERGETICS
Relative energies from the OPLS-AA and HF/631G∗ calculations are compared for rotations about various dihedrals in esters and nitro compounds in Tables V and VI. In addition, conformational results for alkanes determined with the previous OPLS-AA torsional parameters3 and with the new parameters are compared to the best available experimental or ab intitio values in Table VII. The small changes in the torsional parameters for alkanes have negligible effect on the computed properties of lower alkane

In addition, the relative energies for low-energy conformers are reproduced most accurately. Accurate representation of low-energy conformers is more crucial, because they are more highly populated. The correct prediction of the similar energies for the conformers at 90◦ and 150◦ for isopropyl acetate and for trans
and gauche 1-nitropropane are particularly notable (Table V).

teraction energies are not intended to be identical with the HF/6-31G∗ ones, because adjustments are needed for the accurate reproduction of heats of vaporization and free energies of hydration. Similarly, the hydrogen bond lengths from OPLS-AA calculations generally need to be ca. 0.2 Å shorter than HF/6-31G∗ values to obtain correct liquid densities. The three complexes of methyl acetate–water with the strongest intermolecular interactions (Fig. 4) are similar to those determined in previous studies that used the OPLS united-atom force field.10, 32 Interestingly, the HF/6-31G∗ and OPLS-AA results both predict that an isolated water molecule prefers to hydrogen bond on the alkoxy side of the ester’s carbonyl oxygen (lower right in Fig. 4).

to have the C—N· · ·O fragment linear is only 0.2 kcal/mol. Related to this, we do find that one must be careful with the choice of optimizers; for hydrogen-bonded complexes, nongradient methods often lead to the true minima more readily. In both cases, the OPLS-AA interaction energies are more favorable, as expected, than prior CBS-4 results of −3.7 and −4.3 kcal/mol for the complexes with nitromethane and acetonitrile, respectively.30
LIQUID PROPERTIES
Liquid densities and heats of vaporization are important measures of the size of the molecules and the strength of their interactions.21 The molecular volumes and densities determined from the MC simulations of the pure liquids are in good accord with the experimental data, as shown in Table IX, with an average difference of ca. 1.6%. The computed densities for esters tend to be slightly too high, while the opposite tendency is found for the nitro compounds and nitriles. The enthalpy of vaporization is calculated from eq. (6).3, 21 The energy of the molecule in
Hvap = E(g) − Etot(l)/N + RT (6)
the gas-phase, Eintra(g), was determined from an MC simulation of an isolated monomer. The total energy for the liquid, Etot(l), with N molecules in the periodic cell is the sum of the intramolecular and intermolecular terms computed from eqs. (1)–(5) during the MC simulation. As shown in Table X, the intramolecular energies for a molecule in the gas phase or in the pure liquid are nearly identical in all cases. The accord confirms the expected lack of significant condensed-phase effects on the conformational equilibria for these monofunctional molecules. The average difference for heats of vaporization calculated with the OPLS-AA force field vs. experimental values is 0.6, 0.3, and 0.2 kcal/mol for esters, nitro compounds, and nitriles. The largest deviation, 1.18 kcal/mol, is for isopropyl acetate. Although homologation of the acyl chain (i.e., methyl acetate → methyl propionate) is not problematic, elaboration of the alkoxy chain appears to cause overly favorable intermolecular interactions. Because the densities for esters are also high, an increase in the Lennard-Jones σ and/or decrease in ε for the carbon and its hydrogens attached to the alkoxy oxygen might be appropriate. However, we try to avoid such small adjustments of LennardJones parameters, for example, only two values of σ are used so far in OPLS-AA for hydrogens on saturated carbons, 2.50 and 2.42 Å.

The liquid’s heat capacity is determined by adding an intermolecular component, Cinter
p (l), to an ideal gas C◦p less R according to eq. (7).21 The intermolecular contribution is computed from the fluctuations in the total intermolecular energy during the course of the liquid simulation. C◦p was either taken from experimental data or computed from HF/631G∗ vibrational frequencies, which were scaled by a factor of 0.9.14 The results for the liquids
Cp(l) = Cinter
p (l) + C◦
p − R (7)
are listed in Table XI, along with the experimental values. The accord is good, particularly in view of the statistical uncertainties, ca. ±2 cal/mol-K, in the computed heat capacities, which are known to converge more slowly than the energies and densities.21
LIQUID STRUCTURE
Radial distribution functions (RDFs) reflect the probability of finding two atoms at a distance r and, thus, can provide insight into the presence of specific interactions in liquids. These functions were calculated between most unique pairs of heavy atoms, and results are presented for the parent
molecules for the three functional groups. In each case, the RDFs are similar to those obtained in previous computational studies for liquid acetonitrile,9, 41, 42 methyl acetate,10 and nitromethane.43 Figure 6 shows several RDFs for methyl acetate. Each peak is relatively broad and featureless, indicating the absence of pronounced structure in the pure liquid.10 Liquid nitromethane shows somewhat more structure with distinct first peaks for O—C and N—O contacts (Fig. 7). The former peak is suggestive of some C—H· · ·O hydrogen bonding.44 Figure 8 shows a snapshot of a representative Monte Carlo configuration for liquid nitromethane. The darkened molecules provide a typical example with a short C—H· · ·O distance of 2.2 Å, which is well within the normal H· · ·O hydrogen-bonding limit of 2.5 Å.21 The O—C distance of 3.3 Å and the N—C distance of 4.5 Å fall in the first peaks for their RDFs in Figure 7. For liquid acetonitrile (Fig. 9), the pronounced first peak for the N-methyl C (NZ–CT) RDF reflects a further increase in order and the existence of headto-tail chains in the liquid.9, 41, 42 Furthermore, the NZ–NZ the CZ–NZ RDFs show two distinct peaks,

which can be attributed to antiparallel arrangement of the chains (Fig. 10a).9, 42 The antiparallel dimer was optimized with the OPLS-AA force field; the NZ–NZ, CZ–NZ, and NZ–CT distances are 3.57, 3.20, and 3.30 Å , which coincide with the first peaks in the corresponding RDFs in Figure 9. Shorter NZCT distances can arise from the head-to-tail dimer (Fig. 10b). It also has optimal NZ–NZ and CZ–NZ separations of 5.80 and 4.63 Å, which fall in the centers of the second peaks for the corresponding RDFS (Fig. 9).
FREE ENERGIES OF HYDRATION
Calculations of the difference in free energies of hydration between two molecules A and B are based on the following thermodynamic cycle.
A(g)
GA
Ggas B(g)
GB
A(sol) Gsol B(sol)
The relative change in free energy, ( G(A → B)), is given by eq. (8), where the individual free energy changes, Ggas and Gsol, are calculated via the sta
tistical perturbation theory.45, 46
 G(A → B) = GB − GA = Gsol − Ggas (8)
Convergence of the free energy changes is enhanced by performing a series of simulations to mutate molecule A to B using a coupling parameter λ, which ranges from 0 for A to 1 for B. A mutation is run in the gas phase in order to determine Ggas, and another is performed in solution to yield Gsol. In this study, standard protocols8 were used to perturb methyl acetate to acetone, nitroethane to propanal, and acetonitrile to methane in the gas phase and in a periodic cube containing 507 TIP4P water molecules.31 As shown in Table XII, the computed relative free energies of hydration are in reasonable agreement with experimental data with an average error of 0.8 kcal/mol. Furthermore, to characterize the hydration of the solutes, RDFs, energy pair distributions, and snapshots from the simulations were analyzed for methyl acetate, nitroethane, and acetonitrile. The key results can be summarized as follows. As expected from Figures 4 and 5, each solute forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules, which are reflected in distinct first peaks in the RDFs between the oxygen atoms for the ester and ni

For acetonitrile, the solute–water energy pair distribution begins at −6.2 kcal/mol, and shows a weak minimum at −4.1 kcal/mol; integration to that point indicates 1.1 strong hydrogen bonds. However, integration to the first minima in the N–HW rdf at 2.5 Å or the N–OW RDF at 3.1 Å indicates that there are 2.1 water molecules in the hydrogen-bonding range.

Summary
In an important extension of the applicability of the OPLS-AA force field, parameters were derived for carboxylate esters, nitriles, and nitro compounds. These functional groups are commonplace in drug candidates, and the parameters are consequently needed, for example, in MC or molecular dynamics simulations of such functionalized molecules binding to proteins. The development and testing included consideration of gas-phase structures, interaction energies, and structures for complexes with a water molecule, and thermodynamic and structural properties of pure liquids and aqueous solutions. No substantial flaws are apparent, and the quality of the computed results is in the normal range for the OPLS-AA model.
