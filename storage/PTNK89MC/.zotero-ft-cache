I. Introduction
Surface segregation of implanted species, such as helium (He) and hydrogen isotopes, in plasma facing components (PFCs) in nuclear fusion reactors underlies the key mechanisms of surface morphological evolution and near-surface structural
evolution of these materials, as well as the retention and permeation of tritium [1]. Tungsten (W) is a promising PFC material because its thermomechanical properties make it very appealing for functioning in such extreme environments. Consequently, understanding the subsequent evolution of implanted helium atoms in the near-surface region of tungsten

Abstract
We report a hierarchical multi-scale modeling study of implanted helium segregation on surfaces of tungsten, considered as a plasma facing component in nuclear fusion reactors. We employ a hierarchy of atomic-scale simulations based on a reliable interatomic interaction potential, including molecular-statics simulations to understand the origin of helium surface segregation, targeted molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of near-surface cluster reactions, and large-scale MD simulations of implanted helium evolution in plasma-exposed tungsten. We find that small, mobile Hen (1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7) clusters in the near-surface region are attracted to the surface due to an elastic interaction force that provides the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. This elastic interaction force induces drift fluxes of these mobile Hen clusters, which increase substantially as the migrating clusters approach the surface, facilitating helium segregation on the surface. Moreover, the clusters’ drift toward the surface enables cluster reactions, most importantly trap mutation, in the near-surface region at rates much higher than in the bulk material. These near-surface cluster dynamics have significant effects on the surface morphology, near-surface defect structures, and the amount of helium retained in the material upon plasma exposure. We integrate the findings of such atomic-scale simulations into a properly parameterized and validated spatially dependent, continuumscale reaction-diffusion cluster dynamics model, capable of predicting implanted helium evolution, surface segregation, and its near-surface effects in tungsten. This cluster-dynamics model sets the stage for development of fully atomistically informed coarse-grained models for computationally efficient simulation predictions of helium surface segregation, as well as helium retention and surface morphological evolution, toward optimal design of plasma facing components.

is required for the optimal design of PFCs to successfully sustain the extreme conditions under which they are expected to operate. It is well known that, in linear plasma devices as well as tokamak plasmas, implanted He atoms have significant impact on the PFC surface structure and morphology, causing formation of microscopic features known as ‘fuzz’ or ‘coral’ [2–8]. The dynamics of helium species in the PFC near-surface region mediates the formation of such complex surface morphologies; however, our understanding of the fuzz formation mechanism is very limited. In tungsten, aggregation of the mobile implanted interstitial He atoms leads to formation of helium clusters, Hen, of different sizes n [9–14]. The smaller of these helium clusters, with up to seven He atoms (n ⩽ 7), also are mobile; the mobility of these clusters mediates their migration to the tungsten surface facilitating helium surface segregation [15]. As they approach the surface, these segregating small clusters may undergo a number of reactions that impact significantly the surface morphology and the near-surface structure and chemical composition [16, 17]. Computationally efficient quantitative prediction of PFC near-surface structural evolution and surface morphological evolution requires a fundamental understanding and detailed modeling of helium transport and surface segregation in conjunction with the reaction dynamics enabled as helium segregates on the material surface. Toward this end, hierarchical multi-scale modeling of cluster formation and dynamics near PFC material surfaces is called to play a catalytic role. Using a hierarchy of atomicscale simulations, from targeted molecular-statics (MS) simulations to understand the origin of helium surface segregation in tungsten [15] and molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of near-surface cluster reactions [16, 17] to large-scale MD simulations of implanted helium evolution in plasma-exposed tungsten [1, 18], we have started to explore the effects of nearsurface helium cluster dynamics on the surface morphology, near-surface structure and defect types, and the amount and form of helium retained in the material upon plasma exposure. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate, systematize, and integrate the findings of such atomic-scale simulations toward the development, parameterization, and validation of a fully atomistically informed coarse-grained modeling and simulation framework capable of predicting implanted helium evolution, surface segregation, and its near-surface effects in tungsten. The coarse graining conducted in this study is along the lines of earlier cluster transport-reaction model developments [19–22], but far better integrated by incorporation into the coarse-grained description of the physics of helium surface segregation and the near-surface reaction dynamics. The rest of this article is structured as follows. The simulation methods employed in our study and their integration to model efficiently helium surface segregation and helium evolution in plasma-exposed tungsten are outlined in section II. The surface segregation of helium and helium-carrying species consisting of small mobile helium (Hen, 1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7) clusters in tungsten is analyzed in detail in section III together with its effects of helium cluster reactions in the near-surface region. Large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations of implanted helium evolution, clustering and surface segregation in
tungsten are presented in section IV, and the simulation results are explained on the basis of the analysis of section III. In section V, a continuum-mechanical cluster (transport-reaction) dynamics model is developed, parameterized according to the findings of section III, and implemented computationally in direct, self-consistent, coarse-grained cluster dynamics simulations; the model is validated by comparison of the simulation results with those of the molecular-dynamics simulations of section IV and sets the stage for computationally efficient simulations of helium surface segregation, clustering, and evolution in plasma facing components of nuclear fusion reactors. Finally, the most important conclusions of this study are summarized in section VI.
II. Simulation methods
Our analysis of helium segregation on surfaces of plasmaexposed tungsten follows a hierarchical, multi-scale computational approach, which aims at (i) probing the interactions of helium-carrying species in tungsten (small mobile helium clusters) with tungsten surfaces that underlie surface segregation and activate important kinetic phenomena in the near-surface regions, as well as characterizing these kinetic processes; (ii) exploring directly the dynamics of helium segregation on surfaces and obtaining a fundamental understanding of this dynamics on the basis of the above mentioned interactions and cluster kinetic processes; and (iii) developing, parameterizing, and implementing computationally a continuum-scale model of helium cluster dynamics in the near-surface tungsten region capable of predicting the helium evolution in the material and determining the amount of helium retained in the tungsten. This approach bridges atomic-scale analysis of helium cluster-surface interactions and evolution of a helium population implanted in tungsten with continuum-scale modeling and simulation of cluster transport and reactions in the near-surface tungsten region. Within this hierarchical computational framework, our simulation methodology integrates molecular-statics (MS) computations of helium cluster energetics near tungsten surfaces with targeted molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of cluster transport and reactions in the near-surface region, large-spatial-scale MD simulations of implanted helium aggregation and surface segregation, and continuum-scale self-consistent dynamical simulations of helium species (cluster) transport and reaction dynamics near free surfaces in tungsten. Our atomistic simulations, MS and MD, and related analysis were carried out using the open-source program LAMMPS [23]. Our MS simulations and our targeted MD simulations for analysis of near-surface cluster dynamics are detailed in section III. Our large-scale MD simulations of implanted helium evolution are described and analyzed in section IV. Our continuum-scale cluster dynamics models include both diffusive and convective (drift) transport for all mobile helium clusters coupled with nonlinear cluster reaction kinetics. The boundary-value problems (BVPs) for the cluster concentration fields, consisting of the corresponding coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) subject to the proper boundary conditions, are solved numerically

by implementing a centered finite-difference scheme that is described in more detail in section V, and in [19–22]. The parameterization of the continuum model is based fully on our atomic-scale simulations and the continuum-scale simulation predictions are compared systematically with the findings of our large-scale MD simulations for helium distribution in the near-surface region and helium retention in the material under certain implantation conditions in section V. In our MS and MD simulations, the interactions between W atoms were described according to the potential developed by Finnis and Sinclair [24], with a formalism similar to that of the embedded atom method, as modified initially by Ackland and Thetford [25] and more recently by Juslin and Wirth [26]. We have adopted the description of W-He pair-wise interactions according to the pair potential of Juslin and Wirth [26] and of He-He interactions according to the pair potential developed by Beck [27, 28] as modified at short distances by Morishita and co-workers [29]. Simulations based on these interatomic interaction potentials have reproduced accurately results for the formation energies and ground-state configurations of He point defects and self-interstitial atoms in W obtained by firstprinciples density functional theory (DFT) calculations [26]. The binding energies of small He-vacancy clusters predicted by these potentials are in excellent qualitative agreement with the DFT results; however, the potentials overestimate slightly but systematically vacancy binding energies [26]. In previous computational studies, helium implantation effects on tungsten surface evolution were explored in MD simulations based on these interatomic potentials [12–14, 30]. In general, the interatomic potentials employed in this study are considered to be very reliable for analysis of the energetics and dynamics of small mobile helium clusters in tungsten.
III. Analysis of cluster-surface interactions and their effects on cluster transport and surface segregation
A helium cluster in the tungsten matrix constitutes a center of dilatation that induces atomic displacements in the surrounding W atoms. This is evident in figure 1(a), which shows a relaxed atomic configuration of a He4 cluster near the W(1 1 1) surface, depicting an atomic displacement field directed outwards from the cluster center. This atomic displacement field interacts with that induced by the free surface, exerting an interaction force field on the cluster. This interaction field can be expressed elegantly using elasticity theory, where the cluster is considered as an elastic inclusion into the tungsten matrix, represented as a continuous elastic body, in the vicinity of the areal defect provided by the free surface, as shown in figure 1(b). This elastic inclusion analysis stems from Eshelby’s inclusion theory and has been implemented for inclusion-surface interactions in a continuous elastic medium [31–33] and for constituent species-surface interactions in spherical nanoparticles of compound semiconductors [34–36]. Following this description for helium clusters, Hen of size n (i.e. consisting of n He atoms), near tungsten surfaces leads to an expression for

where the minus sign implies an attractive interaction, i.e. that the surface acts as a sink for the helium cluster and As,n is the sink strength of the surface in attracting the cluster of size n. The term ‘sink strength’ that we use for the quantity As,n from here on refers, rigorously speaking, to the strength of the elastic driving force that drives He segregation to the surface; for clarification, we mention that, even in the absence of such a driving force, a sink strength for He segregation can still be assigned to the surface from the steady-state distribution (profile) of He in the near-surface region of the material through a distribution coefficient that expresses the ratio of the He concentration at the surface over that in the bulk. As,n is a function of the cluster size and the surface crystallographic orientation and depends on the thermodynamic state of the material that determines the material’s elastic moduli; these elastic properties are assumed to be weak functions of temperature over a temperature range well below the matrix material’s melting temperature. The gradient of the elastic interaction of equation (1) gives the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation of the cluster as

To avoid a singularity on the surface plane as |z| → 0, a surface thickness scale d0 can be introduced and |z|-d0 can be used instead of |z| in equation (1) [15]. This elastic interaction force is responsible for inducing a drift flux in the cluster transport near the free surface, with the corresponding drift velocity, ( )

As a result, this total flux affects the overall cluster balance (in the dilute limit)

through the divergence of the total flux that now includes the drift contribution from equation (4), where Rv,n is the homogeneous source/sink term for cluster production or consumption due to cluster reactions. We analyzed the interactions of small mobile Hen clusters (1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7) in tungsten with tungsten surfaces of low-Millerindex crystallographic orientation based on systematic MS simulations to derive the corresponding interaction energies as a function of cluster distance from the surface. Here, we focus on the interactions of these clusters with the W(2 1 1) surface; analysis of such cluster-surface interactions with the W(1 0 0), W(1 1 0), and W(1 1 1) surfaces were presented in [15]. In the MS simulations, each Hen cluster was inserted randomly with its center of mass located at a certain distance d = |z| from the surface with z = 0 marking the location of the surface plane. Then, the structure of this cluster configuration was relaxed by conjugate-gradient energy minimization with respect to the atomic coordinates (of He and W atoms) and the energy of the relaxed structure was obtained as a function of d with the distance d ranging up to 3.5 nm from the surface plane. Slab supercell models were employed in the MS simulations containing approximately 16 000W atoms. At each distance d, numerous initial cluster configurations were used for this local energy minimization procedure. Within this manifold of local energy minima, the lowest energy level computed was then assigned as the energy of the relaxed atomic configuration, ()

n (d ) profile for each cluster Hen, 1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7, and complete the derivation of its interaction with a tungsten surface of given crystallographic orientation. This corresponds to several hundred MS computations of local energy minimization, on average, with the actual number of MS runs increasing with increasing cluster size, for determining the
ground-state configuration at each cluster size for a certain distance d below the surface plane for a given surface orientation. Such an exhaustive approach, based on such a high number of initial configurations for local energy minimization at each point of the interaction energy profile for each cluster size and surface orientation combination considered, guarantees that cluster configurational space and the underlying energy landscapes are sampled very efficiently, which is reflected in the smoothness of the computed potential energy profiles for the cluster-surface interactions examined.

decayed to zero for a depth of 3.5 nm from the surface plane, which is the longest distance from the surface considered in our MS computations. We also observe that the elastic potential well becomes deep, i.e. the cluster-surface interaction becomes stronger as the cluster approaches the surface (with decreasing d ). In the surface region, this potential well also becomes much steeper, i.e. the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation increases dramatically. The results of figure 2 show that the fitting of the MS results according to the expression of equation (1) is excellent, implying that the elastic inclusion theory of equation (1) provides an excellent description of the MS results for Hen cluster-surface interactions for the clusters under consideration. This is actually the case for the interactions of all the small mobile Hen, 1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7, clusters with the W(2 1 1)
surface, which also is consistent with our findings for such Hen cluster-surface interactions with the W(1 0 0), W(1 1 0), and W(1 1 1) surfaces that was demonstrated in [15]. In this fitting procedure, for each cluster and surface orientation, the sink strength As,n is the only fitting parameter with the characteristic length d0 being fixed for each surface orientation examined. The results for As,n(n) for W(2 1 1) are shown in figure 3 and indicate that, consistently with the other three low-Millerindex surface orientations [15], As,n is a reasonably smooth and, generally, monotonically increasing function of cluster size n. The only anomaly to this smooth monotonic increase appears at n = 4, where the derivative dAs,n/dn decreases locally, which we attribute to the morphological changes undergone by the relaxed cluster configurations in the vicinity of n = 4 that corresponds to a compact tetrahedron, figure 2(b). The results of figure 3 for W(2 1 1), augmented by the results for the W(1 0 0), W(1 1 0), and W(1 1 1) surfaces, are summarized in table 1. These values for the sink strengths constitute direct input for parameterizing cluster drift transport in continuumscale models for macroscopic cluster dynamics simulations, which are discussed in section V.

A good quantitative metric for comparing the transport rates of a helium cluster of size n in the vicinity of a surface is the dimensionless Peclét number, Pes,n, that is commonly used in the analysis of transport phenomena involving both diffusive and convective (analogous to drift) fluxes [37]. The Peclét number expresses the rate of convection (drift) with respect to the rate of Fickian diffusion; Pes,n  1 implies that convection (drift) dominates Fickian diffusion, while Fickian diffusion dominates for Pes,n  1 and the two modes of transport have comparable rates if Pes,n = O(1). For Hen cluster transport near W surfaces, Pes,n can be defined as

Using equation (8), h = 2.5 nm, a temperature T = 933 K, and the results of table 1 for the sink strengths yields for nearsurface cluster transport the Peclét numbers of table 2 for all 7 clusters and 4 surface orientations examined in this study. The results of table 2 indicate that, in all cases, Pes,n  1. The smallest Pes,n values computed are of O(102) for the smallest clusters near W(1 1 0). In most cases Pes,n = O(104) or higher, with Pes,n = O(106) for the larger of these clusters near W(1 1 1) and W(2 1 1). These results imply that, in all cases examined, drift due to the driving force for surface segregation dominates helium cluster transport near tungsten surfaces compared to Fickian diffusion. A clear qualitative picture of helium surface segregation in plasma-exposed tungsten emerges from the above analysis: small, mobile Hen (1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7) clusters in the near-surface
region are attracted to the surface due to an elastic interaction force, equation (2), that constitutes the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation in addition to the concentration gradient due to the implanted helium atoms at some depth below the surface plane. The elastic interaction force induces drift fluxes of helium (in the form of these mobile Hen clusters), while the concentration gradient induces Fickian diffusive fluxes; both types of flux are directed toward the surface, contribute to the overall flux Jn of each cluster species, and drive helium surface segregation. As the migrating clusters approach the surface, the drift fluxes increase substantially, dominate the cluster transport fully, and facilitate the helium segregation on the surface. Interestingly, within the transport framework of equations (4) and (5), these drift and diffusive fluxes are distinct from the cluster reaction rates, Rv,n, while both transport and reaction rates contribute in a strongly coupled manner to the evolution and distribution of helium in the material. This coupling would be even stronger if surface segregation affected the rates of the Hen cluster reactions. This is, indeed, the case. We have investigated in detail these cluster reactions [16, 17] and found that the clusters’ drift toward the surface enables cluster reactions in the nearsurface region at rates much higher than those of the corresponding reactions in the bulk material (away from the surface). Specifically, we conducted a systematic MD simulation study of cluster dynamics for all the mobile Hen clusters in tungsten near W(1 0 0), W(1 1 0), W(1 1 1), and W(2 1 1) surfaces. For each cluster examined (1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7) and each surface orientation, several hundred trajectories were generated, each of which was a few-ns-long (5 to 10 ns depending on cluster size and surface orientation), at T = 1000–1200 K, in supercells containing N ⩾ 4000W atoms (different N were used for different surface orientations). The surface was treated as a free boundary, while periodic boundary conditions were applied in the lateral directions of the simulation cell. In each trajectory, the small helium cluster was placed initially at a distance of ~10–20 atomic layers from the surface (practically the same distance from the surface plane at each surface orientation) such that the cluster feels the attractive elastic interaction with the surface; the initial configurations corresponded to MS-relaxed structures (local energy minima) and the MD trajectories were initialized randomly. Much longer (~100 ns) MD trajectories for all classes of simulation outcomes confirmed the stability of the resulting configurations. This analysis identified all the types of reactions undergone by the clusters in the near-surface region and determined the corresponding reaction probabilities for each cluster and surface orientation examined [16, 17]; the outcomes of this analysis are used as input to the continuum-scale cluster dynamics simulations discussed in section V. Energy landscapes along optimal reaction pathways for the cluster reactions identified in the MD trajectories were constructed using the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [38, 39] as implemented within LAMMPS. The cluster kinetic processes identified by the MD analysis are trap mutation (TM), cluster partial dissociation (PD) following TM, and helium desorption from the surface [16, 17]. For n > 1, He desorption is caused by cluster dissociation.

TM leads to the formation of one or more (k ⩾ 1) W vacancies in lattice planes near the surface plane together with an equal number (k) of tungsten surface adatoms. The Hen cluster becomes attached to the generated vacancies, forming an immobile sub-surface Hen-vacancy complex. In the bulk material, TM reactions produce Frenkel pairs corresponding to equal numbers of vacancies and self-interstitial W atoms instead of tungsten adatoms; such TM reactions, involving Frenkel pair formation in the bulk metal, are typically characterized by high activation energy barriers. The near-surface TM reaction can be expressed as
kW +→ He He − V + kW,

where V and Ws denote a lattice vacancy and a surface adatom, respectively. The sequential reaction of TM followed by PD is expressed as

with m < n and He(g) denoting a He atom that desorbs from the tungsten surface to the gas phase. For m = 1 and k = 1, Hem-Vk corresponds to a substitutional He atom. For m = 0, Reaction (10) corresponds to W + Hen → W + n He(g), i.e. complete dissociation of the cluster leading to desorption of all the helium in the cluster from the tungsten surface. Trap mutation is by far the most important of these reactions, i.e. the corresponding reaction probability renders it the dominant cluster reaction for most cluster sizes and surface orientations studied. Specifically, we found TM reactions to be dominant for all combinations of cluster sizes and surface orientation with the exception of the He4 and He5 clusters near the W(1 0 0) surface [17]; for these combinations, i.e. (n = 4, n = [1 0 0]) and (n = 5, n = [1 0 0]), cluster PD reactions are the dominant ones although, it is worth mentioning again, PD reactions always occur as steps in a sequential reaction process occurring subsequent to a TM reaction [16, 17]. The reason why TM reactions are the dominant kinetic processes in Hen cluster dynamics near W(1 1 0), W(1 1 1), and W(2 1 1) surfaces are the low activation energy barriers for TM reactions in conjunction with the high energy barriers for PD reactions near these surfaces. Specifically, for all the TM reactions identified as the dominant near-surface cluster kinetic processes, in all cases of cluster size and surface orientation examined, the corresponding computed barriers ranged from 0.05 eV to 0.50 eV with most of them within the range of 0.06–0.28 eV according to the interatomic interaction potentials employed in this study [16, 17]. We also found that there is a critical cluster size, nc = 4–5, for the formation of multiple (k > 1) W adatoms and vacancies in TM reactions [17], i.e. k = 1 for n < nc; nc = 4 near W(1 0 0), W(1 1 1), and W(2 1 1) and nc = 5 near W(1 1 0) with values of k up to 4 for a single TM reaction near W(1 0 0), W(1 1 1), and W(2 1 1) surfaces.
IV. Molecular-dynamics simulations of helium segregation on tungsten surfaces
For direct dynamical simulation of helium implantation and the resulting near-surface evolution in tungsten, we conducted
large-spatial-scale MD simulation studies of helium aggregation and surface segregation in a manner similar to the studies of [15] and [18]. In these simulations, helium is implanted directly below the surface according to a pre-determined depth distribution, which is different for each surface crystallographic orientation examined and depends strongly on the impinging ion energy. To derive this depth distribution, we conducted, prior to the large-scale MD simulations, a series of 20 000 direct implantation MD simulations of He impingement (atom bombardment) on the W surface for each surface orientation under consideration. For these implantation simulations, an adaptive time step (over the range from 10−4 to 0.5 fs, chosen so that no atom moved more than 0.02 Å in one time step) was used to simulate a kinetic energy of the impinging He atoms (at normal incidence) of 100 eV. It should be mentioned that the incident energy of 100 eV in our simulations was chosen as a representative energy for experimental validation, which also is within a range below the sputtering threshold where the kinetic energy of the impinging ions has a relatively minor effect on the subsequent sub-surface microstructural evolution due to diffusional transport. Prior to atom bombardment, the W atoms were brought to a temperature of 933 K using velocity rescaling followed by a short period of non-temperature-controlled dynamics. After equilibration, the depth of the He atoms impacted on the W surface was averaged over all 20 000 runs to produce the desired cumulative implantation depth distribution. The time required for achieving statistically identical depth distribution results from the above sampling procedure was found to be approximately 2 ps [18]. In the subsequent large-scale MD simulations of helium evolution (aggregation and surface segregation) in the nearsurface region of the material, the top boundary of the simulation supercell was treated as a free surface, while periodic boundary conditions were applied in the principal directions of the horizontal surface plane; the dimensions of the simulation supercell employed in this study were approximately 50 nm × 50 nm × 25 nm, with the exception of the W(1 1 1) simulation, where the supercell dimensions were approximately 50 nm × 50 nm × 21 nm. Consistent with the studies of section III, the surfaces examined were W(1 0 0), W(1 1 0), W(1 1 1), and W(2 1 1). The implanted He atoms were inserted every 10 ps at random horizontal locations and at depths sampled from the depth distribution characteristic of the surface’s orientation; this rate of insertion and simulation parameters correspond to a helium flux of 4.0 × 1025 m−2 s, neglecting reflected ions. Temperature control in these simulations was based on a Nosé–Hoover chain thermostat [40–42]. The implementation details of the helium insertion process and temperature control were consistent with those of [15] and [18]. Representative results from our large-scale MD simulations are shown in figure 4, where only He atoms and W adatoms are shown; W atoms below the initial surface have been removed. Specifically, figures 4(a)–(d) depict the distribution of He atoms beneath W(1 0 0), W(1 1 0), W(1 1 1), and W(2 1 1) surfaces, respectively, demonstrating helium aggregation (clustering) and surface segregation. The atomic configurations shown in figure 4 correspond to an insertion of

83 000 He atoms into each supercell, which corresponds to a simulation time of 830 ns and, excluding He atoms reflected on the surface and going back to the gas phase, a fluence of 3.3 × 1019 m−2. In all cases, the pronounced decoration of the tungsten surfaces by He atoms is direct evidence of surface segregation, as expected from the analysis of section III. It is also evident that the number of He atoms present in the configurations of figure 4 is different for different surface orientations due to the different He retention rates for each of the four surface orientations examined. Comparing the
He distributions for the different surface orientations reveals a larger population of He atoms in the near-surface region for W(1 1 1), figure 4(c), and W(2 1 1), figure 4(d), than for W(1 0 0), figure 4(a), and W(1 1 0), figure 4(b). These differences in the He distribution at different surface orientations are understood well from the MS and MD analyses of section III. First, as established in table 1, the W(1 1 1) and W(2 1 1) surfaces are stronger sinks for mobile Hen clusters than the W(1 0 0) and W(1 1 0) surfaces, resulting in more effective He surface segregation on the former two surfaces. The second reason for these differences in the qualitative features of the near-surface He distribution, also explained in section III and in [18], is that trap mutation reactions near W(1 1 1) and W(2 1 1) surfaces have lower activation energies than those near the W(1 0 0) surface, which are lower still than those near the W(1 1 0) surface. In brief, the He distributions observed in figure 4 correlate strongly with the sink strengths and the TM reaction rates for the corresponding surface orientations.
V. Cluster dynamics modeling of helium transport, clustering, and reactions as a function of surface orientation
A continuum-scale cluster-dynamics code, Xolotl, has been developed to efficiently integrate numerous coupled partial differential equations in the form of equation (5) for all species of interest, formulated as 1D drift-diffusion-reaction equations for interstitial helium clusters, as well as a large network of helium—vacancy clusters and small tungsten self-interstitial atom clusters. This code has been developed using a finite difference grid and approximation of spatial derivatives employing centered finite differences, with a uniform grid spacing beginning several nanometers below the surface, similar to the approach used in several recent publications [19–22]. In the interest of brevity, the detailed clusterdynamics formalism, spatial discretization, and optimization of the numerical integration scheme to limit memory requirements are not described in detail here, but are available in the aforementioned papers [19–22]; herein, we focus on specific numerical developments in Xolotl relevant to the surface segregation of helium and reactions involving helium in W. Because we are interested in the behavior of the clusters near the surface, we implemented a grid with a finer spacing close to the surface. This changed the centered finite difference scheme for (purely Fickian) cluster diffusion (i.e. contribution to accumulation of species Hen being proportional to the second-order spatial derivative of its concentration) in the following way

following the same notation as in equation (11) and As,n being the sink segregation strength obtained from MS simulations and listed in table 1. In addition, we have modified the continuum clusterdynamics model to incorporate the near-surface trap-mutation reactions of helium clusters observed in MD simulations, as described in section III. It should be mentioned that the information from the analysis of the MD simulations used as input in the implementation of the continuum cluster-dynamics model consists of directly computed reaction probabilities for each cluster size and surface orientation considered, such as those listed in the Tables of reaction probabilities reported in [16] and [17]. A simplified version was implemented where, for each cluster size, only the dominant reaction of the class of equation (9) is added at the corresponding depth [16, 17]. This depth distribution depends on the surface orientation, and this reaction is made the dominant one by setting its rate to 1000 times higher than that of the highest reaction rate in the
bulk involving any helium cluster. Furthermore, the desorption of He1 from the (1 1 1) and (2 1 1) surfaces and of He2 from the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) surfaces is non-negligible; in order to take this into account, the trap-mutation rate of these clusters should be adjusted so that all relevant reactions of these clusters deeper below the surface still happen with a specific proportion. Therefore, if the fractional probability of desorption is α, then the trap-mutation rate is taken to be
α α

where kleft is the sum of the reaction rates where the helium cluster participates as a reactant (either combining with another cluster to create a new one, or dissociating). Figure 5 demonstrates the results of our continuum-scale cluster-dynamics model as implemented in Xolotl to evaluate the effect of the cluster drift due to the elastic cluster-surface interaction that provides the driving force for surface segregation, as a function of the surface orientation. The colored dotted lines indicate the initial implantation depth for 100-eV helium incident on tungsten surfaces at a nominal flux (excluding reflection of helium) of 4 × 1025 m−2s−1 to a fluence of about 3 × 1019 He m−2 at 933 K. The solid lines show the cumulative depth distribution of the helium when only (Fickian) diffusion and clustering reactions are active, while the dashed lines show the effect of including helium surface segregation resulting from the elastic interaction (through drift), which strongly biases the helium and helium cluster diffusion towards the surface, resulting in additional helium desorption from the surface. This effect of surface segregation effectively creates a denuded zone below the tungsten surface, thereby making the depth distribution shift to deeper depths
Figure 5. Cumulative helium distributions at a nominal flux of 4.0 × 1025 He m−2 s−1 and a fluence of 3.3 × 1019 He m−2 for four different surface orientations in the case where only cluster reactions and diffusion are accounted for in the continuum model (labeled ‘diffusion’), and where the cluster drift is added (labeled
‘diffusion + drift’). The initial depth distributions at 100 eV are shown for comparison. The mobile helium, and helium clusters, either diffuse directly to the surface and are released (desorbed) from the surface or diffuse deeper below the surface forming larger helium—vacancy clusters. The influence of the cluster drift resulting from the elastic driving force for surface segregation is evidenced in a deeper depth distribution, as more helium desorbs from the surface.
Figure 6. Cumulative helium distributions at a nominal flux of 4.0 × 1025 He m−2 s−1 and a fluence of 3.3 × 1019 He m−2 for the (1 1 1) surface orientation. As shown in figure 5, adding the drift process to the diffusion leads to helium clusters trapped deeper in the material. If, instead of drift, trap-mutation of helium clusters is activated, the quantity of helium trapped near the surface is greatly increased.

below the surface. It is also important to point out that there is a subtle difference in the strength of this surface segregation, in which the (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) surfaces show a slightly broader denuded zone than the (2 1 1) and (1 1 0) surfaces. Figure 6 shows the effect of systematically including different aspects of the segregation physics into the continuumlevel simulation for helium implantation below a (1 1 1) surface. In figure 6, the cumulative depth distributions are shown at a nominal fluence of about 3 × 1019 He m−2, and the dash dotted and dotted lines show the same curves from figure 5, while the dashed line shows the effect of incorporating into the model the modified trap mutation reactions, as described in table 3 of [17] and in equation (9). In the simulation that yielded the latter set of results, the elastic interaction force that biases the helium diffusion towards the surface facilitating surface segregation was not included, and only Fickian diffusion and reactions of clustering along with a modification of the trap mutation process for small clusters in proximity to the (1 1 1) surface were accounted for. The dashed line in figure 6 clearly shows an influence in the cumulative depth
distribution of maintaining a very high quantity (~70%) of helium within approximately one nanometer of the surface, with the remainder of the depth distribution appearing more normal with respect to the depth distribution resulting from Fickian diffusion and helium clustering (labeled ‘diffusion’). The solid line includes both the modified trap mutation reactions along with the elastically induced drift that promotes surface segregation, in addition to Fickian diffusion and helium clustering, and maintains the qualitative aspect of surface segregation and a large fraction of helium within the first one to two nanometers below the surface, but reduces slightly the amount of helium near the surface. The result of surface segregation shown in figure 6 is generally consistent with the large-scale MD simulation results depicted in figure 4, at least for the early clustering behavior at fluences up to about 3 × 1018 He m−2. Figure 7 shows a quantitative comparison between the cumulative depth distribution of helium from the MD simulations, figures 7(a) and (b), versus those predicted by our Xolotl simulations, figures 7(c) and (d), for 100-eV He implantation below

tungsten surfaces at a nominal flux of 4.0 × 1025 He m−2 s−1 to a fluence of approximately 3.3 × 1018 He m−2, figures 7(a) and (c), and of 3.3 × 1019 He m−2, figures 7(b) and (d). Notably, the results of the MD and continuum-scale simulations are in remarkably good agreement at the lower fluence value of about 3.3 × 1018 He m−2, with both showing much more pronounced surface segregation in the form of retained helium fractions within the first one to two nanometers below the surface that are much higher for the (2 1 1) and (1 1 1) surfaces than for the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) surfaces. While the continuum model predicts a larger quantity of helium in this layer than the MD results, and a stronger effect for the (2 1 1) rather than the (1 1 1) surface, the strong agreement between them is striking, and provides a significant demonstration of the hierarchical multiscale approach to incorporating atomistic information into the continuum-level model. However, over longer times the agreement is not as good, as evidenced by comparing figure 7(b) with 7(d). As shown in figure 4, the differences in surface segregation behavior of helium as a function of surface orientation appear to become less pronounced at longer times. However, the Xolotl simulations, figure 7(d), continue to show a strong effect of surface segregation. The reasons for this discrepancy at the larger fluence of about 3 × 1019 He m−2 are not currently fully understood, although they may relate to a decrease in the efficiency of the clustering reactions for growing large helium—vacancy clusters, or due to the occurrence of helium bubble bursting which is observed in large-scale MD simulations [14, 30] but is not yet incorporated into the continuum simulations. Future efforts will focus on resolving this difference between the higher-fluence predictions at the atomistic and continuum scales, as well as reporting on more detailed inter-comparisons in terms of the total helium retained and the detailed helium cluster concentrations as a function of depth below the surface.
VI. Summary and conclusions
In summary, we conducted a systematic, hierarchical multiscale modeling and simulation study to address the problem of helium segregation on surfaces of plasma-exposed tungsten, a problem with important implications for the design of plasmafacing components of nuclear fusion reactors. We used a reliable, carefully parameterized interatomic interaction potential and employed a hierarchy of atomic-scale simulations, namely, MS simulations to understand the thermodynamic origin of helium surface segregation, targeted MD simulations of near-surface cluster reactions, and large-scale MD simulations of implanted helium evolution in plasma-exposed tungsten. From the MS and targeted MD simulations we found that mobile Hen (1 ⩽ n ⩽ 7) clusters in the near-surface region are attracted to the surface due to an elastic interaction force that provides the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation and facilitates helium segregation on the surface; the clusters’ drift toward the surface enables cluster reactions, most importantly trap mutation, in the near-surface region at rates much higher than those of the corresponding reactions in the bulk material. This near-surface cluster dynamics have
significant effects on the surface morphology, near-surface defect structures, and the amount of helium retained in the material upon plasma exposure; these morphological, structural, and compositional effects are observed in large-scale MD simulations. We integrated the findings of our atomicscale simulations into a properly parameterized continuumscale cluster transport-reaction dynamics model, which was validated by comparisons of its predictions with those of the large-scale MD simulations. Simulations based on our coarse-grained cluster-dynamics model are, therefore, an efficient computational means for predicting implanted helium evolution, surface segregation, and its near-surface effects in tungsten. The most important comparisons, in the context of our study, are those between the large-scale MD simulation results and the predictions of the Xolotl simulations under consistent helium implantation conditions. Given that our computations involved single-crystalline tungsten with well-specified surface orientations, i.e. simpler structures and much better characterized surfaces than those used in available experimental studies, a systematic comparison of our findings with those reported in experimental works in the literature is well beyond the scope of this article. However, our findings are generally in qualitative agreement with those of experimental studies with well characterized samples over a range of implantation conditions. For example, a recent experimental study [43] reported He concentrations in various tungsten surfaces, including fuzzy surfaces, as a function of surface temperature and He fluence. Over the temperature of 470–2595 K and the
He fluence range of 3 × 1024–1.3 × 1027 m−2 examined, the measured He concentration was found to be over the range of 1–4 at.%, i.e. much higher than the solubility of He in W [43]. This is a high He retention that does not exhibit any strong temperature dependence, which is consistent with our computational findings, where the dominant, low-barrier trap mutation reactions retain He in the near-surface region of tungsten, trapped in the form of Hem − Vk complexes, as the small mobile helium clusters undergo drift diffusional transport toward the surface. Our cluster-dynamics model, implemented computationally through Xolotl, is a fully atomistically informed coarsegrained model that sets the stage for computationally efficient simulation predictions of helium surface segregation, helium retention, and surface morphological evolution toward optimal design of plasma facing components. The physics of surface segregation, cluster transport, and cluster reactions in the bulk and near the surface are incorporated into our present clusterdynamics modeling framework. Extending this framework to include helium bubble physics, away from the dilute limit of helium concentration, and their impact on surface morphology and near-surface structure is currently under way and will be reported in forthcoming publications.
