Title:          Ordered Media in Chemical Separations
Subject:        ACS SYMPOSIUM SERIES 342
Keywords:       The ACS SYMPOSIUM SERIES was founded in 1974 to provide a
medium for publishing symposia quickly in book form. The
format of the Series parallels that of the continuing ADVANCES
IN CHEMISTRY SERIES except that, in order to save time, the
papers are not typeset but are reproduced as they are submitted
by the authors in camera-ready form. Papers are reviewed under
the supervision of the Editors with the assistance of the Series
Advisory Board and are selected to maintain the integrity of the
symposia; however, verbatim reproductions of previously published
papers are not accepted. Both reviews and reports of
research are acceptable, because symposia may embrace both
types of presentation.
