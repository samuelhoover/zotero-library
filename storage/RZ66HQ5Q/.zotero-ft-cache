ABSTRACT: Predicting binary solution phase behavior of polymers has remained a challenge since the early theory of Flory−Huggins, hindering the processing, synthesis, and design of polymeric materials. Herein, we take a complementary data-driven approach by building a machine learning framework to make fast and accurate predictions of polymer solution cloud point temperatures. Using polystyrene, both upper and lower critical solution temperatures are predicted within experimental uncertainty (1−2 °C) with a deep neural network, Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, and a combination of polymer, solvent, and state features. The GPR model also enables intelligent exploration of solution phase space, where as little as 25 cloud points are required to make predictions within 2 °C for polystyrene of arbitrary molecular weight in cyclohexane. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning for the prediction of liquid−liquid equilibrium of polymer solutions and establishes a framework to incorporate other polymers and complex macromolecular architectures.
T
he solubility of polymers is essential to the synthesis, processing, purification, and self-assembly of polymeric materials. Predicting regions of miscibility as a function of polymer and solvent properties has remained a challenge. Our earliest understanding of polymer solution thermodynamics
began with the lattice model of Flory and Huggins.1−6 While Flory−Huggins theory can capture the phase behavior quantitatively for a few select polymer−solvent combinations, the earliest versions of this theory are oversimplified due to its
underlying assumptions.3 Thus, additional lattice models and improvements have been derived based on the original Flory−
Huggins model.7−17 Other models followed, such as equation
of state (EoS),18 quantity structure−property relationship
(QSPR),19,20 and activity coefficient models.21,22 Many of these models require solving multiple complex equations simultaneously that are highly sensitive to the initial guess or require properties of the pure components that are either unknown or difficult to measure. In most cases, only qualitative agreement with experiments can be obtained, and each polymer−solvent system requires its own model parametrization. Reasons behind the discrepancies between standard Flory−Huggins theory and experimental data remain un
known.23 In the past few years, there has been substantial interest in using machine learning (ML) to accelerate the design of
polymer materials.24−28 Supervised learning algorithms for regression have shown promise for their quick and accurate predictions but typically require a data set size on the order of 104−105. In materials science, where data can be scarce, ML models provide a way to explore a vast parameter space efficiently using active learning or high-throughput exper
imentation using AI decision making.29,30 Coexistence behavior of polymers and solvents is representative of this challenge, depending on a large set of polymer (architecture, composition, molecular weights, polydispersity, etc.), solvent (composition, concentration, etc.), and processing (pressure, temperature, etc.) characteristics. To demonstrate a framework for data-driven prediction of liquid−liquid equilibrium (LLE), we predict cloud point temperatures using available LLE data on binary solutions of polystyrene (PS) in various solvents. We select polystyrene for our case study due to it being the most widely studied
polymer.31 The highly nonlinear coexistence behavior requires state-of-the-art ML regression models, such as deep neural networks (DNN) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) models used here, where the choice of the ML model is dependent on a number of factors including performance, training time, and required training data. Furthermore, our GPR model is implemented as an active learning algorithm to simulate autonomous exploration of the vast parameter set beginning with a small amount of data. While this work focuses on PS, the framework may be expanded to other polymers, solvents, and blends, including effects of various polymer chemistries, architectures, and multicomponent systems, by expanding the proposed feature vector.

We obtain cloud points or coexistence data from the CRC Handbook of Liquid−Liquid Equilibrium Data of Polymer
Solutions.32 A total of 3263 cloud points are processed for polystyrene in 19 different solvents (solvents are listed in Table S1). Details of the data extraction and processing criteria (specifically which cloud points were included) can be found in the Supporting Information. It is not surprising to see that the most widely studied solvent for PS is cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane (see Figure S1). Additionally, there are significantly more upper critical solubility (UCS) than lower critical solubility (LCS) cloud points. This is primarily because LCS behavior is typically found above the boiling point of the solvent or at temperatures where the polymer begins to
degrade.33 For some solvents, there are only UCS or LCS cloud points available, with most solvents having less than 100 cloud points. Nevertheless, the amount of available data is excellent for developing our feature vector and machine learning model. A primary challenge in machine learning models is determining the feature vector input with an optimal set of polymer, solvent, and state descriptors. Ideally, the solvent feature would be a molecule descriptor that accounts for the different affinities between PS and the various solvents. Several possible descriptors range from fingerprinting methods that represents the molecule structure numerically, to empirical
surrogates, such as the Hildebrand parameter34,35 and Hansen
solubility parameters (HSPs).36 All three have been used previously to determine whether a polymer is soluble in a
particular solvent.37,38 Topological “fingerprints” have the benefit of predicting polymer solubility curves based on structure alone; however, their use will substantially increase the size of the input feature vector and computational burden. Alternatively, limitations such as the availability of HSPs for polymers or the Hildebrand parameter being inaccurate for
polar molecules hinder their use in generalized models.37 Regardless, ML and other methods have been used to estimate HSPs for unknown polymers, which provide an avenue for
building a comprehensive HSP database.39−41 The homopolymer features are defined as the weight-average molecular weight (Mw), volume fraction (φ), and polydispersity index (PDI). The state features include pressure and temperature (the target feature). Our first approach combined the above solvent, polymer, and state features to create the input feature vector. However, this was found to be ineffective to model both UCS and LCS demixing regions in the T−φ phase space and necessitated the addition of a “one-phase
region” binary descriptor, where each individual cloud point is assigned a parameter as to whether the one-phase region emerges with increasing (“0”) or decreasing (“1”) temperature. This allows the model to predict various solubility curve behaviors, such as the hourglass and closed-loop shapes
commonly seen with poor solvents.31 To further account for hypercritical points where neither an increase or decrease in temperature leads to the one-phase region, this feature can be expanded to a unit vector in T−φ−P space that points to the one-phase region (see Supporting Information). A summary of the feature vector can be found in Table S2. Figure 1 explores the results of the trained DNN model with three hidden layers using HSPs for the solvent feature (HSPs are listed in Table S1 for polystyrene and solvents). Details of the architecture choice, hyperparameter tuning, training protocols, preprocessing pipeline, and five-fold cross-validation are discussed in the Supporting Information. We implement an 80:10:10 split for the train, validation, and test set, respectively, using a stratified sampling method based on the number of UCS/LCS cloud points for each solvent. Comparisons to a random split are found in Table S3 and Figure S7. Parity plots for the UCS and LCS branch data are shown in Figure 1a,b. Remarkably, we find that the DNN model can predict the test cloud point temperatures with root mean square error (RMSE) values within 1−3 °C for polystyrene in various solvents. Mean absolute error (MAE) values show test predictions are, on average, within 1 °C for UCS cloud points and 2.5 °C for LCS cloud points. This is within experimental uncertainty (typically 1−2 °C between reported values). As expected, the error is larger for the LCS cloud points due to less available training data. Values reported in Figure 1 are similar to the average values reported in Table S3, indicating the DNN performance is not an artifact of a single train/test split. Note that the use of the Hildebrand parameter as a solvent feature increases RMSE values by 1−2 °C (see Figure S10; Hildebrand parameters for polystyrene and solvents are listed in Table S2). Although Hildebrand is more widely available than Hansen solubility parameters for polymers, Hildebrand is not effective when secondary intermolecular interactions (dipole, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, etc.) dominate. Results for the DNN model using the solvent fingerprint feature performs similarly well (see Supporting Information). This suggests that solvents with similar fingerprints will also have similar solubility behavior, consistent with the excellent predictability using the HSP feature. The input layer to this model requires 64 solvent descriptors (each bit is counted as a

single feature) compared to the three HSP values. This only increases the training time by about 10%. Alternative fingerprinting methods, including dimensionality reduction to choose the most important fingerprint features, may be used to increase computational efficiency. Nevertheless, the benefit of using fingerprints is the ability to generalize to polymers and solvents with unknown HSP values. Finally, note that expanding this framework to include other polymer architectures (i.e., block copolymers, star-branched, etc.) will require additional polymer features, and therefore reducing the number of input features where possible is crucial. Therefore, HSPs are a useful compromise descriptor with respect to model performance and enable open architecture for future expansion and automation via preprocessing routines that can provide dimensionally reduced descriptors of polymer−solvent interactions optimized for equilibrium phase behavior. In Figure 2, we plot example predicted coexistence curves against the observed data points for several solvents. Neural networks are known to perform well with larger data sets, and we find that the largest error contributions are for solvents with
the smallest amount of training data (see Figure S7 for a plot of the average test MAE values for each solvent). Solvents such as cyclohexane (UCS, Figure 2a) and tert-butyl acetate (LCS, Figure 2b) show great agreement between predicted and observed coexistence curves, with the predicted curves exhibiting typical UCS and LCS curve shapes. Examples of the poorest predictions are shown for UCS and LCS behavior in methyl acetate (Figure 2c,d). Due to the lack of data, especially for the LCS predictions, the coexistence curve shape is poor but still qualitatively consistent with typical UCS and LCS curves, with individual predictions close to experimental uncertainty. Finally, by including pressure as a state feature, the model is able to predict isopleths as seen by the excellent agreement between observed and predicted cloud points for eight different polymer volume fractions (Figure 2e). Overall, these results demonstrate the feasibility of using a deep learning model to predict solubility curves accurately. The training data used in the DNN model contain only 65 cloud points for cyclopentane and seven PS molecular weights ranging from 43.0 to 1300 kDa. To determine whether our

model can generalize to unknown molecular weights, we choose to examine new cloud points at Mw = 268 and 900 kDa (chosen at random). In Figure 2f, we report the experimental cloud points for polystyrene in cyclopentane measured via UV−vis spectroscopy (experimental details can be found in the Supporting Information). Comparing our model’s predictions with the new cloud points, we see that our predictions are within 1−2 °C, which is in agreement with the test RMSE of our DNN model. Hence, our predictions generalize well to unknown molecular weights for cyclopentane, indicating that our model is able to predict entire curves in the T−φ−Mw plane for similar solvents. One popular ML algorithm gaining interest in materials science is Gaussian process regression, which is a nonparametric model that works well with small data sets and
can provide uncertainty in its predictions.42 We compare the above DNN model with a GPR model and discuss its value in the active learning of polymer solubility. For the GPR model, we specify a Gaussian prior over the latent coexistence curve consisting of the constant kernel combined with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel as the covariance function. Additional details including kernel choice, hyperparameter tuning, training protocols, and five-fold cross-validation can be found in the Supporting Information. Results of the GPR model (comparisons to Figures 1 and 2) are summarized in Figures S15 and S16. One significance to using the RBF kernel is that we can predict smoother curves, as values close in input space will have similar output predictions. This can be seen by the predicted coexistence curves for select solvents, including isopleths and predictions for unknown cyclopentane Mw, in Figure S16. Closed-loop AI is becoming increasingly important to highthroughput experimentation. In most cases, experiments are run via a grid search on a particular phase space, which can be highly inefficient. Alternatively, we may use ML models to drive experimentation for active learning. To demonstrate this capability with our GPR model, we take a subset of the polystyrene data set and select all cyclohexane UCS-type cloud points at atmospheric pressure. Assuming we have no information on polystyrene solubility in cyclohexane and want to efficiently explore the T−φ−Mw phase space, we select a range of polymer molecular weights and volume fractions we wish to explore. In this case, we have data for 38 molecular weights ranging from 20.4 to 2700 kDa and one extreme value of 13,200 kDa. The input to the GPR model is the polymer molecular weight, volume fraction, and polydispersity. Additional model details and hyperparameters can be found in the Supporting Information. Figure 3 shows the results for the RMSE, R2, and fraction of polymer molecular weights sampled during the phase space exploration of polystyrene in cyclohexane. Beginning with five random samples, subsequent cloud points are added to the training data set and are chosen based on (i) the GPR prediction with the largest uncertainty (“exploration”) or (ii) randomly (see Supporting Information for details on the algorithm). This is repeated 20 times with different initial samples, and results are averaged. Interestingly, we find that sampling the prediction with the largest uncertainty allows the model to reach an RMSE less than 1.5 °C with much less samples compared to random sampling. Our model obtains an RMSE < 2 and R2 > 0.8 in about 25 samples. This means, on average, 957 of the 982 cloud points can be predicted within 2 °C when using the GPR predictions to guide phase space
exploration. Additionally, we show the fraction of polymer molecular weights sampled as a function of training set size in Figure 3c. By 50 samples, our model obtains an R2 coefficient of ∼0.9 with only half of the molecular weights sampled. Prediction curves using the GPR model trained on 50 samples are plotted in Figures S19−S22, showing significant improvements using GPR to guide phase space sampling rather than random sampling. This demonstrates that intelligent exploration of phase space requires only a small number of experiments to obtain accurate cloud point predictions. As a result, autonomous exploration of the vast parameter space of polymer solubility behavior is possible with the GPR model. In summary, we demonstrate that a DNN model can make fast and accurate predictions of coexistence curves with RMSE values within experimental uncertainty. The GPR model is able to predict smoother curves and calculate prediction uncertainties which we show is beneficial for active learning. Furthermore, the use of reduced descriptors, such as HSPs for polymer−solvent interactions, enables a hierarchical openarchitecture framework that balances model efficiency, such as for active learning, with computational complexity of describing structure−composition space, such as with the fingerprinting method. It is important to note that machine learning models enable a single model for arbitrary polymer/ solvent systems but at the expense of understanding the underlying physics. This is contrary to physics-based models that provide a fundamental understanding of polymer solubility

but require different parameters for various polymer/solvent systems. Although the model herein used PS data exclusively, the framework is expandable to other polymers using available
literature data32 or implementing an automated high-rate experimental cloud point apparatus using active learning to identify the most impactful new data to reduce prediction error (i.e., polymer−solvent concentration). Also, cloud point measurements should also be predictable for star-branched, block copolymers, and other macromolecular architectures with the addition of structural features. Finally, while the above results demonstrate the capabilities of data-driven machine learning models for polymer solubility, the size of the feature vector necessary to capture all characteristics of macromolecules and their behavior in different environments will exasperate the sparse data challenge. Thus, physics-informed ML will be crucial for boarding utility and generality and providing better predictions and effective use of prior knowledge to minimize the required amount of training data.
