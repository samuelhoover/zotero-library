ABSTRACT: Despite the extensive interest in applications of plasmid DNA, there have been few direct measurements of the root mean square radius of gyration, RG, of different plasmid isoforms over a broad range of plasmid size. Static light scattering data were obtained using supercoiled, opencircular, and linear isoforms of 5.76, 9.80, and 16.8 kbp plasmids. The results from this study extend the range of RG values available in the literature to plasmid sizes typically used for gene therapy and DNA vaccines. The experimental data were compared with available theoretical expressions based on the worm-like chain model, with the best-fit value of the apparent persistence length for both the linear and open-circular isoforms being statistically identical at 46 nm. A new expression was developed for the radius of gyration of the supercoiled plasmid based on a model for linear DNA using an effective contour length that is equal to a fraction of the total contour length. These results should facilitate the development of micro/nano-fluidic devices for DNA manipulation and size-based separation processes for plasmid DNA purification. Biotechnol.

Introduction
The size of plasmid DNA is critical to understanding their behavior in micro/nano-fluidic devices (Douville et al., 2008; Han and Craighead, 2000; Stein et al., 2006) and in size-based separation processes such as gel electrophoresis (Holmes and Stellwagen, 1991) and size exclusion chromatography (Latulippe and Zydney, 2009). For example, Stein et al. (2006) identified two distinct regimes for pressure-driven DNA transport in microfluidic channels, with the transition between these regimes occurring when the channel
half-height is approximately equal to the radius of gyration. Latulippe and Zydney (2009) recently showed that the partitioning behavior of plasmid DNA in size exclusion chromatography is determined primarily by the radius of gyration, independent of the specific DNA topology. Plasmid DNA is naturally found in a compact supercoiled isoform characterized by a ‘‘self-coiling’’ of the DNA double helix. A variety of enzymatic, chemical, or mechanical (shear) processes can cause a nick or break in one strand of the double helix resulting in the open-circular isoform. A break in both strands of the DNA double helix gives linear DNA. Despite the widespread interest in plasmid DNA for cloning, gene therapy, and as DNA-based vaccines, there have been relatively few fundamental studies of the effective size of the different plasmid isoforms. Static light scattering (SLS) measures the time-averaged intensity of scattered light as a function of scattering angle, yielding information on the structure of the macromolecule including the root mean square radius of gyration (RG) and the molecular weight (M). RG is defined as the average distance between the individual base pair units and the DNA center of mass averaged over the ensemble of available conformations. The radius of gyration is a particularly useful descriptor of the size of the plasmid DNA because it can be defined for any polymer structure/topology, including the different plasmid isoforms. Early SLS studies of DNA used fractionated samples from calf-thymus, lambda phage, or T7 phage (Cohen and Eisenberg, 1966; Dawson and Harpst, 1971; Doty et al., 1958; Harpst et al., 1968), all of which contained a high concentration of DNA fragments and/or aggregates of different size. Thus, there are significant concerns about the accuracy of the reported RG results for the large DNA used in these studies. Other SLS studies have provided RG values for linear and open-circular isoforms but only for plasmids <7 kilo-base pairs (kbp) in length. Robertson et al. (2006) estimated RG values over a wide range of DNA sizes (6 to 290 kbp) from the measured diffusion coefficient determined Correspondence to: A. L. Zydney by single-molecule imaging of fluorescent-labeled DNA.

However, the limited resolution of this technique prevents an accurate determination of RG. Several theoretical structural models have been used to estimate the molecular size of plasmid DNA. The simplest approach is the freely jointed chain (FJC) model which neglects any interactions between the DNA base pairs. The worm-like chain (WLC) model has been shown to provide a more appropriate physical model for small and intermediate size DNA molecules since it accounts for both the local stiffness and the long-range flexibility of the DNA. Theoretical expressions for RG using the WLC model are available only for the linear and circular chains. Brownian dynamics algorithms have been used to predict the RG of supercoiled DNA (Hammermann et al., 1997; Vologodskii and Cozzarelli, 1994); however, the results from these simulations have not been extensively validated due to the lack of experimental RG data over a range of plasmid sizes. Zakharova et al. (2002) presented an expression for RG of an elongated supercoil without end loops in terms of the superhelix dimensions; however, Prazeres (2008) showed that this expression significantly overestimated RG for supercoiled DNA. Thus, there are no appropriate analytical expressions currently available to describe the radius of gyration of supercoiled plasmid DNA. The objective of this study was to evaluate RG of the supercoiled, open-circular, and linear isoforms of 5.76, 9.80, and 16.8 kbp plasmids using SLS experiments. The data were analyzed by accounting for the contribution from low levels of higher molecular weight dimers as well as the effect of plasmid morphology on the scattering form factor. The results thus provide some of the most accurate RG values for all three plasmid isoforms over a broader range of plasmid size. In particular, the RG data extend the results available in the literature to plasmid sizes more typically used in gene therapy and DNA vaccine applications (i.e., up to 20 kbp). The calculated RG values for the linear and open-circular plasmids were in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the WLC model. A new analytical expression for the radius of gyration of the supercoiled isoform was developed using the WLC model, allowing accurate estimates of RG values for all three isoforms over a wide range of plasmid size.
Materials and Methods
SLS experiments were performed using a DAWN EOS instrument (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) with a 30 mW vertically polarized GaAs laser (polarization ratio >100:1) operating at a wavelength of 690 nm. Samples were prepared in 20 mL cylindrical scintillation vials and loaded into a vial holder unit containing 18 photodiode voltage detectors located at fixed angles from 22.58 to 1478 relative to the transmitted light. All measurements were performed at room temperature (25  28C). The scintillation vials were visually inspected for scratches and then cleaned as follows. The vials were placed in a
laminar-flow dust-free fume hood and filled with 10 mL of deionized water (Barnstead NANOpure1 DIamondTM) that had been filtered through an Acrodisc Supor 0.2 mm pore size syringe filter (Pall, Ann Arbor, MI). The vials were capped, manually shaken for approximately 20 s, and then emptied. This procedure was repeated for at least three washes. The vials were then placed upside-down on a rack and allowed to dry in the fume hood overnight. The light scattering instrument was calibrated with HPLC-grade toluene (EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ) using the output from the 908 detector. The scintillation vial was filled with toluene that had been pre-filtered through an Anotop 0.02 mm pore size syringe filter (GE Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). The signals from the other 17 detectors were then normalized relative to the output from the 90o detector using data for a 5 mg/mL solution of bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Stock solutions of the 5.76, 9.80, and 16.8 kbp supercoiled plasmids were prepared by Aldevron (Fargo, ND). The linear and open-circular isoforms of the 5.76 kbp plasmid were prepared in our laboratory by enzymatic digestion of the supercoiled isoform using PaeR7I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and Nb.BsrDI (New England Biolabs), respectively. For each digestion, 100 mg of the supercoiled isoform was mixed with solutions containing 1 U/mg of enzyme. For example, the digestion mixture for the linear isoform was prepared as follows: 215 mL deionized water, 30 mL 10 NE buffer 2, 50 mL supercoiled plasmid solution, and 5 mL PaeR7I enzyme. The digestion mixtures were incubated at 378C for 3 h. A similar approach was used for the other plasmids: 1 U/mg KpnI (New England Biolabs) and 1 U/ mg Nt.AlwI (New England Biolabs) were used for the 9.80 kbp plasmid and 2 U/mg PaeR7I and 1.5 U/mg Nt.AlwI were used for the 16.8 kbp plasmid. The buffer concentrate 10 NE buffer 2 was used in all of the digestion mixtures. Therefore, in order to match exactly the final buffer conditions for all three isoforms, the stock solution of the supercoiled isoform (which was not digested enzymatically) was simply diluted with an appropriate volume of the buffer concentrate. For example, for the 5.76 kbp plasmid, 50 mL of the supercoiled plasmid solution was diluted with 220 mL deionized water and 30 mL 10 NE buffer 2. Light scattering data were obtained for plasmid concentrations from 2 to 27 mg/mL, each prepared by diluting the post-digestion/dilution solution of the given isoform with appropriate amounts of 10 mM Na2EDTA—200 mM NaCl with the pH adjusted to 6.2 using small amounts of 1 M NaOH. This is the same buffer used by Jolly and Eisenberg (1976) in their light scattering studies of DNA. The solution with the lowest DNA concentration was prepared by diluting the plasmid solution approximately 120:1; the resulting solution contained 9.9 mM Na2EDTA, 199 mM NaCl, and trace amounts (<0.1 mM) of the other species present in the NE buffer concentrate (Tris–HCl, MgCl2, and dithiothreitol). The solution with the highest DNA concentration contained 9 mM Na2EDTA, 186 mM NaCl, and less than 1 mM of the other buffer concentrate

species. The highest DNA concentration used in this study was approximately 4–6 times lower than reported DNA overlap concentrations (Laib et al., 2006); thus, intermolecular interactions should be negligible in all experiments. The plasmid concentration in each solution was determined using a NanoDrop UV spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). DNA samples were filtered directly into the pre-cleaned scintillation vials using Acrodisc GHP 0.45 mm pore size 25 mm syringe filters (Pall) that had been pre-flushed with the same buffer solution used for diluting the plasmid solutions. All samples were stored at 48C until analysis to minimize endonuclease activity. A blank sample containing no DNA was prepared using the same buffer solution. The structure and purity of the different plasmid isoforms were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Horizontal gels were prepared by dissolving agarose in Tris–acetateEDTA buffer to a final concentration of 0.75% (mass percentage). TrackItTM 1 kbp DNA ladder (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and plasmid solutions containing TrackItTM loading buffer were loaded into the gel. Gels were run at 50 V for 4 h in a Mini-Sub Cell GT (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The gels were subsequently stained with 120 mL of SYBR1 Gold solution (Invitrogen) for 18 h on a rocker platform. Gel images were captured using a UV trans-illuminator.
Results
Plasmid DNA Characterization
The quality of the plasmid stock solution, the effectiveness of the digestions used to generate the open-circular and linear isoforms, and the possibility of shear damage during DNA filtration were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples were collected directly from the syringe filter as each scintillation vial was filled with plasmid solution. Control tests verified that there was no loss of DNA during the filtration; the post-filtering concentration was statistically indistinguishable ( p-value >0.3) from the pre-filtering value. A sample image for the different isoforms of the 5.76 kbp plasmid is shown in Figure 1. The stock solution (lane 2 of Fig. 1) was predominantly in the monomeric supercoiled isoform (bright band in lane 2) but appeared to contain a small amount of higher molecular weight species (faint band in lane 2). In contrast, the linear sample (lane 3 of Fig. 1) contained only the linear isoform. This suggests that the larger impurities present in the supercoiled sample are entangled or ‘‘looped’’ dimers (i.e., DNA catenanes) that are separated upon enzymatic digestion of the DNA; in this case the term dimer is used to refer to any higher molecular weight species formed by joining/linking of two individual (i.e., ‘‘monomeric’’) plasmid species with known number of base pairs. The open-circular sample (lane 4 of Fig. 1) was also mostly in the monomeric open-circular form, although there are two faint bands at the top of the gel similar to that seen in the supercoiled sample. Similar results were obtained with both the 9.80 and 16.8 kbp plasmids (images not shown), with the open
circular isoform always migrating the shortest distance through the gel (corresponding to the largest effective size) followed by the linear and then the supercoiled isoforms. There was no detectable DNA damage during filtration for any of the plasmids; agarose gel images obtained for unfiltered samples were identical to those obtained for filtered samples. Also, all enzymatic digestions were performed in the absence of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Digestions performed in the presence of BSA, as specifically recommended for the KpnI enzyme, appeared fine in the agarose gel electrophoresis, but the presence of the BSA interfered with the SLS analysis leading to negative values of the second virial coefficient and significant discrepancies in the values for the radius of gyration and molecular weight.
Static Light Scattering Data
Experimental data for the scattering intensity of the linear 5.76 kbp plasmid as a function of scattering angle at three different plasmid concentrations are shown in the form of a Zimm plot (Zimm, 1948) in Figure 2. The data are plotted as Kc/Ru versus sin2(u/2) þ kc where K is an instrument constant, c is the plasmid concentration, Ru is the Rayleigh ratio, u is the

angle between the transmitted light and each detector, and k is a constant that graphically spreads out the data but does not affect the subsequent analysis. The instrument constant is directly proportional to the square of the specific refractive index increment (dn/dc) and is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (l) of the incident light (Tanford, 1961). The instrument constant for the DAWN EOS was evaluated as K 1⁄4 1.343  1011 mol m2/g2 using dn/ dc 1⁄4 0.162 mL/g at l 1⁄4 690 nm, where dn/dc was determined by extrapolation of literature data obtained with calf thymus DNA over a range of wavelength in the same buffer as employed in this study (Jolly and Eisenberg, 1976). The Rayleigh ratio is defined as the ratio of scattered light intensity to incident light intensity per unit volume multiplied by the square of the distance from the detector to the solution cell. The light scattering intensity can be related to the macromolecule structural properties as (Tanford, 1961):
Kc
Ru
1⁄41
PðuÞ

M þ 2A2c þ   

(1)
The scattering form factor, P(u), accounts for intramolecular interference effects due to the relatively large size of the plasmid DNA and is described using the scattering vector (q):
q 1⁄4 4pn0
l sin u
2

(2)
where n0 is the refractive index of the solvent. The molecular weight (M) and second virial coefficient (A2) can thus be calculated directly from the intercept and slope of the zero scattering angle extrapolation (dashed line in Fig. 2) of the light scattering data since P(u) has a value of 1 when u 1⁄4 08. The molecular weight of the plasmid, determined from the intercept of the zero scattering angle extrapolation on the yaxis (where c 1⁄4 0), was M 1⁄4 3.67  0.26  106 Da for the 5.76 kbp plasmid. For comparison, the approximate molecular weight of the bare 5.76 kbp plasmid is 3.55  106 Da using an average molecular weight of 616 Da per base pair. However, the negative charges on the phosphate groups along the DNA backbone should be strongly associated with the positive counterions in solution. Assuming that all counterions are Naþ (yielding an average molecular weight of 662 Da per base pair), the effective molecular weight of the plasmid becomes M 1⁄4 3.81  106 Da. Thus, the calculated values for M span the experimental result determined from the light scattering data. The best-fit value of the second virial coefficient is calculated from the slope of the zero scattering angle extrapolation giving A2 1⁄4 4.7  4.5  104 mol mL/g2. The slightly positive value of A2 corresponds to a weak intermolecular repulsion between the negatively charged plasmids. Voordouw et al. (1978) and Jolly and Eisenberg (1976) reported similar values of A2 1⁄4 3.0
5.4  104 mol mL/g2 for linear DNA in buffer solutions containing 200 mM NaCl.
Radius of Gyration
According to Equation (1), the scattering form factor can be evaluated directly from the zero-concentration extrapolation of the light scattering data (solid line in Fig. 2). The experimental values of 1/P(u) were plotted versus q2 as the discrete symbols in Figure 3. The radius of gyration (RG) of the plasmid can be evaluated from theoretical expressions for the angular dependence of the scattering form factor. Debye (1947) developed an expression for the scattering form factor of a linear random Gaussian coil chain:

where u 1⁄4 q2R2
G. The best-fit value of RG, determined by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals between the model and data (for q2R2
G values less than 4), was 174  2 nm. The model calculations using Equation (3), shown by the solid curve in Figure 3, are in good agreement with the data at low q2 but show significant deviations for q2 > 1.5  104 nm2. This deviation is due to the inability of the theoretical expression to properly capture the scattering behavior at large scattering angles (Voordouw et al., 1978). The best-fit value of RG increased slightly as the number of fitted data points (i.e., detectors) decreased. The error in the best-fit value of RG was estimated from the

maximum difference between the best-fit values of RG using data sets with one more and one less data point. Corresponding light scattering experiments were performed with the open-circular and supercoiled isoforms of the 5.76 kbp plasmid. The molecular weights of the opencircular and supercoiled isoforms were again determined using Zimm plots (not shown) from the intercept of the zero scattering angle extrapolation giving M 1⁄4 4.23  0.27  106 and 3.92  0.06  106 Da, respectively. These values are both larger than the value determined for the corresponding linear DNA, which is consistent with the presence of a small number of higher molecular weight species in the agarose gels for both the open-circular and supercoiled isoforms (see gel in Fig. 1). The measured (weight average) molecular weight:
MW 1⁄4
P
i niMi2
P

(4)
was thus used to calculate the number fraction (ni) of the monomer species assuming that the actual molecular weight of the monomers and dimers are known (M1 1⁄4 3.81  106 Da and M2 1⁄4 2  M1 based on the calculated molecular weight for the plasmid assuming complete association of all phosphate groups with Naþ) yielding n1 1⁄4 0.94 for the open-circular plasmid and n1 1⁄4 0.98 for the supercoiled. These values are consistent with the 96% purity reported in the corresponding certificate of analysis from Aldevron.
The second virial coefficients for the open-circular and supercoiled isoforms were determined from the slope of the zero scattering angle extrapolation as done previously for the linear isoform yielding A2 1⁄4 4.8  3.3  104 and 0.8  0.9 
104 mol mL/g2, respectively. These values are in good agreement with previous results obtained by Voordouw et al. (1978) for a 6.59 kbp plasmid, A2 1⁄4 4.8 and 0.7 
104 mol mL/g2 for the open-circular and supercoiled isoforms. The smaller value of A2 for the supercoiled isoform is likely due to the more compact size of the supercoiled plasmid. The scattering form factors for the supercoiled and opencircular isoforms were evaluated from the zero-concentration extrapolation, analogous to the approach described previously for the linear plasmid, with the results shown in Figure 3. The values of the scattering form factor for the open-circular isoform are uniformly larger than those for the supercoiled isoform. The P(u) data were analyzed using an expression for the scattering form factor of a circular flexible chain, developed from analysis of a linear Gaussian chain with zero end-to-end vector, as presented by Casassa (1965):

were determined by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals between the model and data using results at low q2. The radius of gyration of the monomer was then determined from Equation (6) using the ni values calculated previously from the molecular weight data assuming that the squared radius of gyration of the dimer was equal to twice that for the monomer. The assumption that R2

should be valid for dimers formed from two DNA monomers joined end-to-end based on predictions of either the FJC or WLC models (for relatively large plasmids) as discussed subsequently. This analysis gives RG 1⁄4 130  3 nm for the monomeric form of the open-circular isoform and RG 1⁄4 102  2 nm for the supercoiled isoform. Calculations performed assuming that the dimer is formed by linking two DNA monomers (i.e., forming a DNA catenane) gave slightly larger values of the radius of gyration with RG 1⁄4 135  3 and 103  2 nm for the open-circular and supercoiled isoforms, respectively.

the topology of similar structures presented by Pakula and Jeszka (1999). Note that the agarose gel electrophoresis for the open-circular and supercoiled isoforms showed two different higher molecular weight species (the two faint bands at the top of the gel in Fig. 1), likely corresponding to the end-to-end and linked chain morphologies, with the actual RG values lying between the values calculated above for these two dimer structures. Corresponding light scattering experiments were conducted with the linear, open-circular, and supercoiled isoforms of the 9.80 and 16.8 kbp plasmids, with the values for M again determined from the zero scattering angle extrapolation. The results are summarized in Table I. The calculated molecular weights for the linear isoforms were M 1⁄4 6.50  0.60  106 Da for the 9.80 kbp plasmid and 10.7  0.2  106 Da for the 16.8 kbp plasmid, both of which are in good agreement with the expected values of 6.49  106 and 11.1  106 Da assuming full association of the phosphate groups with Naþ counterions. The other columns in Table I show the calculated values of the radius of gyration for the different isoforms. In each case, the RG values were determined from fitting the scattering form factor to the appropriate theoretical expressions (Equations 3 and 5). The calculation of the RG values for the open-circular and supercoiled isoforms also accounted for the fraction of monomers and dimers in the plasmid sample as determined from the weight average molecular weight assuming R2

best-fit values of RG for the linear 9.80 and 16.8 kbp isoforms are RG 1⁄4 213  3 and 242  3 nm, respectively. The radii of gyration for the linear isoforms were uniformly larger than the values for the open-circular isoforms for all three plasmid sizes, and these were in turn larger than the RG values for the supercoiled plasmids.
Comparison With Literature
There have been relatively few studies of the effect of plasmid length (i.e., number of base-pairs) and structure (i.e., isoform topology) on the RG values of plasmid DNA. The data for the linear and open-circular isoforms for the 9.80
and 16.8 kbp plasmids used in this study are unique since the current literature only contains results for these isoforms for DNA ranging from 2.7 to 6.6 kbp. Figure 4 compares the RG values determined in this study (shown as open symbols) with results from the literature (filled symbols). We have not included results from studies of fractionated DNA (typically from calf-thymus, lambda phage, or T7 phage) since these samples are known to contain high concentrations of DNA fragments and/or aggregates of different sizes. Additionally, data are only shown for experiments performed with buffers having ionic strength between 100 and 200 mM since the radius of gyration is known to be a function of solution ionic strength due to changes in the strength of intramolecular electrostatic repulsion (Gebe et al., 1996; Hammermann et al., 1997). The results for the linear isoform are given in the top panel of Figure 4 along with data from the literature (Borochov et al., 1981; Kam et al., 1981; Lewis, 1986; Seils and Dorfmuller, 1991; Voordouw et al., 1978). In general, the results from this study are in good agreement with prior data, effectively extending the range of RG values to plasmids above 7 kbp. The RG value obtained for the 5.76 kbp linear isoform is approximately 10% smaller than the average of the values reported previously for the larger 6.59 kbp isoform. The literature data are highly scattered for the smaller DNA; for example, the RG values for the 2.31 and 2.69 kbp are 104 nm (Lewis, 1986) and 151  2 nm (Seils and Dorfmuller, 1991), respectively, with the larger value for the 2.69 kbp DNA close to that determined in this work for a 5.76 kbp plasmid. The datum from Seils and Dorfmuller (1991) for the supercoiled isoform of the 2.69 kbp is also inconsistent with other results in the literature (discussed below), suggesting that there were problems with the reported RG values from that study. Corresponding results for the open-circular (Fishman and Patterson, 1996; Voordouw et al., 1978) and supercoiled (Campbell, 1976; Campbell and Eason, 1975; Campbell and Jolly, 1973; Fishman and Patterson, 1996; Hammermann et al., 1997; Jolly and Campbell, 1972; Langowski et al., 1999; Seils and Dorfmuller, 1991; Voordouw et al., 1978) isoforms are shown in the middle and bottom panels of Figure 4. There are only two prior SLS studies for the open-circular

isoform, with the RG value obtained in this work for the 5.76 kbp plasmid (130  3 nm) lying appropriately between the literature RG values for the 3.73 kbp (90  3 nm) and 6.59 kbp (134 nm) plasmids. The results for the supercoiled plasmid are all in fairly good agreement, with the single exception of the very large value of RG 1⁄4 178  2 nm reported by Seils and Dorfmuller (1991) for the 2.69 kbp
pUC19 plasmid; in contrast, Langowski et al. (1999) reported RG 1⁄4 55.5 nm for the same plasmid.
Structural Models for Radius of Gyration
A number of structural models have been used to estimate the radius of gyration of the different plasmid isoforms. The FJC model, which is based on the assumption of ideal Gaussian chain statistics, is typically used for very large DNA (chain length much greater than the persistence length). A more appropriate model for small and intermediate size DNA is the WLC model (Benoit and Doty, 1953), which accounts for both local stiffness and long-range flexibility:

3a  1 þ 2a
L 2 a
L
 2
1  exp L

(7)
where L is the DNA contour length, which can be calculated by multiplying the number of base pairs by the axial rise per base pair (0.34 nm per base pair), and a is the DNA persistence length, which is related to the DNA stiffness. The best-fit value of the persistence length was determined by fitting the experimental data for RG in the top panel of Figure 4 to Equation (7) yielding a 1⁄4 46 nm; this value is an ‘‘apparent’’ persistent length since excluded volume effects were not included in the analysis. This is in good agreement with previous estimates of the apparent persistence length reported in the literature for plasmids at similar ionic conditions (Borochov et al., 1981). All of the RG results in Figure 4 were obtained for solutions containing monovalent salts with ionic strengths between 100 and 200 mM; the radius of gyration increases at lower strengths corresponding to a larger persistence length (Borochov et al., 1981). The calculated values of the radius of gyration using the WLC model (solid curve in Fig. 4) were in good agreement with the experimental data for DNA from 2 to 10 kbp in length; the mean value of the absolute difference was about 5%. However, the model did over-predict the experimental result for the 16.8 kbp DNA by approximately 20%. A similar discrepancy was seen using the FJC model for this large plasmid. Fujii and Yamakawa (1975) extended the WLC analysis to derive an expression for the radius of gyration of a circular chain. This analysis was subsequently improved by Fishman (1994) with the final result expressed as

determined by fitting the experimental data in the middle panel of Figure 4 to Equation (8) yielding a 1⁄4 46 nm, which is identical to the value determined previously for the linear isoform. The model calculations (shown by the solid curve in Fig. 4) properly captured the dependence of RG on the size of the open-circular plasmid over the entire range of DNA sizes (3.7–16.8 kbp), with the mean value of the absolute difference between the model and data being approximately 5%. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the expression given as Equation (8) has been compared with experimental RG data for circular DNA. Zakharova et al. (2002) developed a relatively simple expression for the radius of gyration of an elongated supercoil without end loops:
RG;supercoiled 1⁄4 L2

12
 1=2
(9)
where Ls is the superhelix axis length and rs is the superhelix radius. Boles et al. (1990) reported that Ls/L 1⁄4 0.41 for a range of plasmid sizes and degrees of supercoiling based on electron microscopy measurements. Hammermann et al. (1998) evaluated rs using small angle neutron scattering with values of approximately 5 nm for ionic strengths greater than 100 mM. The calculated values of RG given by Equation (9) are shown by the dashed curve in the bottom panel of Figure 4. The model significantly overestimated the experimental data from both this study and the literature, which is consistent with previous conclusions from Prazeres (2008). An alternative approach for calculating the radius of gyration of a supercoiled plasmid is to use the expression for RG for linear DNA given by the WLC model (Equation 7) but with an ‘‘effective contour length’’ set equal to the superhelix axis length to account for the end-to-end attachment in the supercoiled plasmid. de Carmejane et al. (1999) used this approach with Ls 1⁄4 0.5 L, which is the maximum possible extension of the supercoiled DNA based on the attached ends. The resulting prediction for the radius of gyration using a 1⁄4 46 nm (based on the results for the linear and open-circular DNA) is shown by the dotted curve in the bottom panel of Figure 4. This simple model was in much better agreement with the data than Equation (9), but it still significantly over-predicted the RG values, particularly for the larger plasmids; the average absolute deviation from experimental values was 22%. A significantly improved estimate can be obtained using Ls 1⁄4 0.4 L with a 1⁄4 46 nm (solid curve in bottom panel of Fig. 4), which yielded a mean absolute deviation between the model and data of 8%. To our knowledge this is the only expression in the literature that accurately predicts the RG of supercoiled plasmid DNA. Note that Boles et al. (1990) estimated the length of supercoiled DNA from images obtained using electron microscopy as Ls/L 1⁄4 0.41, in excellent agreement with the value used to construct the solid curve in the bottom panel of Figure 4. This ratio is likely a function of solution ionic strength due to differences in branching of the twisted DNA in the supercoiled morphology.
Conclusions
Despite the extensive interest in the separation, analysis, and application of plasmid DNA, there have been relatively few direct measurements of the root mean square radius of gyration of different plasmid isoforms over a range of plasmid size. SLS data were obtained in this study for the supercoiled, open-circular, and linear isoforms of 5.76, 9.80, and 16.8 kbp plasmids. The results for the two larger plasmids are unique since the current literature only contains RG data for linear and open-circular plasmids <7 kbp in size and for supercoiled plasmids <11 kbp. The radius of gyration was determined by fitting the calculated values of the scattering form factor to appropriate theoretical expressions for linear and circular chains. The radii of gyration of the supercoiled and opencircular isoforms were then calculated from the z-average values based on the number fraction of monomers and dimers determined from the weight-average molecular weight of the sample; this correction was not needed for the linear isoforms since the enzymatic digestion eliminated the high molecular weight species (as confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis). Thus, the calculated values of the radius of gyration obtained in this study, which account for both the contribution from low levels of higher molecular weight dimers and the effect of the plasmid morphology on the scattering form factor, should provide some of the most accurate RG values currently available in the literature. Note that the plasmid conformation, and thus the effective size, is also affected by shear and elongational flow, phenomena that were beyond the scope of this study. For a given plasmid size (i.e., number of base pairs), the radius of gyration was greatest for the linear isoform followed by the open-circular and then the supercoiled isoform. The experimental results for the linear and opencircular isoforms were in fairly good agreement with calculations using the WLC model. The classic WLC model (Equation 7) with an apparent persistence length of 46 nm provided the best-fit to the RG results for the linear isoform. The same value of the persistence length fit the data for the open-circular isoform using the expression for RG given by the circular WLC model (Equation 8). A simple theoretical expression was developed for the radius of gyration of the supercoiled isoform using the WLC model for a linear chain (Equation 7) but with an effective contour length (Ls) that is a fraction of the total contour length. This analysis is consistent with the effects of circularization in combination with the tight twisting of the supercoiled DNA. The model and experimental data were in good agreement using Ls 1⁄4 0.4 L with a 1⁄4 46 nm as determined for the other plasmid isoforms. This simple expression provides accurate estimates for the radius of gyration of supercoiled DNA over a wide range of plasmid size without having to perform complex Brownian dynamics simulations.
