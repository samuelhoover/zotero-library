We report results of a systematic analysis of thermal transport in electron-irradiated, including irradiation-induced amorphous, graphene sheets based on nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations. We focus on the dependence of the thermal conductivity, k, of the irradiated graphene sheets on the inserted irradiation defect density, c, as well as the extent of defect passivation with hydrogen atoms. While the thermal conductivity of irradiated graphene decreases precipitously from that of pristine graphene, k0, upon introducing a low vacancy concentration, c < 1%, in the graphene lattice, further reduction of the thermal conductivity with the increasing vacancy concentration exhibits a weaker dependence on c until the amorphization threshold. Beyond the onset of amorphization, the dependence of thermal conductivity on the vacancy concentration becomes significantly weaker, and k practically reaches a plateau value. Throughout the range of c and at all hydrogenation levels examined, the correlation k 1⁄4 k0(1 þ ac)1 gives an excellent description of the simulation results. The value of the coefficient a captures the overall strength of the numerous phonon scattering centers in the irradiated graphene sheets, which include monovacancies, vacancy clusters, carbon ring reconstructions, disorder, and a rough nonplanar sheet morphology. Hydrogen passivation increases the value of a, but the effect becomes very minor beyond the amorphization threshold. Published by AIP Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4997772
Graphene derivatives and graphene-based metamaterials fabricated by defect engineering and chemical functionalization have unique properties toward enabling a broad range of engineering applications.1–13 Electron irradiation is particularly appealing for defect engineering because it can be used to tune the structure and properties of such graphene-based materials by precisely controlling electron energy and irradiation dose. Electron-irradiation-induced amorphization of graphene has been demonstrated experimentally,1 and computer models have been developed that reproduce the experimentally reported amorphized structures.14,15 In these models, the irradiated structures are generated by introducing into the graphene lattice random distributions of vacancies and properly relaxing the defective lattice structure. The amorphization transition occurs at an inserted vacancy concentration of 5%–10%14 and is accompanied by a brittle-toductile transition in the mechanical response.15 Defect passivation in the irradiated graphene sheets does not alter the onset of ductility.16 In pristine graphene, thermal transport is mainly limited by Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering characterized by a long phonon mean free path (775 nm),17 which results in high thermal conductivity [2000–5000 W/ (m K)].17–19 Disorder and lattice defects introduce additional phonon scattering mechanisms that affect substantially the lattice thermal conductivity of graphene. Thermal transport simulations have predicted a reduced thermal conductivity of amorphous, but otherwise sp2-bonded, graphene compared to that of pristine graphene.20,21 Substantial defect-induced reduction of the intrinsic thermal conductivity of pristine
graphene also has been demonstrated for various types of lattice imperfections, including monovacancies and divacancies, Stone-Wales (SW) defects, impurities, and nanoribbon edges.18,19,22–30 However, an understanding of the thermal transport properties of electron-irradiated graphene—with its truly representative plethora of defects—and their dependence on irradiation dose remains elusive. The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of electron irradiation on the thermal conductivity of graphene. Using molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations on structural models that represent irradiated graphene properly, we analyze thermal transport in electron-irradiated graphene sheets as a function of the irradiation dose quantified through the concentration, c, of vacancy defects introduced into the sheets upon irradiation. We also explore the effects of passivation with H atoms of the dangling bonds of undercoordinated C atoms generated by the irradiation. We find that throughout the range of c and for every extent of passivation examined, the c dependence of the thermal conductivity of the irradiated sheets obeys a universal functional form involving a single coefficient that expresses the effect of the phonon scattering mechanisms on the conductivity reduction with increasing c. Interestingly, our results also indicate that the irradiation-induced amorphization threshold is correlated with a change in the dominant thermal transport mechanism in the irradiated sheets. Thermal transport in irradiated and hydrogen-passivated irradiated graphene is analyzed based on M€uller-Plathe nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics (NEMD) simulations,31 implemented using the LAMMPS software package,32 with the interatomic interactions described according to the adaptive interatomic reactive bond order (AIREBO) potential.33

After proper structural relaxation (detailed below for irradiated samples) at 300 K and zero pressure, the graphene sheets were equilibrated further in the microcanonical ensemble (at constant volume and energy). Subsequently, a constant heat flux was imposed by adding/subtracting heat in the hot/cold regions of the supercell at the same rate (6.4  108 W). A schematic representation of the supercell employed in our NEMD simulation procedure is shown on top of Fig. 1(a). Under the imposed heat flow, the temperature field in the graphene sheets reaches a steady state within 2 ns. The simulations are then carried out for several more ns for averaging and data collection. In the steady state, a constant temperature gradient is established along the heat flux direction, which is used to calculate the thermal conductivity of the graphene sheet according to Fourier’s law of heat conduction, J 1⁄4 –krT, where J is the heat flux, k is the thermal conductivity tensor of the material, and rT is the thermal gradient. For isotropic heat conduction, k is reduced to a scalar quantity, and for a one-dimensional heat flux, rT is reduced to dT/dx. Figure 1(a) shows a representative steadystate temperature profile along the heat flux direction, x, for a graphene supercell of length L 1⁄4 40 nm along x. In all of our simulations, the width of the graphene sheet supercell was fixed to 5 nm, as determined by systematic convergence tests. In the dilute defect limit (low c), for computational tractability due to the long phonon mean
free path, we implemented a scaling procedure for the dependence of k on L,34 with L ranging up to 400 nm: this is shown in Fig. 1(b) where 1/k is plotted as a function of 1/L and the bulk thermal conductivity k is derived by linear extrapolation to the 1/L ! 0 limit. For pristine graphene, we find the bulk thermal conductivity to be 482 6 31 W/ (m K) and 470 6 25 W/(m K) for heat flow along the zigzag (ZZ) and armchair (AC) directions, respectively, in agreement with a recent study employing the same interatomic potential.35 These results imply isotropic heat conduction in our graphene sheets. The irradiated graphene samples were generated by introducing into the graphene supercell random distributions of vacancies, at a given concentration c, and performing a very systematic structural relaxation scheme by implementing a variant of simulated annealing. Specifically, following a conjugate-gradient local energy minimization, the samples were equilibrated by MD simulation for 100 ps at 1900 K and zero pressure using a Nose-Hoover thermostat and barostat with a simulation time step of 0.2 fs. Subsequently, a cooling schedule was executed with cooling stages (from 1900 to 300 K) at 200 K apart from each other and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of thermal annealing was conducted for an order of 105 MC sweeps at each stage employing a time-stamped force-biased MC (tfMC) algorithm,36 implemented in LAMMPS.37,38 Further equilibration by MD at 300 K and zero pressure for another 500 ps prior to equilibration in the microcanonical ensemble for 100 ps was used to prepare the materials for NEMD simulation as described above. Representative configurations of structurally relaxed, irradiated graphene sheets generated through this method are shown in Fig. 2(b1–b8) for inserted vacancy concentrations ranging from 2% to 16%. Consistent with our previous studies,14–16 as well as experimental observations,1 these irradiated sheets retain their coherent 2D structure; however, their morphology is non-planar characterized by wrinkles and roughness that increases with the increasing vacancy concentration. After the steady state was reached (within 2 ns), spatial and time averaging was performed for another 2–4 ns to obtain the resulting constant temperature gradient and the corresponding thermal conductivity. For crystalline graphene sheets at c levels below the amorphization threshold, the (bulk) conductivity values k reported here are well converged with the supercell length L. For amorphized sheets, supercells with L 1⁄4 20 nm are sufficiently long for accurate k computations. All the thermal conductivity results reported here are average values over 10 different NEMD runs, for 5 different irradiated samples (i.e., different initial random vacancy distributions at given c) with the heat flow imposed along two different (ZZ and AC) directions. Figure 2(a) shows our simulation results for the dependence on the inserted vacancy concentration c of the thermal conductivity k of the irradiated graphene sheets. It is evident from Fig. 2(a) that k is reduced dramatically upon introduction of a dilute vacancy population, at low c, with the k(c) dependence becoming significantly weaker at higher c levels. Throughout the inserted vacancy concentration range examined, an excellent description of the simulation results is given by the equation

where k0 is the (bulk) thermal conductivity of pristine graphene and ai represents a “thermal conductivity reduction” coefficient; i 1⁄4 0 denotes unpassivated irradiated graphene. Equation (1) provides an excellent optimal fitting of the simulation results [see red dashed line in Fig. 2(a)] with a fitting parameter value of a0 1⁄4 6.311 for c expressed in percent. Equation (1) implies that the value of k drops to half of that of k0 at c  0.15% and to less than 2% of k0 at the amorphization threshold. The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows a magnification of the main plot for c > 1%. The two dashed lines represent optimal linear fits of the k(c) results below and above the amorphization threshold or linearizations of Eq. (1) over the corresponding c ranges. The dramatically different slopes of the two lines, (dk/dc)crystalline  (dk/dc)amorphous, imply that the order-to-disorder structural transition is accompanied by a transition in the dominant thermal transport mechanism. It should be mentioned that the k(c) correlation of Eq. (1) is a practically equivalent functional form with correlations reported in computational studies of thermal transport in graphene sheets with isolated monovacancies (mv) and Stone-Wales (SW) defects at low concentrations;25 in the
context of Eq. (1), aSW < amv < a0 1⁄4 6.311. We conclude that Eq. (1) provides a universal expression for the defectinduced deterioration of thermal conductivity in graphene. The reason why the k reduction coefficient a0 is highest in our samples is the structure of our graphene sheets, which contain larger voids (mv clusters) as well as carbon ring reconstructions, resulting in networks of random polygons surrounding these voids at high c, i.e., a broader class of structurally relaxed lattice defects acting as stronger centers of phonon scattering. Moreover, the rough nonplanar morphology of our sheets at higher c as well as the structural disorder above the amorphization threshold, Fig. 2(b5–b8), also contributes to phonon scattering, resulting in delocalization of the scattering centers and reduction of the phonon mean free path, thus facilitating a transition in the dominant thermal transport mechanism25,39,40 from propagating to diffusive with increasing c. To understand the effects of defect passivation on the thermal conductivity of irradiated graphene, we have performed NEMD simulations of thermal transport on hydrogenated irradiated graphene sheets, prepared as described in Ref. 16, with the dangling bonds of the undercoordinated C atoms passivated with H atoms.16 Two levels of hydrogenation were used, resulting in hydrogenated C atoms with dangling bonds that are either partially or fully H-passivated;16 undercoordinated C atoms partially passivated with one H atom each remain sp2-hybridized, while those fully passivated with two H atoms become sp3-hybridized. Representative configurations of a defective region with partially and fully Hpassivated C atoms that were undercoordinated upon irradiation are depicted in Fig. 3(b). Figure 3(a) shows NEMD simulation results for the k(c) dependence of partially and fully Hpassivated irradiated graphene sheets and compares them with those of pristine (unpassivated) irradiated graphene. The results of Fig. 3(a) indicate that, below the amorphization threshold, partial H passivation reduces the thermal conductivity of the irradiated graphene further but very slightly, while full H passivation is responsible for a small further reduction of the thermal conductivity. However, this passivation effect on k(c) becomes very weak at higher c, above the amorphization threshold. At each level of hydrogenation, Eq. (1) provides an excellent description of the k(c) results, as shown by its excellent fitting of the NEMD data in the inset in Fig. 3(a) in all cases throughout the range of c examined. The corresponding k reduction coefficients ai, i 1⁄4 1 and 2 for partial and full H passivation, respectively, are a1 1⁄4 6.978 and a2 1⁄4 7.733, i.e., a2 > a1 > a0. We attribute the increase of the a coefficient with full H passivation to the sp2 ! sp3 hybridization transition of the hydrogenated C atoms and the bond stretching and twisting induced by this transition,16 which renders the fully passivated defects stronger centers for phonon scattering. Nevertheless, above the amorphization threshold, such defect passivation has only a very minor effect on the reduction of the phonon mean free path. We also hypothesize that passivation with agents more massive than H atoms may further increase the corresponding a coefficients by affecting relevant material properties such as the speed of sound in the irradiated graphene sheets. In summary, we have conducted a systematic analysis of thermal transport in electron-irradiated graphene sheets

based on NEMD simulations with emphasis on the thermal conductivity dependence on the inserted defect density upon irradiation. We have found a dramatic reduction of the thermal conductivity from that of pristine graphene in the dilute defect limit, with a weaker defect concentration dependence at higher concentrations in the crystalline structure. Beyond the amorphization threshold, the thermal conductivity of the irradiated graphene sheets practically saturates with increasing defect density. Our results indicate that there is a transition in the dominant thermal transport mechanism from propagating to diffusive accompanying the crystalline-toamorphous transition in irradiated graphene. We also find that hydrogenation has a weak effect on the thermal conductivity of the irradiated graphene sheets, as the thermal conductivity is reduced slightly, notably when the hydrogenated C atoms become sp3-hybridized and the sheet structure remains crystalline. However, beyond the amorphization threshold, defect passivation by hydrogenation does not have any detectable effect on the thermal conductivity of irradiated graphene. Throughout the defect concentration range examined and at every hydrogenation level, an excellent description of the NEMD simulation results is given by Eq. (1), which provides a universal correlation for the thermal
conductivity of irradiated graphene sheets as a function of inserted defect concentration upon irradiation. Our results indicate that the combination of defect engineering and chemical functionalization could be used very effectively to tailor the thermal transport properties of graphene for thermal management applications. The precise tuning of a diminishing thermal conductivity by controlling the defect population through the electron irradiation dose is particularly promising toward future thermoelectric engineering of graphene-based metamaterials.
