Available online 10 August 2016 The coacervation of systems containing colloids (e.g. proteins or micelles) and polyelectrolytes (notably ionic polysaccharides) is often accompanied by precipitation. This can introduce inhomogeneity, irreversibility and irreproducible kinetics in applications in food science and bioengineering, with negative impact on texture and stability of food products, and unpredictable delivery of active “payloads.” The relationship between coacervation and precipitation is obscure in that coacervates might be intermediates in the formation of precipitates, or else the two phenomena might proceed by different but possibly simultaneous mechanisms. This review will summarize the recent literature on coacervation/precipitation in protein-polyelectrolyte systems for which reports are most abundant, particularly in the context of food science. We present current findings and opinions about the relationship between the two types of phase separation. Results vary considerably depending not only on the protein-polyelectrolyte pairs chosen, but also on conditions including macromolecular concentrations and ionic strength. Nevertheless, we offer some general approaches that could explain a variety of observations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Polyelectrolyte–protein (PE-pr) complexes can undergo phase separations when suitable conditions are satisfied, primarily due to electrostatic interactions and entropic effects [1]. These phase separations can be liquid-liquid (coacervate) or liquid-solid (precipitate) depending on the strength of the interaction. The fact that proteins usually keep their structure and function intact under either type of separation has led to a growing interest for in vitro and in vivo applications, including drug delivery [2], protein purification [3], biomaterials [4], tissue engineering [5], and food science [6]. An understanding of PE-pr complexes is also relevant to biological
processes, involving e.g. heparin-binding proteins. In all of these circumstances, differentiation between “coacervation” and “precipitation” is important, but is often obscured by terminology or by ambiguous results, including a failure to distinguish between a dense liquid phase (coacervate) and a solid phase (precipitate), or even their coexistence. The intention of this review is to describe the identification of these two phenomena, and to generalize about their possible causes. Coacervation and precipitation in PE-protein systems, arise when the electrostatic interaction between the two macroions attains a level that enhances proximity between the respective charge sites, often leading to abrupt expulsion of counterions and water. Proteins can also exhibit heteroprotein coacervation, and PE pairs exhibit both coacervation and precipitation [7,8]. Fixed size and shape of proteins severely limits the range of meaningful complexes resulting in highly restricted conditions for coacervation and virtually eliminates

precipitation. The comparably vast array of PE configurations facilitates the formation of numerous states including coacervate and precipitate. PE-colloid systems following Eq. (1) occupy an intermediate position, exhibiting well-defined transitions over a limited range of conditions. With regard to the strong sensitivity to small changes in conditions, they resemble the initiation of complex formation which also resembles a phase change vide infra. While changes in ionic strength in principle could lead to such transitions, pH is by far the most important way to alter interactions in systems with proteins because transitions occur over very small changes in pH, then identified with “critical” pH values: namely as pHc for the onset of complex formation, pHφ for the onset of liquid-liquid phase separation (coacervation), and often a subsequent pH for coacervate dissolution (see for example, Fig. 1) [9]. This terminology essentially derives from the identification of related transitions in polyelectrolyte-micelle systems [10,11], which, because of the isotropy of micelle charge and shape, is more readily related to theoretical predictions of critical conditions for adsorption of polyelectrolytes on oppositely charged surface [12,13], viz. Eq. (1).
σcξ  κa ð1Þ
where σc, the surface charge density of the colloid, is proportional to Y, the fraction of micellar surfactant head groups that are charged; κ is reciprocal Debye length, inversely proportional to ionic strength; and ξ is the dimensionless polyelectrolyte linear charge density. Note that Eq. (1) describes a cooperative transition not subject to mass-action, so that Yc, the experimental analogue of σc, does not depend on polyelectrolyte or colloid concentration. Similarly, pHc as a local phenomenon depends only on ionic strength, not protein-PE stoichiometry r, or PE Mw [14], pHφ is responsive to interactions on length scales beyond the size of those complexes which is feasible when complexes approach neutrality, and is broadened over a range of pH only due to system polydispersity or disproportionation [15]. While pHc depends only on I, pHφ depends also on PE:protein stoichiometry. However, the overall concentration of colloid at fixed I and r has little effect – e.g. coacervates cannot be diluted away. It is noteworthy that characterization of interpolymer complexation at the sub-micron scale yielding critical conditions for PE-PE complexation is an emerging approach (Schatz et al. submitted for publication). While the ability to distinguish between liquid-liquid and liquidsolid phase transitions might be considered trivial, techniques such as turbidimetry are often inadequate, especially when the two phases coexist. Consequently, the terms “coacervation” and “precipitation” are sometimes used almost interchangeably, although the two phenomena
differ in several important ways, and can be distinguished by bright field microscopy as shown in Fig. 2 which readily distinguishes spherical fluids from irregular solids in the μm range [16,17]. Coacervation as a liquid-liquid phase transition reflects a reversible equilibrium, while precipitation, kinetically controlled, can be essentially irreversible, a consequence of tight binding and water expulsion. Evidence from the related system of polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged mixed micelles strongly suggests that precipitation and coacervation follow different mechanisms, with opposite dependences on salt concentration and polymer MW [18]. Turbidity is the most convenient measure of changes in solution or suspension, but fails to distinguish coacervate from precipitate, and in fact cannot alone identify co-existing mixtures of coacervate and precipitate, even when obvious to the viewer or the camera. A representative number of publications (Table 1), which report coacervation, precipitation, or both, in both food and non-food systems is shown in Table 1. While little seems to have been said about the relationship between coacervation and precipitation in such studies, we offer plausible explanations about causality and mechanisms.
2. Annealed systems
The majority of the systems in Table 1 include polymers of natural origin, such as pectin, gum Arabic and alginic acid. These “weak” or “annealed” polyanions, used in foods together with e.g. βlactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin and whey protein, comprise a dominant source of information about protein-PE coacervation, either with or without precipitation. A key property of such systems is the diminution of the negative charge density of PE (degree of dissociation, α) in the pH range in which protein charge Zpr is becoming more positive. This is in contrast to systems with “strong” or “quenched” (pH-independent) PE's, encountered in the field of protein purification by precipitation [19] or various fundamental studies [1]. The inverse pH-dependence of the magnitudes of Zpr and α accounts for the tendency of coacervates to form and then redissolve, resulting in turbidity maxima with change in pH, behavior not observed with proteins and quenched PE's. A frequently observed but rarely interpreted effect is the pH corresponding to maximum turbidity, usually designated as pHopt [20–23], referred to by us as pHτ⁎ [24]. As shown in Fig. 1 and also in Refs. [24] and [27], the turbidity dependence on pH is highly asymmetric in this region. This indicates a transition from one phase state to another. When coacervate is the only dense phase observed, as is the case for BLG/pectin in Ref. [25], the symmetry of turbidity change on both sides of pHopt, likely reflects a similar effect of pH on the magnitude of complex net charge on both sides of pHopt. There is strong evidence that pHopt corresponds to complex electroneutrality [21]. Thus strong asymmetry indicates that something other than charge neutrality is at play below pHopt, supported by observations for e.g. hyaluronic acid and BLG which clearly show precipitation at that pH [24]. Hence, asymmetric turbidity maxima at “pHopt”, suggest that precipitation instead of redissolution follows maximum turbidity. Precipitation reflects a strong local electrostatic interaction between the PE chain and a local protein region of opposite charge, normally a consequence of low polyanion pKa such that PE charge (ZPE) is well-retained as proteins become more positive and attain strong PE-binding domains at pH b pI, especially in the form of a protein “positive patch”. Strong increases in n (the number of proteins bound per polymer chain) enhances the sensitivity of net complex charge ZT to pH at pH b pI where nZpr changes sign, according to Eq. (2):
ZT 1⁄4 ZPE−nZpr ð2Þ
In other words, pHopt represents the condition at which the effect of pH on the local protein-PE interaction becomes more significant than the effect of pH on complex net neutrality, and coacervate dissolution expected at ZT N 0, is replaced with or obscured by precipitation.

The balance between the effect of pH on complex net charge near ZT = 0 vs. its effect on the strength of the PE-protein interaction depends on the relative effects of pH on (1) PE degree of dissociation α, and (2) net protein charge Zpr, as shown in Fig. 3. The effects of changes in α and Zpr are as we will see, subject to the influence of PE blockiness and protein charge anisotropy, respectively. This is the case for BLG and hyaluronic acid with pKa = 2.9, such that α is close to 1 at complex charge neutrality, pHopt = 4.4 [24]. Attempts to move away from neutrality by lowering pH and thus destabilize coacervate, do not reduce α much for such PE's with low pKa (which behave like quenched PE's at pH N N pKa) but the drop in pH does increase +Z, making local binding stronger. Similar examples are carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)/potato proteins [26], and bovine serum albumin (BSA)/polyacrylic acid (PAA) [27]. This increase in + Zpr large compared to the decrease in α (Fig. 3), causes the complex to become more positively charged. While this could by itself cause coacervate dissolution, the predominant effect of an increase in the positive protein charge when α is large is stronger binding affinity and precipitation. The opposite behavior, redissolution in place of precipitation is seen when HA is replaced by pectin (3.5 b pKa b 4.5) [25]. Because of the lower acidity of pectin, the point of complex electroneutrality is observed at higher pH, 3 b pHopt b 5, and the difference between pKa and pHopt is less than the difference found for BLG-HA. Because α diminishes significantly upon addition of acid at pHopt, complex net charge becomes positive and protein-PE interactions diminish, thus favoring
coacervate dissolution vs. precipitation. Similar behavior is seen when BLG is replaced by ovalbumin [23]. While Fig. 3 can be applied to all systems of proteins with annealed polymers, its utility is limited by two considerations. First, α fails to describe the effective PE charge, i.e. the electrostatic potential of the PE as “experienced” by the protein, and this is influenced by PE structural linear charge density (e.g. hyaluronic acid vs. alginate) and blockiness (as in pectin), as well as steric effects such as PE branching (as in gum Arabic). Second, Zpr does not represent the electrostatic domain of the protein as “experienced” by the PE; thus net protein charge does not explain binding on the “wrong side of pI”, requiring consideration of protein charge anisotropy [28]. For example, the separation in pH units between pHc and pHp for HA with BLG (Fig. 4) is pHc − pHp = 1.6 (6.1–4.5) [24], whereas the comparable result for HA with mAb is pHc − pHp = 2.5 (7.5–5.0) [29]. The higher pI of mAb (9.6 vs. 5.2) explains why this protein exhibits higher pHc but does not explain why more extensive diminution in pH is required to progress from the onset of binding to the point of precipitation; this corresponds to a much larger increase in protein net charge for mAb vs. BLG at precipitation (ZpmrAb = + 50 vs. ZpBrLG = + 9, respectively). This does not simply arise from the larger size of mAb, since charge per unit surface area at pHp is actually higher for mAb. This difference can be explained by protein charge anisotropy: basic amino acids, highly dispersed in mAb, are more localized in BLG, exhibiting a positive “patch” even at pH N pI [3]. The point of precipitation occurs when the

interaction of this positive domain with polyanion becomes large enough to expel counterions and hence water. In addition to variability in pKa, polysaccharide affinity for proteins is modulated by two important structural features: the presence of branches, and the average spacing between carboxyl groups (Fig. 5) (structural charge density) which itself may be nonuniform along the polymer chain, as for pectin (see below). Diminution of interaction strength and coacervate dissolution is seen below pHopt (3–3.75) for ovalbumin with gum Arabic system; the effect of the high acidity of GA (pKa ~2.0) is opposed by its complex branching [22]. The “blockiness” of pectin, arising from post-translational enzymatic de-esterification (e-methylation) influences protein affinity because proteins bind preferentially to regions of high charge [30,31]. This should enhance protein affinity, but can be counterbalanced by the relatively high value of pKa ~4.5. The weak acidity of pectin promotes charge neutralization and redissolution, but also opposes tight binding, and coacervation is reversed below pHopt which is observed over a broad region of 3 b pH b 5 [25]. The high local linear charge density of pectin however makes protein-PE association more resistant to salt, complexes forming at high ionic strength for blockier pectin. Pectins
with high degrees of local charge density can complex with BLG at higher ionic strengths compared to pectins with the same degrees of methylation, but having lower local charge density. On the other hand, it has been proposed that high degrees of methylation and random charge distribution promote precipitate formation due to BLG cluster formation within complexes [32].
3. Quenched systems
Protein-PE precipitation is most frequently reported for quenched polyelectrolytes for which pH affects only protein charge, different from the high-pKa annealed polysaccharides subject to charge loss at low pH, noted above. Examples include polyvinyl sulfonic acid (PVS) with lysozyme [33], trypsin [34], and chymotrypsin [19].

systems [35,36] may be related to lower charge density for that polycation.
4. General observations
Coacervation and precipitation both arise from desolvation, driven by or at least coupled with the release of counterions. These small ions in turn are displaced by macromolecules e.g. polyelectrolytes of the same charge, as they come to reside closer to the protein surface. Along with the entropy of small ion release, the approach of the two macroions is exenthalpic due to charge proximity, i.e. the overlapping potential fields of protein and PE. The stronger these fields and the greater the overlap, the greater the degree of desolvation, promoting precipitation vs. coacervation. Since both protein charge and PE charge contribute to the magnitude of this effect, an attractive goal would be to resolve the nature of phase separation into contributions from the two and observe which one is dominant. The electrostatic inter-macromolecular interaction is controlled by the effective “surface” charge densities of the protein and the linear charge density of the PE, the magnitudes of which change in opposite direction with pH, and these could be related to protein pI and PE pKa as in Fig. 3. Discerning this relationship from the results in Table 1 would be a daunting task, since other significant parameters such as ionic strength, and protein:PE stoichiometry vary widely. The necessary experiments in which systematic changes in PE charge density and flexibility are made for a given protein at fixed ionic strength and protein:PE stoichiometry are not readily found in Table 1.
5. Conclusions and outlook
pH-dependent liquid-liquid and liquid-solid phase separations (coacervation and precipitation, respectively) are frequently noted in the literature on protein-polyelectrolyte (PE) systems. Both result from an increase in protein-PE electrostatic interactions, but the magnitude of protein (+) and polysaccharide (−) charges typically vary in opposite directions upon decrease in pH. Below the pH of complex charge neutrality, at or near “pHopt”, either precipitation or redissolution of coacervate will occur depending on the strength of the protein-PE interaction at this pH. The resultant phase separation is then affected by the pKa of polyelectrolyte: If pKa is small compared to pHopt, the degree of ionization of the PE α is large at this condition. “Annealed” (pH-dependent) polyanions with low pKa behave like “quenched” (pH-independent) PE's near “pHopt”, with α relatively insensitive to pH and close to unity. Lowering pH does however increase the positive magnitude of Zpr, intensifying local binding, thus leading to precipitation. On the other hand, if pKa is close to pHopt, a decrease in α with decreasing pH compensates for the effect of increase in Z (+), and binding affinity is not increased. The charge of the complex moves from neutrality without intensified binding, and coacervate can redissolve without precipitation. The effects of α and Z are influenced by PE blockiness (as for regions of demethylation in pectin) and protein charge anisotropy (e.g. positive domain of BLG). The former can affect protein affinity; therefore, deviations from the expected effect of α are seen i.e. precipitate formation when PE mean charge density is low. Protein charge anisotropy leads to a similar effect, i.e. precipitate formation when the net charge of protein is small. Further understanding of these effects require systematic exploration of selected variables such as PE linear charge density and chain stiffness, ionic strength and protein-PE stoichiometry, the last affecting complex charge neutrality but not intrinsic protein-PE binding affinity.
