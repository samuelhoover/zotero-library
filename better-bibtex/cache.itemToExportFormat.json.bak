The enthalpy of polyelectrolyte complexation is quantified by comparisons of the Coulomb energy before and after complexation. The entropy of polyelectrolyte complexation is determined directly from simulations and compared with that from a mean-field lattice model explicitly accounting for counterion adsorption. At weak Coulomb interaction strengths, e.g., in solvents of high dielectric constant or with weakly charged polyelectrolytes, complexation is driven by a negative enthalpy due to electrostatic attraction between two oppositely charged chains, with counterion release entropy playing only a subsidiary role. In the strong interaction regime, complexation is driven by a large counterion release entropy and opposed by a positive enthalpy change. The addition of salt reduces the enthalpy of polyelectrolyte complexation by screening electrostatic interaction at all Coulomb interaction strengths. The counterion release entropy also decreases in the presence of salt, but the reduction only becomes significant at higher Coulomb interaction strengths. More significantly, in the range of Coulomb interaction strengths appropriate for highly charged polymers in aqueous solutions, complexation enthalpy depends weakly on salt concentration and counterion release entropy exhibits a large variation as a function of salt concentration. Our study quantitatively establishes that polyelectrolyte complexation in highly charged Coulomb systems is of entropic origin. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.","date":"2006","extra":"PMID: 16674260","volume":"124","pages":"1-11","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.2178803","issue":"15","journalAbbreviation":"J Chem Phys","ISSN":"00219606","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Ou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Muthukumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-30T20:17:12Z","dateModified":"2024-05-09T20:39:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/TAGMQUBE","itemID":750,"attachments":[{"key":"PA9XJI4U","version":7482,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ou_muthukumar-2006-entropy_and_enthalpy_of_polyelectrolyte_complexation.pdf","parentItem":"TAGMQUBE","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/J Chem Phys/ou_muthukumar-2006-entropy_and_enthalpy_of_polyelectrolyte_complexation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:17:41Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/PA9XJI4U","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/J Chem Phys/ou_muthukumar-2006-entropy_and_enthalpy_of_polyelectrolyte_complexation.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4984/ou_muthukumar-2006-entropy_and_enthalpy_of_polyelectrolyte_complexation.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084203,"version":0},"$loki":1711},{"itemID":1149,"item":{"key":"8NQSKGRD","version":8930,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"50th Anniversary Perspective : A Perspective on Polyelectrolyte Solutions","abstractNote":"From the beginning of life with the information-containing polymers until the present era of a plethora of water-based materials in health care industry and biotechnology, polyelectrolytes are ubiquitous with a broad range of structural and functional properties. The main attribute of polyelectrolyte solutions is that all molecules are strongly correlated both topologically and electrostatically in their neutralizing background of charged ions in highly polarizable solvent. These strong correlations and the necessary use of numerous variables in experiments on polyelectrolytes have presented immense challenges toward fundamental understanding of the various behaviors of charged polymeric systems.

Phase separation and complex coacervation of polypeptides are investigated in this study. Polypeptides have identical backbones and differ only in their charged side groups, making them attractive model systems for this work. All experiments are conducted using equal chain lengths of polycation and polyanion in order to isolate and highlight effects of the interactions of the charged groups during complexation. Complex coacervation is strongly affected by the polypeptide mixing ratio (stoichiometry), ionic strength (salt concentration), total polymer concentration, pH, and temperature. To examine the effect of these parameters on complex formation we use sample turbidity as an indicator, and optical microscopy to discriminate between coacervate and precipitate. We establish phase diagrams as a function of polybase content and salt concentration using the critical salt concentrations required to reach the coacervate to solution boundary. Additionally, we examine the effect of molecular weight on the complex formation for the P(L-Lysine) (PLys)/P(L-Glutamic acid) (PGlu) system and establish a phase diagram. By determining the water content of the coacervate phase under various conditions we find that the salt content and stoichiometry of the mixed polyelectrolytes have a significant effect on the coacervate composition.","date":"2012","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"pubs.rsc.org","url":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2012/sm/c2sm25604e","accessDate":"2021-11-01T22:36:54Z","extra":"Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry","volume":"8","pages":"9396-9405","publicationTitle":"Soft Matter","DOI":"10.1039/C2SM25604E","issue":"36","journalAbbreviation":"Soft Matter","ISSN":"1744-6848","creators":[{"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Priftis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tirrell","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/RPA56K4Y"]},"dateAdded":"2021-11-01T22:36:54Z","dateModified":"2022-05-24T16:12:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/RPB6JPPZ","itemID":1984,"attachments":[{"key":"3KWKH6C5","version":7146,"itemType":"attachment","title":"priftis_tirrell-2012-phase_behaviour_and_complex_coacervation_of_aqueous_polypeptide_solutions.pdf","parentItem":"RPB6JPPZ","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Soft Matter/priftis_tirrell-2012-phase_behaviour_and_complex_coacervation_of_aqueous_polypeptide_solutions.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:31:22Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/3KWKH6C5","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Soft Matter/priftis_tirrell-2012-phase_behaviour_and_complex_coacervation_of_aqueous_polypeptide_solutions.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5271/priftis_tirrell-2012-phase_behaviour_and_complex_coacervation_of_aqueous_polypeptide_solutions.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084206,"version":0},"$loki":1715},{"itemID":2084,"item":{"key":"B7ZCBAQ7","version":10615,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Charge regularization in phase separating polyelectrolyte solutions","abstractNote":"Theoretical investigations of phase separation in polyelectrolyte solutions have so far assumed that the effective charge of the polyelectrolyte chains is fixed.

By considering salt-free polyelectrolyte solutions, we show that the daughter phases have different polymer charges from that of the mother phase.

Theoretical predictions of the effects of pH and salt concentration are compared with published experimental data and experiments we performed, on systems containing poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as the polyacid and poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) or poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) as the polybase. In general, the critical salt concentration below which the mixture phase separates, increases with degree of ionization and with the hydrophobicity of polyelectrolytes. We find experimentally that as the pH is decreased below 7, and PAA monomers are neutralized, the critical salt concentration increases, while the reverse occurs when pH is raised above 7. We predict this asymmetry theoretically by introducing a large positive Flory parameter (= 0.75) for the interaction of neutral PAA monomers with water. This large positive Flory parameter is supported by molecular dynamics simulations, which show much weaker hydrogen bonding between neutral PAA and water than between charged PAA and water, while neutral and charged PDMAEMA show similar numbers of hydrogen bonds. This increased hydrophobicity of neutral PAA at reduced pH increases the tendency towards phase separation despite the reduction in charge interactions between the polyelectrolytes. Water content and volume of coacervate are found to be a strong function of the pH and salt concentration.","date":"2014","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/6/5/1414","accessDate":"2022-03-28T18:35:19Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 5\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"6","pages":"1414-1436","publicationTitle":"Polymers","DOI":"10.3390/polym6051414","issue":"5","ISSN":"2073-4360","creators":[{"firstName":"Prateek K.","lastName":"Jha","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Priyanka S.","lastName":"Desai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jingyi","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronald G.","lastName":"Larson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"associative phase separation","type":1},{"tag":"charge regulation","type":1},{"tag":"coacervation","type":1},{"tag":"complexation","type":1},{"tag":"polyelectrolyte complexes","type":1},{"tag":"precipitation","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-03-28T18:35:19Z","dateModified":"2022-03-28T18:35:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/ZE7CALRP","itemID":2146,"attachments":[{"key":"EB57VAU3","version":7083,"itemType":"attachment","title":"jha_et_al-2014-ph_and_salt_effects_on_the_associative_phase_separation_of_oppositely_charged.pdf","parentItem":"ZE7CALRP","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Polymers/jha_et_al-2014-ph_and_salt_effects_on_the_associative_phase_separation_of_oppositely_charged.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:30:47Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:09:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/EB57VAU3","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Polymers/jha_et_al-2014-ph_and_salt_effects_on_the_associative_phase_separation_of_oppositely_charged.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5259/jha_et_al-2014-ph_and_salt_effects_on_the_associative_phase_separation_of_oppositely_charged.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084209,"version":0},"$loki":1719},{"itemID":2152,"item":{"key":"3SU5NN6M","version":8930,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Dielectric constant of water from 0° to 100° C","abstractNote":"An equal ratio arm, capacitance-conductance bridge, operated at frequencies below 100 kilocycles per second, was med to measure the dielectric constant of water with an accuracy of better than 0.1 percent at 5-degree intervals over the range 0° to 100° C.

Our model describes a mixture composed of water and macromolecules that exist in three different charge states and have a tendency to phase separate. This phase separation is affected by pH via a set of chemical reactions describing protonation and deprotonation of macromolecules, as well as self-ionization of water. We consider the simple case in which interactions are captured by Flory-Huggins interaction parameters corresponding to Debye screening lengths shorter than a nanometer, which is relevant to proteins inside biological cells under physiological conditions. We identify the conjugate thermodynamic variables at chemical equilibrium and discuss the effective free energy at fixed pH. First, we study phase diagrams as a function of macromolecule concentration and temperature at the isoelectric point of the macromolecules. We find a rich variety of phase diagram topologies, including multiple critical points, triple points, and first-order transition points. Second, we change the pH relative to the isoelectric point of the macromolecules and study how phase diagrams depend on pH. We find that these phase diagrams as a function of pH strongly depend on whether oppositely charged macromolecules or neutral macromolecules have a stronger tendency to phase separate. One key finding is that we predict the existence of a reentrant behavior as a function of pH. In addition, our model predicts that the region of phase separation is typically broader at the isoelectric point. This model could account for both in vitro phase separation of proteins as a function of pH and protein phase separation in yeast cells for pH values close to the isoelectric point of many cytosolic proteins.","date":"2020-10-20","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349520307165","accessDate":"2022-07-08T16:37:19Z","volume":"119","pages":"1590-1605","publicationTitle":"Biophysical Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.bpj.2020.07.044","issue":"8","journalAbbreviation":"Biophysical Journal","ISSN":"0006-3495","creators":[{"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Adame-Arana","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christoph A.","lastName":"Weber","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vasily","lastName":"Zaburdaev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Prost","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Jülicher","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-08T16:37:19Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:58:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/9YJ9GKNG","itemID":2496,"attachments":[{"key":"4KDUMZW6","version":7051,"itemType":"attachment","title":"adame-arana_et_al-2020-liquid_phase_separation_controlled_by_ph.pdf","parentItem":"9YJ9GKNG","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Biophysical Journal/adame-arana_et_al-2020-liquid_phase_separation_controlled_by_ph.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

This property is critical for the formation and dynamics of cellular ribonucleoprotein granules, the crucibles of RNA metabolism and homeostasis.

Furthermore, to enhance specificity and transfection efficiency, polyelectrolyte complex micelles can be modified to include targeting capabilities. Here, we describe the design of targeted polyelectrolyte complex micelles containing inhibitors against dys-regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) that promote atherosclerosis, a leading cause of human mortality and morbidity. Inhibition of dys-regulated miRNAs in diseased cells associated with atherosclerosis has resulted in therapeutic efficacy in animal models and has been proposed to treat human diseases. However, the non-specific targeting of microRNA inhibitors via systemic delivery has remained an issue that may cause unwanted side effects. For this reason, we incorporated two different peptide sequences to our miRNA inhibitor containing polyelectrolyte complex micelles. One of the peptides (Arginine-Glutamic Acid-Lysine-Alanine or REKA) was used in another micellar system that demonstrated lesion-specific targeting in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. The other peptide (Valine-Histidine-Proline-Lysine-Glutamine-Histidine-Arginine or VHPKQHR) was identified via phage display and targets vascular endothelial cells through the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). In this study we have tested the in vitro efficacy and efficiency of lesion- and cell-specific delivery of microRNA inhibitors to the cells associated with atherosclerotic lesions via peptide-targeted polyelectrolyte complex micelles. Our results show that REKA-containing micelles (fibrin-targeting) and VHPKQHR-containing micelles (VCAM-1 targeting) can be used to carry and deliver microRNA inhibitors into macrophages and human endothelial cells, respectively. Additionally, the functionality of miRNA inhibitors in cells was demonstrated by analyzing miRNA expression as well as the expression or the biological function of its downstream target protein.

The number of immunotherapy drug approvals has been increasing, with numerous treatments in clinical and preclinical development. However, a key challenge in the broad implementation of immunotherapies for cancer remains the controlled modulation of the immune system, as these therapeutics have serious adverse effects including autoimmunity and nonspecific inflammation. Understanding how to increase the response rates to various classes of immunotherapy is key to improving efficacy and controlling these adverse effects. Advanced biomaterials and drug delivery systems, such as nanoparticles and the use of T cells to deliver therapies, could effectively harness immunotherapies and improve their potency while reducing toxic side effects. Here, we discuss these research advances, as well as the opportunities and challenges for integrating delivery technologies into cancer immunotherapy, and we critically analyse the outlook for these emerging areas.","date":"2019-03","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-018-0006-z","accessDate":"2022-08-11T16:27:36Z","rights":"2018 Springer Nature Limited","extra":"Number: 3\nPublisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"18","pages":"175-196","publicationTitle":"Nature Reviews Drug Discovery","DOI":"10.1038/s41573-018-0006-z","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Rev Drug Discov","ISSN":"1474-1784","creators":[{"firstName":"Rachel S.","lastName":"Riley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carl H.","lastName":"June","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Langer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael J.","lastName":"Mitchell","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Cancer immunotherapy","type":1},{"tag":"Drug delivery","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-11T16:27:36Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:58:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/9FVT4ZXH","itemID":2586,"attachments":[{"key":"CJEKC7S6","version":7152,"itemType":"attachment","title":"riley_et_al-2019-delivery_technologies_for_cancer_immunotherapy.pdf","parentItem":"9FVT4ZXH","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nat Rev Drug Discov/riley_et_al-2019-delivery_technologies_for_cancer_immunotherapy.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:41:09Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/CJEKC7S6","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Nat Rev Drug Discov/riley_et_al-2019-delivery_technologies_for_cancer_immunotherapy.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4564/riley_et_al-2019-delivery_technologies_for_cancer_immunotherapy.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084214,"version":0},"$loki":1728},{"itemID":2595,"item":{"key":"FKYQIZE5","version":8931,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Phosphorylation-mediated RNA/peptide complex coacervation as a model for intracellular liquid organelles","abstractNote":"Biological cells are highly organized, with numerous subcellular compartments. Phosphorylation has been hypothesized as a means to control the assembly/disassembly of liquid-like RNA- and protein-rich intracellular bodies, or liquid organelles, that lack delimiting membranes. Here, we demonstrate that charge-mediated phase separation, or complex coacervation, of RNAs with cationic peptides can generate simple model liquid organelles capable of reversibly compartmentalizing biomolecules. Formation and dissolution of these liquid bodies was controlled by changes in peptide phosphorylation state using a kinase/phosphatase enzyme pair. The droplet-generating phase transition responded to modification of even a single serine residue. Electrostatic interactions between the short cationic peptides and the much longer polyanionic RNAs drove phase separation. Coacervates were also formed on silica beads, a primitive model for localization at specific intracellular sites. This work supports phosphoregulation of complex coacervation as a viable mechanism for dynamic intracellular compartmentalization in membraneless organelles.","date":"2016-02","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2414","accessDate":"2022-08-12T01:19:57Z","rights":"2015 Nature Publishing Group","extra":"Number: 2\nPublisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"8","pages":"129-137","publicationTitle":"Nature Chemistry","DOI":"10.1038/nchem.2414","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Chem","ISSN":"1755-4349","creators":[{"firstName":"William M.","lastName":"Aumiller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christine D.","lastName":"Keating","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Biophysical chemistry","type":1},{"tag":"Peptides","type":1},{"tag":"RNA","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-12T01:19:57Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T23:35:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/FKYQIZE5","itemID":2595,"attachments":[{"key":"2WYEYGET","version":7337,"itemType":"attachment","title":"aumiller_keating-2016-phosphorylation-mediated_rna-peptide_complex_coacervation_as_a_model_for.pdf","parentItem":"FKYQIZE5","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nat Chem/aumiller_keating-2016-phosphorylation-mediated_rna-peptide_complex_coacervation_as_a_model_for.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:40:58Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/2WYEYGET","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Nat Chem/aumiller_keating-2016-phosphorylation-mediated_rna-peptide_complex_coacervation_as_a_model_for.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4560/aumiller_keating-2016-phosphorylation-mediated_rna-peptide_complex_coacervation_as_a_model_for.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084214,"version":0},"$loki":1729},{"itemID":2615,"item":{"key":"G5Z9QT8P","version":8931,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Design rules for encapsulating proteins into complex coacervates","abstractNote":"We investigated the encapsulation of the model proteins bovine serum albumin (BSA), human hemoglobin (Hb), and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) into two-polymer complex coacervates as a function of polymer and solution conditions. Electrostatic parameters such as pH, protein net charge, salt concentration, and polymer charge density can be used to modulate protein uptake. While the use of a two-polymer coacervation system enables the encapsulation of weakly charged proteins that would otherwise require chemical modification to facilitate electrostatic complexation, we observed significantly higher uptake for proteins whose structure includes a cluster of like-charged residues on the protein surface. In addition to enhancing uptake, the presence of a charge patch also increased the sensitivity of the system to modulation by other parameters, including the length of the complexing polymers. Lastly, our results suggest that the distribution of charge on a protein surface may lead to different scaling behaviour for both the encapsulation efficiency and partition coefficient as a function of the absolute difference between the protein isoelectric point and the solution pH. These results provide insight into possible biophysical mechanisms whereby cells can control the uptake of proteins into coacervate-like granules, and suggest future utility in applications ranging from medicine and sensing to remediation and biocatalysis.","date":"2019-04-10","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"pubs.rsc.org","url":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/sm/c9sm00372j","accessDate":"2022-08-16T16:23:49Z","extra":"Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry","volume":"15","pages":"3089-3103","publicationTitle":"Soft Matter","DOI":"10.1039/C9SM00372J","issue":"15","journalAbbreviation":"Soft Matter","ISSN":"1744-6848","creators":[{"firstName":"Whitney C.

In tumors, the acidity of the interstitial space and the relatively well-maintained intracellular pH influence cancer and stromal cell function, their mutual interplay, and their interactions with the extracellular matrix. Tumor pH is spatially and temporally heterogeneous, and the fitness advantage of cancer cells adapted to extracellular acidity is likely particularly evident when they encounter less acidic tumor regions, for instance, during invasion. Through complex effects on genetic stability, epigenetics, cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival, the compartmentalized pH microenvironment favors cancer development. Cellular selection exacerbates the malignant phenotype, which is further enhanced by acid-induced cell motility, extracellular matrix degradation, attenuated immune responses, and modified cellular and intercellular signaling. In this review, we discuss how the acidity of the tumor microenvironment influences each stage in cancer development, from dysplasia to full-blown metastatic disease.","date":"2020","libraryCatalog":"Annual Reviews","url":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-physiol-021119-034627","accessDate":"2022-08-19T20:38:20Z","extra":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-physiol-021119-034627\nPMID: 31730395","volume":"82","pages":"103-126","publicationTitle":"Annual Review of Physiology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-physiol-021119-034627","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Annu Rev Physiol","creators":[{"firstName":"Ebbe","lastName":"Boedtkjer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stine F.","lastName":"Pedersen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"acidity","type":1},{"tag":"carcinogenesis","type":1},{"tag":"immuno-oncology","type":1},{"tag":"metabolism","type":1},{"tag":"metastasis","type":1},{"tag":"tumor vasculature","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-19T20:38:20Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T00:04:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/ANHG8KR2","itemID":2689,"attachments":[{"key":"CPEJC5IF","version":7391,"itemType":"attachment","title":"boedtkjer_pedersen-2020-the_acidic_tumor_microenvironment_as_a_driver_of_cancer.pdf","parentItem":"ANHG8KR2","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Annu Rev Physiol/boedtkjer_pedersen-2020-the_acidic_tumor_microenvironment_as_a_driver_of_cancer.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:27:06Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/CPEJC5IF","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Annu Rev Physiol/boedtkjer_pedersen-2020-the_acidic_tumor_microenvironment_as_a_driver_of_cancer.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5169/boedtkjer_pedersen-2020-the_acidic_tumor_microenvironment_as_a_driver_of_cancer.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084219,"version":0},"$loki":1736},{"itemID":2863,"item":{"key":"GD29X88J","version":8932,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Complex coacervates as a foundation for synthetic underwater adhesives","abstractNote":"Complex coacervation was proposed to play a role in the formation of the underwater bioadhesive of the Sandcastle worm (Phragmatopoma californica) based on the polyacidic and polybasic nature of the glue proteins and the balance of opposite charges at physiological pH.

The distinction may not be important because electrostatic interactions likely play an important role in the formation of the sandcastle glue. Complex coacervation has also been invoked in the formation of adhesive underwater silk fibers of caddisfly larvae and the adhesive plaques of mussels. A process similar to complex coacervation, that is, condensation and dehydration of biopolyelectrolytes through electrostatic associations, seems plausible for the caddisfly silk.

Individual worms build tubular shells under seawater by gluing together sandgrains and biomineral particles with a multipart, rapid-set, self-initiating adhesive. The glue comprises distinct sets of condensed, oppositely charged polyelectrolytic components—polyphosphates, polysulfates, and polyamines—that are separately granulated and stored at high concentration in distinct cell types. The pre-organized adhesive modules are secreted separately and intact, but rapidly fuse with minimal mixing and expand into a crack-penetrating complex fluid. Within 30s of secretion into seawater, the fluid adhesive transitions (sets) into a porous solid adhesive joint. The nano- and microporous structure of the foamy solid adhesive contributes to the strength and toughness of the adhesive joint through several mechanisms. A curing agent (catechol oxidase), co-packaged into both types of adhesive granules, covalently cross-links the adhesive and becomes a structural component of the final adhesive joint. The overall effectiveness of the granulated sandcastle glue is more a product of the cellular sorting and packaging mechanisms, the transition from fluid to solid following secretion, and its final biphasic porous structure as it is of its composition or any particular amino acid modification.","date":"2017-01-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001868616301099","accessDate":"2022-09-22T16:39:34Z","volume":"239","pages":"88-96","publicationTitle":"Advances in Colloid and Interface Science","series":"Complex Coacervation: Principles and Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.cis.2016.06.008","journalAbbreviation":"Advances in Colloid and Interface Science","ISSN":"0001-8686","creators":[{"firstName":"Russell J.","lastName":"Stewart","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ching Shuen","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"In Taek","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joshua P.","lastName":"Jones","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bioadhesive","type":1},{"tag":"Complex coacervation","type":1},{"tag":"Condensed polyelectrolytes","type":1},{"tag":"Sabellariidae","type":1},{"tag":"Sandcastle worm","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-22T16:39:35Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:58:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/BDESHBY4","itemID":2881,"attachments":[{"key":"G3U8LLLY","version":10853,"itemType":"attachment","title":"stewart_et_al-2017-the_role_of_coacervation_and_phase_transitions_in_the_sandcastle_worm_adhesive.pdf","parentItem":"BDESHBY4","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Advances in Colloid and Interface Science/stewart_et_al-2017-the_role_of_coacervation_and_phase_transitions_in_the_sandcastle_worm_adhesive2.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_G3U8LLLY/1\">1.

Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 μm), quite distinct from the molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays6. Microparticle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-lambertian viewing characteristic, result in an ‘ink on paper’ look7. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion8. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing.

Dynamic light scattering measurements indicate the presence of distinct fast and slow diffusive modes, where the fast mode is interpreted as a collective diffusion coefficient and the slow mode is attributed to the diffusion of multi-chain dynamic clusters. The relative population of fast and slow modes varies systematically with temperature and concentration. A clustering temperature (T*) was assigned when the slow mode first appeared upon cooling. The slow mode then increases in relative scattering amplitude as the phase boundary is approached. The fast mode exhibits a concentration dependence above T* consistent with the virial expansion in the collective diffusion. The sign of the virial coefficient (kd) is negative, even in the good solvent region above the expected Flory temperature (Θ ≈ 39 °C), a behavior distinct from synthetic neutral polymers in organic solvents. The onset of multi-chain clustering at T &lt; T* coincides with the poor solvent regime (T &lt; Θ). Attractive dipolar interactions due to the zwitterionic sulfobetaine groups in pAPAPS are suggested as the origin of the multi-chain clusters with no salt. Upon the addition of 100 mM NaCl, the slow mode is suppressed, and the hydrodynamic radius is consistent with polyzwitterion chain dimensions in a dilute solution. We find that concentration dependent diffusion is highly linked to the theta temperature and the emergence of dynamic clusters as the polymer goes from good to poor solvent on approach to the UCST. The slow mode in the semidilute regime is reported along with preliminary small-angle neutron scattering data that show salt reduces clustering and leads to predominantly chain scattering.","date":"2023-09-11","libraryCatalog":"Silverchair","url":"https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0162376","accessDate":"2023-10-12T17:56:17Z","volume":"159","pages":"104902","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/5.0162376","issue":"10","journalAbbreviation":"J Chem Phys","ISSN":"0021-9606","creators":[{"firstName":"Phillip D.","lastName":"Pickett","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuanchi","lastName":"Ma","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vivek M.","lastName":"Prabhu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-10-12T17:56:17Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T00:12:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/SHLS4RKA","itemID":3229,"attachments":[{"key":"VJ7YQQI2","version":7439,"itemType":"attachment","title":"pickett_ma_prabhu-2023-polyzwitterion_fast_and_slow_mode_behavior_are_coupled_to_phase_separation_as.pdf","parentItem":"SHLS4RKA","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/J Chem Phys/pickett_ma_prabhu-2023-polyzwitterion_fast_and_slow_mode_behavior_are_coupled_to_phase_separation_as.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:33:01Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/VJ7YQQI2","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/J Chem Phys/pickett_ma_prabhu-2023-polyzwitterion_fast_and_slow_mode_behavior_are_coupled_to_phase_separation_as.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4467/pickett_ma_prabhu-2023-polyzwitterion_fast_and_slow_mode_behavior_are_coupled_to_phase_separation_as.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084221,"version":0},"$loki":1743},{"itemID":5932,"item":{"key":"V48CZ6K3","version":8933,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"In Situ Polymerization of Zwitterions on Therapeutic Proteins to Enable Their Effective Oral Delivery","abstractNote":"Oral administration of protein drugs has always been challenging owing to various intestinal barriers. Herein, we developed an efficient oral protein delivery strategy by using in situ polymerization of zwitterions to encapsulate proteins, which were then loaded into enteric coated capsules for oral feeding. After oral administration of such capsules, the enteric coating would be degraded once the capsule enters the intestine, releasing polyzwitterion/protein nanocomplexes. With the help of polyzwitterion modification, such nanocomplexes were able to pass through the mucus and cellular barriers, likely by the proton-assisted amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1) pathway. Such a polyzwitterion-based protein encapsulation strategy could allow for effective oral delivery of different proteins, including bovine serum albumin (BSA), insulin, and antibodies. Using this strategy, the oral bioavailabilities of insulin and immunoglobin G (IgG) were measured to be as high as 16.9% and 12.5%, respectively. Notably, oral feeding of polyzwitterion/insulin capsules could effectively lower the blood glucose level of diabetic animals (mice, rats, and pigs). Moreover, polyzwitterion/antiprogramed death-1 (αPD-1) capsules were able to induce efficient antitumor immune responses, showing significant tumor inhibition effects toward B16F10- and 4T1-tumor bearing mouse models after oral administration. No significant toxic effect was observed for such oral protein formulations in the treated animals. Our work presents a strategy for the efficient oral delivery of protein drugs, including those with large molecular weights (e.g., antibodies) that can hardly be orally delivered using existing technologies.","date":"2023-01-24","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.2c08434","accessDate":"2024-03-20T21:30:40Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"17","pages":"1128-1143","publicationTitle":"ACS Nano","DOI":"10.1021/acsnano.2c08434","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"ACS Nano","ISSN":"1936-0851","creators":[{"firstName":"Huapan","lastName":"Fang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Linfu","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Deng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yunxuan","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhuang","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/F7CLNTSF"]},"dateAdded":"2023-01-04T16:36:31Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T21:32:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/V48CZ6K3","itemID":5932,"attachments":[{"key":"D79EKFSM","version":7072,"itemType":"attachment","title":"fang_et_al-2023-in_situ_polymerization_of_zwitterions_on_therapeutic_proteins_to_enable_their.pdf","parentItem":"V48CZ6K3","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/ACS Nano/fang_et_al-2023-in_situ_polymerization_of_zwitterions_on_therapeutic_proteins_to_enable_their.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T21:31:00Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:09:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/D79EKFSM","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/ACS Nano/fang_et_al-2023-in_situ_polymerization_of_zwitterions_on_therapeutic_proteins_to_enable_their.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5946/fang_et_al-2023-in_situ_polymerization_of_zwitterions_on_therapeutic_proteins_to_enable_their.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084222,"version":0},"$loki":1744},{"itemID":5959,"item":{"key":"SD9BQREB","version":8933,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Trigger Chemistries for Better Industrial Formulations","abstractNote":"In recent years, innovations and consumer demands have led to increasingly complex liquid formulations. These growing complexities have provided industrial players and their customers access to new markets through product differentiation, improved performance, and compatibility/stability with other products. One strategy for enabling more complex formulations is the use of active encapsulation. When encapsulation is employed, strategies are required to effect the release of the active at the desired location and time of action. One particular route that has received significant academic research effort is the employment of triggers to induce active release upon a specific stimulus, though little has translated for industrial use to date. To address emerging industrial formulation needs, in this review, we discuss areas of trigger release chemistries and their applications specifically as relevant to industrial use. We focus the discussion on the use of heat, light, shear, and pH triggers as applied in several model polymeric systems for inducing active release. The goal is that through this review trends will emerge for how technologies can be better developed to maximize their value through industrial adaptation.","date":"2015-04-01","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b00485","accessDate":"2024-03-20T21:37:55Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society\nCitation Key: wangTriggerChemistriesBetter2015","volume":"7","pages":"6369-6382","publicationTitle":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","DOI":"10.1021/acsami.5b00485","issue":"12","journalAbbreviation":"ACS Appl.

In a multicentre study (N = 330), we have assessed the skin surface pH of the volar forearm before and after refraining from showering and cosmetic product application for 24 h. The average pH dropped from 5.12 ± 0.56 to 4.93 ± 0.45. On the basis of this pH drop, it is estimated that the ‘natural’ skin surface pH is on average 4.7, i.e. below 5. This is in line with existing literature, where a relatively large number of reports (c. 50%) actually describes pH values below 5.0; this is in contrast to the general assumption, that skin surface pH is on average between 5.0 and 6.0. Not only prior use of cosmetic products, especially soaps, have profound influence on skin surface pH, but the use of plain tap water, in Europe with a pH value generally around 8.0, will increase skin pH up to 6 h after application before returning to its ‘natural’ value of on average below 5.0. It is demonstrated that skin with pH values below 5.0 is in a better condition than skin with pH values above 5.0, as shown by measuring the biophysical parameters of barrier function, moisturization and scaling. The effect of pH on adhesion of resident skin microflora was also assessed; an acid skin pH (4–4.5) keeps the resident bacterial flora attached to the skin, whereas an alkaline pH (8–9) promotes the dispersal from the skin.","date":"2006","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00344.x","accessDate":"2024-03-20T21:37:59Z","extra":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00344.x\nCitation Key: lambersNaturalSkinSurface2006","volume":"28","pages":"359-370","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Cosmetic Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00344.x","issue":"5","ISSN":"1468-2494","creators":[{"firstName":"H.","lastName":"Lambers","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Piessens","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Bloem","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"H.","lastName":"Pronk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Finkel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"microflora","type":1},{"tag":"skin moisture","type":1},{"tag":"skin pH","type":1},{"tag":"skin scaling","type":1},{"tag":"TEWL","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/6JGU8RLQ"]},"dateAdded":"2022-08-19T18:37:41Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T20:41:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/GY6M94R2","itemID":5965,"attachments":[{"key":"Q59NLMN6","version":7102,"itemType":"attachment","title":"lambers_et_al-2006-natural_skin_surface_ph_is_on_average_below_5,_which_is_beneficial_for_its.pdf","parentItem":"GY6M94R2","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/International Journal of Cosmetic Science/lambers_et_al-2006-natural_skin_surface_ph_is_on_average_below_5,_which_is_beneficial_for_its.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T21:38:17Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:10:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/Q59NLMN6","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/International Journal of Cosmetic Science/lambers_et_al-2006-natural_skin_surface_ph_is_on_average_below_5,_which_is_beneficial_for_its.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5978/lambers_et_al-2006-natural_skin_surface_ph_is_on_average_below_5,_which_is_beneficial_for_its.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084223,"version":0},"$loki":1746},{"itemID":5986,"item":{"key":"59A95PBJ","version":8933,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease","abstractNote":"Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nonliving matter, and recent discoveries have shown that they also play a key role within living cells.

Although passive and active targeted-drug delivery has addressed a number of important issues, additional properties that can be included in nanocarrier systems to enhance the bioavailability of drugs at the disease site, and especially upon cellular internalization, are very important. A nanocarrier system incorporated with stimuli-responsive property (e.g., pH, temperature, or redox potential), for instance, would be amenable to address some of the systemic and intracellular delivery barriers. In this review, we discuss the role of stimuli-responsive nanocarrier systems for drug and gene delivery. The advancement in material science has led to design of a variety of materials, which are used for development of nanocarrier systems that can respond to biological stimuli. Temperature, pH, and hypoxia are examples of “triggers” at the diseased site that could be exploited with stimuli-responsive nanocarriers. With greater understanding of the difference between normal and pathological tissues and cells and parallel developments in material design, there is a highly promising role of stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for drug and gene delivery in the future.","date":"2008-03-20","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365908000254","accessDate":"2024-03-21T15:37:07Z","volume":"126","pages":"187-204","publicationTitle":"Journal of Controlled Release","DOI":"10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.12.017","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Controlled Release","ISSN":"0168-3659","creators":[{"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Ganta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harikrishna","lastName":"Devalapally","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aliasgar","lastName":"Shahiwala","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mansoor","lastName":"Amiji","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Nanotechnology","type":1},{"tag":"pH","type":1},{"tag":"Redox potential","type":1},{"tag":"Stimuli-responsive nanocarriers","type":1},{"tag":"Targeted delivery","type":1},{"tag":"Temperature","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T15:37:07Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T15:37:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/3Q3NQ8EV","itemID":6297,"attachments":[{"key":"84YKAB98","version":7074,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ganta_et_al-2008-a_review_of_stimuli-responsive_nanocarriers_for_drug_and_gene_delivery.pdf","parentItem":"3Q3NQ8EV","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Journal of Controlled Release/ganta_et_al-2008-a_review_of_stimuli-responsive_nanocarriers_for_drug_and_gene_delivery.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T18:20:37Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:09:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/84YKAB98","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Journal of Controlled Release/ganta_et_al-2008-a_review_of_stimuli-responsive_nanocarriers_for_drug_and_gene_delivery.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6780/ganta_et_al-2008-a_review_of_stimuli-responsive_nanocarriers_for_drug_and_gene_delivery.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084226,"version":0},"$loki":1751},{"itemID":6391,"item":{"key":"I4QNA62D","version":8934,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Preparation of polyelectrolyte-coated pH-sensitive poly(styrene) microcapsules and their application to initiation-cessation control of an enzyme reaction","abstractNote":"Poly(styrene) microcapsules, prepared by depositing the polymer around emulsified aqueous droplets, were coated with a synthesized polyelectrolyte; i.e., copolymer of maleic acid (MA) with methyl vinyl ether (MVE), co-poly(MA, MVE), or with styrene (St), copoly(Ma, St). The permeability of the capsule membrane was investigated under various pHs of the outer medium using n-propyl alcohol as a permeant. It became apparent that either copoly(MA, St)- or copoly(MA, MVE)-coated microcapsules function as a pH-sensitive capsule. In particular, the former showed a dramatic change of the permeability in response to small differences in pH (5–6). By reference to the viscometric and electrophoretic studies of both copolymers, these were interpreted as being due to a pH-induced alteration of the configuration of the copolymer coating on the surface of the capsule membrane. When sucrose was hydrolyzed in an aqueous suspension of the copoly(MA, St)-coated capsules into which invertase was loaded, the hydrolytic reaction was initiated at pH 5. 5 and stopped at pH 4. 5. Such initiation-cessation control was repeated reversibly without damaging the capsules.","date":"1988","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.260320305","accessDate":"2024-03-21T15:50:57Z","rights":"Copyright © 1988 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","extra":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bit.260320305","volume":"32","pages":"289-294","publicationTitle":"Biotechnology and Bioengineering","DOI":"10.1002/bit.260320305","issue":"3","ISSN":"1097-0290","creators":[{"firstName":"Etsuo","lastName":"Kokufuta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Noboru","lastName":"Shimizu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Isei","lastName":"Nakamura","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T15:50:59Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T15:50:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/I4QNA62D","itemID":6391,"attachments":[{"key":"ZLRAGHRS","version":7095,"itemType":"attachment","title":"kokufuta_shimizu_nakamura-1988-preparation_of_polyelectrolyte-coated_ph-sensitive_poly(styrene)_microcapsules.pdf","parentItem":"I4QNA62D","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Biotechnology and Bioengineering/kokufuta_shimizu_nakamura-1988-preparation_of_polyelectrolyte-coated_ph-sensitive_poly(styrene)_microcapsules.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T18:41:20Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:10:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/ZLRAGHRS","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Biotechnology and Bioengineering/kokufuta_shimizu_nakamura-1988-preparation_of_polyelectrolyte-coated_ph-sensitive_poly(styrene)_microcapsules.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6814/kokufuta_shimizu_nakamura-1988-preparation_of_polyelectrolyte-coated_ph-sensitive_poly(styrene)_microcapsules.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084226,"version":0},"$loki":1752},{"itemID":6412,"item":{"key":"HQWTCF67","version":10681,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Convergence Properties of the Nelder-Mead Simplex Method in Low Dimensions","abstractNote":"This paper analyzes the behavior of the Nelder--Mead simplex method for a family of examples which cause the method to converge to a nonstationary point.

It has been suggested that complex coacervation (liquid–liquid phase separation via concentration) might be involved in the highly condensed and non-water dispersed adhesion process of mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs). However, as purified natural MAPs are difficult to obtain, it has not been possible to experimentally validate the coacervation model. In the present work, we demonstrate complex coacervation in a system including recombinant MAPs and hyaluronic acid (HA). Our recombinant hybrid MAPs, fp-151 and fp-131, can be produced in large quantities, and are readily purified. We observed successful complex coacervation using cationic fp-151 or fp-131, and an anionic HA partner. Importantly, we found that highly condensed complex coacervates significantly increased the bulk adhesive strength of MAPs in both dry and wet environments. In addition, oil droplets were successfully engulfed using a MAP-based interfacial coacervation process, to form microencapsulated particles. Collectively, our results indicate that a complex coacervation system based on MAPs shows superior adhesive properties, combined with additional valuable features including liquid/liquid phase separation and appropriate viscoelasticity. Our microencapsulation system could be useful in the development of new adhesive biomaterials, including self-adhesive microencapsulated drug carriers, for use in biotechnological and biomedical applications.","date":"2010-05-01","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961210000955","accessDate":"2024-03-21T16:04:40Z","volume":"31","pages":"3715-3722","publicationTitle":"Biomaterials","DOI":"10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.063","issue":"13","journalAbbreviation":"Biomaterials","ISSN":"0142-9612","creators":[{"firstName":"Seonghye","lastName":"Lim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yoo Seong","lastName":"Choi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dong Gyun","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Young Hoon","lastName":"Song","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hyung Joon","lastName":"Cha","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Coacervation","type":1},{"tag":"Bulk adhesion","type":1},{"tag":"Hyaluronic acid","type":1},{"tag":"Microencapsulation","type":1},{"tag":"Mussel adhesive protein","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:04:41Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T16:04:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/E3ZQQTKN","itemID":6425,"attachments":[{"key":"7KRJDLMT","version":7109,"itemType":"attachment","title":"lim_et_al-2010-the_adhesive_properties_of_coacervated_recombinant_hybrid_mussel_adhesive.pdf","parentItem":"E3ZQQTKN","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Biomaterials/lim_et_al-2010-the_adhesive_properties_of_coacervated_recombinant_hybrid_mussel_adhesive.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T18:11:01Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:10:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/7KRJDLMT","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Biomaterials/lim_et_al-2010-the_adhesive_properties_of_coacervated_recombinant_hybrid_mussel_adhesive.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6748/lim_et_al-2010-the_adhesive_properties_of_coacervated_recombinant_hybrid_mussel_adhesive.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084227,"version":0},"$loki":1754},{"itemID":6482,"item":{"key":"P2AT47TS","version":8934,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Influence of Dipole Orientation on Solution Properties of Polyzwitterions","abstractNote":"We have studied the influence of segmental dipole orientation on the solution properties of polyzwitterions using dynamic and static light scattering of poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC), n-butyl-substituted choline phosphate polymers (PMBP), and their diblock (PMPC-b-PMBP) copolymers in solutions of different salt concentration. We find that these three structures exhibit dramatically different aggregation behaviors. For the conditions in our study, PMPC is a swollen excluded-volume chain without significant presence of dipolar correlations as evident from the lack of sensitivity to the ionic strength of the solution. In contrast, PMBP self-assembles into finite-sized structures in solution, which are stabilized by electrostatic dipole–dipole interactions. Evidence of these interactions is also present in the diblock polymer, PMPB-b-PMPC, which self-assembles into two distinct, stable aggregates in addition to unaggregated chains. These results contribute to the breadth of understanding of polyzwitterions in solution and provide a platform for future simulation and experimental explorations.","date":"2016-01-19","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmacrolett.5b00876","accessDate":"2024-03-21T16:13:38Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"5","pages":"118-122","publicationTitle":"ACS Macro Letters","DOI":"10.1021/acsmacrolett.5b00876","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"ACS Macro Lett.","creators":[{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Morozova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T.","lastName":"Emrick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Muthukumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:13:38Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T16:13:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/P2AT47TS","itemID":6482,"attachments":[{"key":"EW4ZC6LQ","version":7125,"itemType":"attachment","title":"morozova_et_al-2016-influence_of_dipole_orientation_on_solution_properties_of_polyzwitterions.pdf","parentItem":"P2AT47TS","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/ACS Macro Lett./morozova_et_al-2016-influence_of_dipole_orientation_on_solution_properties_of_polyzwitterions.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:13:40Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/EW4ZC6LQ","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/ACS Macro Lett./morozova_et_al-2016-influence_of_dipole_orientation_on_solution_properties_of_polyzwitterions.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6484/morozova_et_al-2016-influence_of_dipole_orientation_on_solution_properties_of_polyzwitterions.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084227,"version":0},"$loki":1755},{"itemID":6510,"item":{"key":"WWIRABXX","version":8934,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Expanding the structural diversity of polyelectrolyte complexes and polyzwitterions","abstractNote":"Charged (macro)molecules are essential components in natural materials and organisms; thus the rational design of biomimetic materials requires a holistic understanding of structure–property relationships in charged systems.

The importance of each reaction is controlled by a corresponding chemistry-dependent standard free energy input parameter. Our model also accounts for Born (or ion solvation) energy using a linear mixing rule for the effective dielectric constant. In monophasic systems, the proposed model can qualitatively explain the observed shifts in acidity and basicity observed in potentiometric titration of weak PEs in the presence of salt and oppositely charged PEs in accordance with Le Châtelier’s principle. We demonstrate how a competition between counterion condensation (CC) and IP alone can explain the complex coacervation of strongly charged PEs as well as the existence of a critical salt concentration. Binodal diagrams predicted in our model are also affected by long-ranged electrostatics and are most sensitive to IP strength both for weak and strong PEs. The extent of IP increases in the dense phase at the expense of reduced CC upon coacervation consistent with counter release view of complex coacervation. We compare binodal diagrams predicted by our model against experimental data for both weakly and strongly dissociating polyions pairs and find a plausible parameter set that leads to an acceptable and partial agreement with experiments in the two cases, respectively.","date":"2016-12-27","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.6b01464","accessDate":"2024-03-21T16:24:08Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"49","pages":"9706-9719","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.macromol.6b01464","issue":"24","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Salehi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronald G.","lastName":"Larson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:24:10Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T16:24:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/P7AXLJEF","itemID":6562,"attachments":[{"key":"CVW4TF5N","version":7156,"itemType":"attachment","title":"salehi_larson-2016-a_molecular_thermodynamic_model_of_complexation_in_mixtures_of_oppositely.pdf","parentItem":"P7AXLJEF","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/salehi_larson-2016-a_molecular_thermodynamic_model_of_complexation_in_mixtures_of_oppositely.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:24:16Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/CVW4TF5N","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/salehi_larson-2016-a_molecular_thermodynamic_model_of_complexation_in_mixtures_of_oppositely.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6569/salehi_larson-2016-a_molecular_thermodynamic_model_of_complexation_in_mixtures_of_oppositely.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084229,"version":0},"$loki":1759},{"itemID":6575,"item":{"key":"ABNXSL9S","version":8934,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Protein/polysaccharide complexes and coacervates in food systems","abstractNote":"Since the pioneering work of Bungenberg de Jong and co-workers on gelatin–acacia gum complex coacervation in the 1920–40s, protein/polysaccharide complexes and coacervates have received increasing research interest in order to broaden the possible food applications.

Cross-sectional analysis indicated that the beads had a homogeneous crosslinked structure, as a result the beads were strengthened greatly (the mechanical strength increased more than ten times). Furthermore sodium alginate (a polyanion) can interact with cationic chitosan on the surface of these TPP/chitosan beads to form polyelectrolyte complex film for the improvement of the drug sustained release performances. The loading efficiency of model drugs (brilliant blue and FITC-dextran) in these beads was very high (more than 90%). Crosslinking time, TPP solution pH and other preparation factors had an effect on the drug release performance of beads. The release period of brilliant blue (a poor water soluble dye) was more than 2-months at a fairly constant rate in 0.9% NaCl, 10 mM PBS pH 7.4. However, for FITC-dextran (a water soluble polysaccharide) only 1–2 days in the same conditions.

The water content of polyelectrolyte complexes obtained has a lower limit of about 65%, practically independent of chain length, and increases with increasing salt concentration. We interpret our results on binodal compositions, water content and critical salt concentration as a function of chain length using the mean-field model of Voorn and Overbeek and find good quantitative agreement with our experiments using only one adjustable parameter.

By combining the cluster theory in dilute solution with our recently developed mean-field theory for inhomogeneous polyelectrolyte solutions (Zhang, P.; Wang, Z.-G. Macromolecules 2021, 54, 10994), we systematically investigate the structure of finite-sized clusters formed by oppositely charged polyions in symmetric dilute solutions and how these clusters affect the binodal, spinodal, and nucleation for polyelectrolyte complex coacervation. We find that both the polyion concentration deep inside the cluster and the interfacial tension decrease with increasing the cluster size, reaching their respective bulk coexistence values with corrections inversely proportional to the cluster radius. The polyion concentration in the supernatant phase at coexistence is several orders of magnitude higher than that obtained under the uniform mixing approximation. For most relevant conditions away from the critical point, the supernatant phase consists predominantly of polyion pairs. By examining the nucleation barrier in supersaturated solutions, we can determine a pseudo-spinodal when the barrier is a few multiples of the thermal energy. The location of this pseudo-spinodal is similarly shifted to much higher concentrations than predicted under the uniform mixing approximation. Making the volume approximation for the clusters, we obtain simple analytical expressions for the cluster formation free energy, the modified binodal, and the pseudo-spinodal. In particular, we propose a simple approximate formula for estimating the concentration of the coexisting supernatant phase in terms of the chain length, interfacial tension, and the polyion concentration in the coacervate phase.","date":"2022-05-24","shortTitle":"Supernatant Phase in Polyelectrolyte Complex Coacervation","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00340","accessDate":"2024-03-21T16:34:39Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"55","pages":"3910-3923","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00340","issue":"10","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhen-Gang","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:34:39Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T16:34:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/IN5ARXB2","itemID":6631,"attachments":[{"key":"6HZCRPHS","version":7199,"itemType":"attachment","title":"zhang_wang-2022-supernatant_phase_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervation.pdf","parentItem":"IN5ARXB2","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/zhang_wang-2022-supernatant_phase_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:35:03Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:12:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/6HZCRPHS","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/zhang_wang-2022-supernatant_phase_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervation.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6647/zhang_wang-2022-supernatant_phase_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervation.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084232,"version":0},"$loki":1765},{"itemID":6729,"item":{"key":"ESMQU6PD","version":8935,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Polyelectrolyte Complex Coacervates: Recent Developments and New Frontiers","abstractNote":"Polyelectrolyte complex coacervates represent a wide class of materials with applications ranging from coatings and adhesives to pharmaceutical technologies.

However, the complexity of protein structure limits our ability to predict the properties of the formed nanoparticles, and our goal is to identify the key triggers of the morphological transition in protein/PE complexes and evaluate their ability to encapsulate multivalent ionic drugs. A positively charged PE can assemble with a protein at pH above isoelectric point due to the electrostatic attraction and disassemble at pH below isoelectric point due to the repulsion. The additional hydrophilic block of the polymer should stabilize the particles in solution and enable them to encapsulate a negatively charged drug in the presence of PE excess. We demonstrated that diblock copolymers, poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(N,N,N-trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate), consisting of a polycation block and a neutral hydrophilic block, reversibly co-assemble with insulin in pH range between 5 and 8. Using small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), we showed that insulin arrangement within formed particles is controlled by intermolecular electrostatic forces between protein molecules, and can be tuned by varying ionic strength. For the first time, we observed by fluorescence that formed protein/PE complexes with excess of positive charges exhibited potential for encapsulating and controlled release of negatively charged bivalent drugs, protoporphyrin-IX and zinc(II) protoporphyrin-IX, enabling the development of nanocarriers for combination therapies with adjustable charge, stability, internal structure, and size.","date":"2024-07-01","shortTitle":"Polyelectrolyte-protein synergism","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979724006581","accessDate":"2024-04-01T14:48:54Z","volume":"665","pages":"801-813","publicationTitle":"Journal of Colloid and Interface Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcis.2024.03.156","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Colloid and Interface Science","ISSN":"0021-9797","creators":[{"firstName":"Anastasiia","lastName":"Murmiliuk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Iwase","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jia-Jhen","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shilpa","lastName":"Mohanakumar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie-Sousai","lastName":"Appavou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kathleen","lastName":"Wood","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"László","lastName":"Almásy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adél","lastName":"Len","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kuno","lastName":"Schwärzer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jürgen","lastName":"Allgaier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Dulle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gensch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Beate","lastName":"Förster","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kanae","lastName":"Ito","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Nakagawa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Wiegand","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Förster","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aurel","lastName":"Radulescu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Protein","type":1},{"tag":"Block polyelectrolyte","type":1},{"tag":"Core/shell particles","type":1},{"tag":"Electrostatic co-assembly","type":1},{"tag":"Insulin","type":1},{"tag":"Small-angle scattering","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/SS5ZQSJT"]},"dateAdded":"2024-03-28T14:19:54Z","dateModified":"2024-04-09T17:01:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/A7I2DWCY","itemID":7195,"attachments":[{"key":"IAEZ4SKF","version":7707,"itemType":"attachment","title":"murmiliuk_et_al-2024-polyelectrolyte-protein_synergism.pdf","parentItem":"A7I2DWCY","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Journal of Colloid and Interface Science/murmiliuk_et_al-2024-polyelectrolyte-protein_synergism2.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-04-01T14:53:52Z","dateModified":"2024-04-01T14:53:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/IAEZ4SKF","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Journal of Colloid and Interface Science/murmiliuk_et_al-2024-polyelectrolyte-protein_synergism2.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7206/murmiliuk_et_al-2024-polyelectrolyte-protein_synergism2.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084233,"version":0},"$loki":1768},{"itemID":7388,"item":{"key":"M9M8A24B","version":8935,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Active coacervate droplets are protocells that grow and resist Ostwald ripening","abstractNote":"Active coacervate droplets are liquid condensates coupled to a chemical reaction that turns over their components, keeping the droplets out of equilibrium.

Moreover, controlled growth is a key requirement to achieve population fitness and survival. Here we present a minimal, nucleotide-based coacervate model for active droplets, and report three key findings that make these droplets into evolvable protocells. First, we show that coacervate droplets form and grow by the fuel-driven synthesis of new coacervate material. Second, we find that these droplets do not undergo Ostwald ripening, which we attribute to the attractive electrostatic interactions and translational entropy within complex coacervates, active or passive. Finally, we show that the droplet growth rate reflects experimental conditions such as substrate, enzyme and protein concentration, and that a different droplet composition (addition of RNA) leads to altered growth rates and droplet fitness. These findings together make active coacervate droplets a powerful platform to mimic cellular growth at a single-droplet level, and to study fitness at a population level.","date":"2021-06-21","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24111-x","accessDate":"2024-05-06T20:11:12Z","rights":"2021 The Author(s)","extra":"Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"12","pages":"3819","publicationTitle":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-24111-x","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Commun","ISSN":"2041-1723","creators":[{"firstName":"Karina K.","lastName":"Nakashima","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Merlijn H.

However, the commercialization is severely hampered by the large strain and short cycle life. Herein, we have synthesized a reversible polyelectrolyte/polyzwitterion coacervate framework to achieve high-performance silicon anodes with high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and stable cyclability. Such coacervate framework is formed via in-situ free radical polymerization of zwitterionic 2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) with polyacrylic acid (pAA) during heating the slurry. The resulting pAA/pMPC coacervate framework presents excellent adhesion, thermal stability, and negligible swelling in the electrolyte. Comparing with pAA, pAA/pMPC0.1 coacervate framework binder exhibits superior performance during charge/discharge. The ICE is improved from 84.41%, to 87.61%. After 250 cycles, the specific capacity of pAA/pMPC0.1 silicon anode is 1678 mAh g-1 with a retention of 78% while the pAA silicon anode completely failed after less than 200 cycles. Such improvement is ascribed to the structural integrity of the electrode endowed by the self-healing ability of pAA/pMPC coacervate framework. This work not only offers a feasible method to in-situ construct coacervate framework with self-healing capability to achieve high-performance silicon anodes but also a compatible electrode preparation process for other high-capacity materials.","date":"2024","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/batt.202400030","accessDate":"2024-05-10T18:14:48Z","rights":"© 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH","extra":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/batt.202400030","pages":"e202400030","publicationTitle":"Batteries & Supercaps","DOI":"10.1002/batt.202400030","ISSN":"2566-6223","creators":[{"firstName":"Yingchuan","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yongkang","lastName":"Han","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yike","lastName":"Lei","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Ni","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qiangfeng","lastName":"Xiao","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"binder","type":1},{"tag":"lithium ion battery","type":1},{"tag":"polyzwitterion","type":1},{"tag":"silicon anode","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/ADPR8YVA"]},"dateAdded":"2024-04-10T17:58:14Z","dateModified":"2024-05-10T22:05:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/FCURCDPN","itemID":7409,"attachments":[{"key":"RVBJNS4W","version":8555,"itemType":"attachment","title":"zhang_et_al-in-situ_construction_of_polyelectrolyte-polyzwitterion_coacervate_framework_for.pdf","parentItem":"FCURCDPN","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Batteries & Supercaps/zhang_et_al-in-situ_construction_of_polyelectrolyte-polyzwitterion_coacervate_framework_for3.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/6YEVGK3D"]},"dateAdded":"2024-05-10T18:15:04Z","dateModified":"2024-05-10T18:20:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/RVBJNS4W","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Batteries & Supercaps/zhang_et_al-in-situ_construction_of_polyelectrolyte-polyzwitterion_coacervate_framework_for3.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7411/zhang_et_al-in-situ_construction_of_polyelectrolyte-polyzwitterion_coacervate_framework_for3.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084234,"version":0},"$loki":1770},{"itemID":7790,"item":{"key":"V3GNGIN2","version":10615,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Effect of Polypeptide Complex Coacervate Microenvironment on Protonation of a Guest Molecule","abstractNote":"Complex coacervate droplets formed by the liquid–liquid phase separation of polyelectrolyte solutions capture several important features of membraneless organelles including their ability to accumulate guest molecules and to provide distinct microenvironments. Here, we examine how polyions in complex coacervates can influence localized guest molecules, leading to a shifted protonation state of the guest molecule in response to its electrostatic environment. A fluorescent ratiometric pH indicator dye was used as a model guest molecule able to report its protonation state in the coacervate phase. Experimentally observed differences in dye-reported local apparent pH inside versus outside of coacervate droplets were largest for polyion pairs having lower salt stabilities and/or larger polyion length mismatch, which we attribute to the relative concentration of open sites on polyions within the coacervates based on theoretical calculations. Using the transfer matrix method, we confirmed that theoretical phase diagrams and critical salt stabilities generated for each polyion pair were consistent with experimental turbidity measurements and estimated the amount of available binding sites on polyions for guest molecules. We conclude that dye molecules likely experience an effective pKa shift due to interactions with coacervate polyions rather than reporting directly on local proton concentrations. Such a local pKa shift can also be anticipated for other guest molecules having protonatable groups, including, for example, many metabolites, ligands, and/or drug molecules that partition into coacervates or membraneless organelles based on ion pairing interactions.","date":"2023-07-06","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c02098","accessDate":"2024-07-08T18:42:25Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"127","pages":"5978-5991","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry B","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c02098","issue":"26","journalAbbreviation":"J.

We present a new coarse-grained model for the Grand-reaction method that enables us to determine the composition of the coexisting phases in a broad range of pH and salt concentrations. We validate the model by comparing it to recent simulations and experimental studies, as well as our own experiments on poly(acrylic acid)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) complexes. The simulations using our model predict that monovalent ions partition approximately equally between both phases, whereas divalent ones accumulate in the PEC phase. On a semiquantitative level, these results agree with our own experiments, as well as with other experiments and simulations in the literature. In the sequel, we use the model to study the partitioning of a weak diprotic acid at various pH values of the supernatant. Our results show that the ionization of the acid is enhanced in the PEC phase, resulting in its preferential accumulation in this phase, which monotonically increases with the pH. Currently, this effect is still waiting to be confirmed experimentally. We explore how the model parameters (particle size, charge density, permittivity, and solvent quality) affect the measured partition coefficients, showing that fine-tuning of these parameters can make the agreement with the experiments almost quantitative. Nevertheless, our results show that charge regulation in multivalent solutes can potentially be exploited in engineering the partitioning of charged molecules in PEC-based systems at various pH values.","date":"2024-02-13","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.3c01209","accessDate":"2024-07-09T02:46:30Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"57","pages":"1383-1398","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.macromol.3c01209","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Staňo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jéré J.","lastName":"van Lente","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Saskia","lastName":"Lindhoud","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Košovan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-09T02:46:30Z","dateModified":"2024-07-09T02:46:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/PEFV59SJ","itemID":7797,"attachments":[{"key":"PYMJZXLY","version":10067,"itemType":"attachment","title":"staňo_et_al-2024-sequestration_of_small_ions_and_weak_acids_and_bases_by_a_polyelectrolyte.pdf","parentItem":"PEFV59SJ","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/staňo_et_al-2024-sequestration_of_small_ions_and_weak_acids_and_bases_by_a_polyelectrolyte.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-09T02:46:31Z","dateModified":"2024-07-09T02:46:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/PYMJZXLY","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/staňo_et_al-2024-sequestration_of_small_ions_and_weak_acids_and_bases_by_a_polyelectrolyte.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7799/staňo_et_al-2024-sequestration_of_small_ions_and_weak_acids_and_bases_by_a_polyelectrolyte.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084236,"version":0},"$loki":1775},{"itemID":7862,"item":{"key":"ZTUSJ9JY","version":10615,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Chemical specificity in polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte coacervates: polycations vs polyanions","abstractNote":"Aqueous solutions containing polyzwitterions and polyelectrolytes were studied to probe the effects of chemical specificity on the complexation among different types of chains and resulting liquid–liquid phase separation (coacervation). Two kinds of blends were studied. A polyzwitterion, poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA), was blended with either (1) a polycation, poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC), or (2) a polyanion, sodium poly(styrene sulphonate) (NaPSS). Coacervation was observed in both blends after equilibration, while the freshly prepared blend solutions exhibited distinct behavior dependent on the mixing protocols. Mixing solutions of the polyzwitterions and the polycations led to coacervation almost instantaneously. In contrast, the blends containing the same polyzwitterions and the polyanions exhibited no such coacervation by following the same mixing protocol. However, blends prepared after dissolving a solid mixture containing the same polyzwitterions and the polyanions in water exhibited coacervation. Based on the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryo-electron microscopy, and rheology measurements, complexation and coacervation in the polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte blends is rationalized in terms of the entropy change associated with reorganization of solvent (water), which appears to be larger in the polyzwitterion-polycation case in comparison with the polyzwitterion-polyanion blends. These results highlight the importance of chemical specificity and mixing protocols leading to metastable structures in designing a new class of materials based on macromolecular complexation of polyzwitterions.","date":"2024-07-17","shortTitle":"Chemical specificity in polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte coacervates","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014305724004385","accessDate":"2024-07-13T19:51:49Z","volume":"215","pages":"113177","publicationTitle":"European Polymer Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2024.113177","journalAbbreviation":"European Polymer Journal","ISSN":"0014-3057","creators":[{"firstName":"Jong K.","lastName":"Keum","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Christakopoulos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zening","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tianyu","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jihua","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexis","lastName":"Williams","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dale K.","lastName":"Hensley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kunlun","lastName":"Hong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rigoberto","lastName":"Advincula","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Kumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Coacervation","type":1},{"tag":"Polyelectrolytes","type":1},{"tag":"Polyzwitterions","type":1}],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-13T19:51:50Z","dateModified":"2024-07-13T19:51:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/ZTUSJ9JY","itemID":7862,"attachments":[{"key":"6APER5A8","version":10537,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Keum et al. - 2024 - Chemical specificity in polyzwitterion-polyelectro.pdf","parentItem":"ZTUSJ9JY","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"/Users/samhoover/Downloads/Keum et al. - 2024 - Chemical specificity in polyzwitterion-polyelectro.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

However, the true phase behavior of complexes, resulting from associative phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, remains poorly understood. Here, we rely on complementary experimental and simulation approaches to create a complete quantitative description of the phase behavior of polyelectrolyte complexes that represents a significant advance in our understanding of the underlying physics of polyelectrolyte complexation. Experiments employing multiple approaches with model polyelectrolytes—oppositely charged polypeptides poly(l-lysine) and poly(d,l-glutamic acid) of matched chain lengths—led to phase diagrams with compositions of the complex and the supernatant that were in excellent agreement with simulation results. Contrary to the widely accepted theory for complexation, we found preferential partitioning of salt ions into the supernatant phase. Additionally, the salt partitioning into the supernatant phase was found to initially increase and then decrease on increasing the salt concentrations, manifesting as a distinct minimum in the salt partition coefficients. These trends were shown by simulations to be strongly influenced by the excluded volume interactions in the complex phase, which were not accounted for in their entirety in earlier theories. We believe the comprehensive data we present will be conducive to the development of an accurate physical theory for polyelectrolyte complexation with predictive capabilities.","date":"2018-04-24","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b00238","accessDate":"2024-07-14T00:41:46Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"51","pages":"2988-2995","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.macromol.8b00238","issue":"8","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Samanvaya","lastName":"Srivastava","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marat","lastName":"Andreev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amanda B.","lastName":"Marciel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Juan J.","lastName":"de Pablo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew V.","lastName":"Tirrell","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-14T00:41:46Z","dateModified":"2024-07-14T00:41:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/RJB9JVN8","itemID":7869,"attachments":[{"key":"Q53PM34Y","version":10593,"itemType":"attachment","title":"li_et_al-2018-phase_behavior_and_salt_partitioning_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervates.pdf","parentItem":"RJB9JVN8","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/li_et_al-2018-phase_behavior_and_salt_partitioning_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervates.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-14T00:41:49Z","dateModified":"2024-07-14T00:41:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/Q53PM34Y","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/li_et_al-2018-phase_behavior_and_salt_partitioning_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervates.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7871/li_et_al-2018-phase_behavior_and_salt_partitioning_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervates.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084237,"version":0},"$loki":1779},{"itemID":659,"item":{"key":"BGL653WD","version":10190,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold","abstractNote":"Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.","date":"2021","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34265844 http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2","extra":"PMID: 34265844","publicationTitle":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2","ISSN":"0028-0836","creators":[{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Jumper","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Evans","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Pritzel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Green","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Figurnov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Olaf","lastName":"Ronneberger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kathryn","lastName":"Tunyasuvunakool","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Russ","lastName":"Bates","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Augustin","lastName":"Žídek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Potapenko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Bridgland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Meyer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Simon A A","lastName":"Kohl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrew J","lastName":"Ballard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Cowie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bernardino","lastName":"Romera-Paredes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stanislav","lastName":"Nikolov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rishub","lastName":"Jain","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Adler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Back","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stig","lastName":"Petersen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Reiman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ellen","lastName":"Clancy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Zielinski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Steinegger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michalina","lastName":"Pacholska","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tamas","lastName":"Berghammer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Bodenstein","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Silver","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oriol","lastName":"Vinyals","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrew W","lastName":"Senior","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Koray","lastName":"Kavukcuoglu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pushmeet","lastName":"Kohli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Demis","lastName":"Hassabis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-30T20:16:43Z","dateModified":"2021-08-02T01:22:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/BGL653WD","itemID":659,"attachments":[{"key":"5YSENZEG","version":7086,"itemType":"attachment","title":"jumper_et_al-2021-highly_accurate_protein_structure_prediction_with_alphafold.pdf","parentItem":"BGL653WD","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nature/jumper_et_al-2021-highly_accurate_protein_structure_prediction_with_alphafold.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:40:00Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:10:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/5YSENZEG","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Nature/jumper_et_al-2021-highly_accurate_protein_structure_prediction_with_alphafold.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5525/jumper_et_al-2021-highly_accurate_protein_structure_prediction_with_alphafold.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084319,"version":0},"$loki":1780},{"itemID":1110,"item":{"key":"MZT4SMVA","version":8936,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Performance of neural network basecalling tools for Oxford Nanopore sequencing","abstractNote":"Basecalling, the computational process of translating raw electrical signal to nucleotide sequence, is of critical importance to the sequencing platforms produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Here we examine the performance of different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of bases within individual reads and at majority-rules consensus basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish.Training basecallers on taxon-specific data results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences (‘polishing') with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but prepolish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy.Basecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last two years. The current version of ONT's Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with good accuracy and fast performance. If higher accuracy is required, users should consider producing a custom model using a larger neural network and/or training data from the same species.","date":"2019","extra":"Publisher: Genome Biology","volume":"20","publicationTitle":"Genome Biology","DOI":"10.1101/543439","issue":"129","creators":[{"firstName":"Ryan R.","lastName":"Wick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Louise M.","lastName":"Judd","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kathryn E.","lastName":"Holt","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"basecalling"},{"tag":"long-read sequencing"},{"tag":"oxford nanopore"}],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-30T20:19:45Z","dateModified":"2021-07-30T20:19:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/MZT4SMVA","itemID":1110,"attachments":[{"key":"3STAZR52","version":7186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"wick_judd_holt-2019-performance_of_neural_network_basecalling_tools_for_oxford_nanopore_sequencing.pdf","parentItem":"MZT4SMVA","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Genome Biology/wick_judd_holt-2019-performance_of_neural_network_basecalling_tools_for_oxford_nanopore_sequencing.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:06:23Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:12:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/3STAZR52","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Genome Biology/wick_judd_holt-2019-performance_of_neural_network_basecalling_tools_for_oxford_nanopore_sequencing.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4870/wick_judd_holt-2019-performance_of_neural_network_basecalling_tools_for_oxford_nanopore_sequencing.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084320,"version":0},"$loki":1781},{"itemID":1302,"item":{"key":"ZDYP4JKS","version":8936,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Improved protein structure prediction using potentials from deep learning","abstractNote":"Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13) — a blind assessment of the state of the field — AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction.

We find excellent qualitative and good quantitative agreement between theoretical and simulation results. Surprisingly, there emerges a threshold charge fraction of a diblock copolymer beyond which the success rate of translocation is independent of charge fraction. Also, the mean successful translocation time of a diblock copolymer displays non-monotonic behavior with increasing length of the charged block; there is an optimum length of the charged block where the mean translocation rate is the slowest; and there can be a substantial range of higher charge fractions which make the translocation slower than even a minimally charged chain.

GCN-based models provide reliable prediction performances for the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), density (ρ), and elastic modulus (E) with substantial dependence on the dataset, which is the best for Tg (R2 ∼ 0.9) and worst for E (R2 ∼ 0.5). It is found that the GCN representations for polymers provide prediction performances of their properties comparable to the popular extended-connectivity circular fingerprint (ECFP) representation. Notably, the GCN combined with the neural network regression (GCN-NN) slightly outperforms the ECFP. It is investigated how the GCN captures important structural features of polymers to learn their properties. Using the dimensionality reduction, we demonstrate that the polymers are organized in the principal subspace of the GCN representation spaces with respect to the backbone rigidity. The organization in the representation space adaptively changes with the training and through the NN layers, which might facilitate a subsequent prediction of target properties based on the relationships between the structure and the property. The GCN models are found to provide an advantage to automatically extract a backbone rigidity, strongly correlated with Tg, as well as a potential transferability to predict other properties associated with a backbone rigidity. Our results indicate both the capability and limitations of the GCN in learning to describe polymer systems depending on the property.","date":"2022","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acspolymersau.1c00050","accessDate":"2022-05-23T16:45:44Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","publicationTitle":"ACS Polymers Au","DOI":"10.1021/acspolymersau.1c00050","journalAbbreviation":"ACS Polym.

This model only receives the SMILES strings of a polymer’s repeat units as inputs and considers the SMILES strings as sequential data at the character level. Using this method, there is no need to calculate any additional molecular descriptors or fingerprints of polymers, and thereby, being very computationally efficient. More importantly, it avoids the difficulties to generate molecular descriptors for repeat units containing polymerization point ‘*’. Results show that the trained model demonstrates reasonable prediction performance on unseen polymer’s Tg. Besides, this model is further applied for high-throughput screening on an unlabeled polymer database to identify high-temperature polymers that are desired for applications in extreme environments. Our work demonstrates that the SMILES strings of polymer repeat units can be used as an effective feature representation to develop a chemical language processing model for predictions of polymer Tg. The framework of this model is general and can be used to construct structure–property relationships for other polymer properties.","date":"2021","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/13/11/1898","accessDate":"2022-05-24T15:08:26Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 11\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"13","pages":"1898","publicationTitle":"Polymers","DOI":"10.3390/polym13111898","issue":"11","ISSN":"2073-4360","creators":[{"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Tao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"glass transition temperature","type":1},{"tag":"high-throughput screening","type":1},{"tag":"polymer informatics","type":1},{"tag":"recurrent neural network","type":1}],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-05-24T15:08:26Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:58:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/47S9L3J5","itemID":2380,"attachments":[{"key":"Y6SPJV6I","version":7051,"itemType":"attachment","title":"chen_tao_li-2021-predicting_polymers’_glass_transition_temperature_by_a_chemical_language.pdf","parentItem":"47S9L3J5","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Polymers/chen_tao_li-2021-predicting_polymers’_glass_transition_temperature_by_a_chemical_language.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:29:11Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/Y6SPJV6I","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Polymers/chen_tao_li-2021-predicting_polymers’_glass_transition_temperature_by_a_chemical_language.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5215/chen_tao_li-2021-predicting_polymers’_glass_transition_temperature_by_a_chemical_language.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084323,"version":0},"$loki":1788},{"itemID":2455,"item":{"key":"5R2TNU2Q","version":11241,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Dielectric constant of aqueous solutions of proteins and organic polymers from molecular dynamics simulations","abstractNote":"The dielectric constant of water/oligomer mixtures, spanning the range from pure water to pure oligomeric melts, is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As prototypical water-soluble organic substances, we consider neutral poly-glycine, poly-ethylene glycol, and charged monomeric propionic acid. As the water content is reduced, the dielectric constant decreases but does not follow an ideal mixing behavior. The deviations from ideal mixing originate primarily in the non-linear relation between the oligomer mass fraction and collective polarization effects. We find that the dielectric constant is dominated by water polarization, even if the oligomer mass fraction exceeds 50%. By a double extrapolation of the MD simulation results to the limit of vanishing water fraction and to the limit of infinite oligomeric chain length, we estimate the orientational contribution to the dielectric constant of the pure polymeric melts. By this procedure, we obtain ɛ = 17 ± 2 for polyglycine and ɛ = 1 ± 0.3 for polyethylene glycol. The large difference is rationalized by polarization correlations of glycine units. Interestingly, we find constant temperature simulations to outperform replica exchange simulations in terms of equilibration speed.","date":"2022-06-14","libraryCatalog":"aip.scitation.org (Atypon)","url":"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0089397","accessDate":"2022-06-23T14:52:53Z","extra":"Publisher: American Institute of Physics","volume":"156","pages":"224902","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/5.0089397","issue":"22","journalAbbreviation":"J Chem Phys","ISSN":"0021-9606","creators":[{"firstName":"Susanne","lastName":"Liese","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Schlaich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roland R.","lastName":"Netz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-06-23T14:52:53Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T00:12:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/5R2TNU2Q","itemID":2455,"attachments":[{"key":"9PII4XVC","version":7440,"itemType":"attachment","title":"liese_schlaich_netz-2022-dielectric_constant_of_aqueous_solutions_of_proteins_and_organic_polymers_from.pdf","parentItem":"5R2TNU2Q","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/J Chem Phys/liese_schlaich_netz-2022-dielectric_constant_of_aqueous_solutions_of_proteins_and_organic_polymers_from.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:42:55Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:10:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/9PII4XVC","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/J Chem Phys/liese_schlaich_netz-2022-dielectric_constant_of_aqueous_solutions_of_proteins_and_organic_polymers_from.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4580/liese_schlaich_netz-2022-dielectric_constant_of_aqueous_solutions_of_proteins_and_organic_polymers_from.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084324,"version":0},"$loki":1789},{"itemID":2612,"item":{"key":"8RVTDE8N","version":9795,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sequence and entropy-based control of complex coacervates","abstractNote":"Biomacromolecules rely on the precise placement of monomers to encode information for structure, function, and physiology. Efforts to emulate this complexity via the synthetic control of chemical sequence in polymers are finding success; however, there is little understanding of how to translate monomer sequence to physical material properties. Here we establish design rules for implementing this sequence-control in materials known as complex coacervates. These materials are formed by the associative phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes into polyelectrolyte dense (coacervate) and polyelectrolyte dilute (supernatant) phases. We demonstrate that patterns of charges can profoundly affect the charge–charge associations that drive this process. Furthermore, we establish the physical origin of this pattern-dependent interaction: there is a nuanced combination of structural changes in the dense coacervate phase and a 1D confinement of counterions due to patterns along polymers in the supernatant phase.","date":"2017-11-02","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01249-1","accessDate":"2022-08-16T16:23:31Z","rights":"2017 The Author(s)","extra":"Number: 1\nPublisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"8","pages":"1273","publicationTitle":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-017-01249-1","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Commun","ISSN":"2041-1723","creators":[{"firstName":"Li-Wei","lastName":"Chang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tyler K.","lastName":"Lytle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mithun","lastName":"Radhakrishna","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jason J.","lastName":"Madinya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Vélez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Charles E.","lastName":"Sing","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sarah L.","lastName":"Perry","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Polymers","type":1},{"tag":"Self-assembly","type":1},{"tag":"Bioinspired materials","type":1},{"tag":"Chemical engineering","type":1}],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","UF75T3ZQ","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-16T16:23:31Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:58:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/8RVTDE8N","itemID":2612,"attachments":[{"key":"DFYL8P6D","version":7045,"itemType":"attachment","title":"chang_et_al-2017-sequence_and_entropy-based_control_of_complex_coacervates.pdf","parentItem":"8RVTDE8N","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nat Commun/chang_et_al-2017-sequence_and_entropy-based_control_of_complex_coacervates.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:0px\" id=\"toc\"><li><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/2\">Results</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/2\">Oppositely charged polymers drive self-assembly</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/3\">Tuning molecular interactions via patterning</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/3\">Thermodynamics of sequence-defined coacervation</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/4\">Correlations and sequence alignment in coacervation</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/5\">Tuning the entropy of counterion release</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/6\">Discussion</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:8px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/6\">Methods</a><ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding-left:12px\"><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/6\">Coacervation of sequence-controlled peptides</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/7\">Monte Carlo informed phase diagram calculations</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/7\">Data availability</a></li></ul></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/7\">References</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/8\">Acknowledgements</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/8\">Author contributions</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/8\">Competing interests</a></li><li style=\"padding-top:4px\"><a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/0_DFYL8P6D/8\">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</a></li></ul>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:40:41Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/DFYL8P6D","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Nat Commun/chang_et_al-2017-sequence_and_entropy-based_control_of_complex_coacervates.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4556/chang_et_al-2017-sequence_and_entropy-based_control_of_complex_coacervates.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084325,"version":0},"$loki":1790},{"itemID":2751,"item":{"key":"AQGJ639Q","version":8936,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Machine Learning Predictions of Block Copolymer Self-Assembly","abstractNote":"Directed self-assembly of block copolymers is a key enabler for nanofabrication of devices with sub-10 nm feature sizes, allowing patterning far below the resolution limit of conventional photolithography. Among all the process steps involved in block copolymer self-assembly, solvent annealing plays a dominant role in determining the film morphology and pattern quality, yet the interplay of the multiple parameters during solvent annealing, including the initial thickness, swelling, time, and solvent ratio, makes it difficult to predict and control the resultant self-assembled pattern. Here, machine learning tools are applied to analyze the solvent annealing process and predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity. Two neural networks are constructed and trained, yielding accurate prediction of the final morphology in agreement with experimental data. A ridge regression model is constructed to identify the critical parameters that determine the quality of line/space patterns. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning to inform nanomanufacturing processes.","date":"2020","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202005713","accessDate":"2022-08-24T15:16:00Z","extra":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adma.202005713","volume":"32","pages":"2005713","publicationTitle":"Advanced Materials","DOI":"10.1002/adma.202005713","issue":"52","ISSN":"1521-4095","creators":[{"firstName":"Kun-Hua","lastName":"Tu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hejin","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sangho","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wonmoo","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zehao","lastName":"Sun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Alexander-Katz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Caroline A.","lastName":"Ross","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"self-assembly","type":1},{"tag":"machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"block copolymers","type":1},{"tag":"nanomanufacturing","type":1},{"tag":"ridge regression","type":1}],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-24T15:16:00Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:58:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/AQGJ639Q","itemID":2751,"attachments":[{"key":"27XNTAX9","version":7179,"itemType":"attachment","title":"tu_et_al-2020-machine_learning_predictions_of_block_copolymer_self-assembly.pdf","parentItem":"AQGJ639Q","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Advanced Materials/tu_et_al-2020-machine_learning_predictions_of_block_copolymer_self-assembly.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:26:49Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:12:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/27XNTAX9","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Advanced Materials/tu_et_al-2020-machine_learning_predictions_of_block_copolymer_self-assembly.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5165/tu_et_al-2020-machine_learning_predictions_of_block_copolymer_self-assembly.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084326,"version":0},"$loki":1791},{"itemID":2754,"item":{"key":"6GITMAVG","version":8936,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Machine learning strategies for the structure-property relationship of copolymers","abstractNote":"Establishing the structure-property relationship is extremely valuable for the molecular design of copolymers. However, machine learning (ML) models can incorporate both chemical composition and sequence distribution of monomers, and have the generalization ability to process various copolymer types (e.g., alternating, random, block, and gradient copolymers) with a unified approach are missing. To address this challenge, we formulate four different ML models for investigation, including a feedforward neural network (FFNN) model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, and a combined FFNN/RNN (Fusion) model. We use various copolymer types to systematically validate the performance and generalizability of different models. We find that the RNN architecture that processes the monomer sequence information both forward and backward is a more suitable ML model for copolymers with better generalizability. As a supplement to polymer informatics, our proposed approach provides an efficient way for the evaluation of copolymers.","date":"2022-07-15","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222008574","accessDate":"2022-08-24T15:16:05Z","volume":"25","pages":"104585","publicationTitle":"iScience","DOI":"10.1016/j.isci.2022.104585","issue":"7","journalAbbreviation":"iScience","ISSN":"2589-0042","creators":[{"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Tao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Byrnes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vikas","lastName":"Varshney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Polymers","type":1},{"tag":"Artificial intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"Materials science","type":1}],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-24T15:16:05Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:58:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/6GITMAVG","itemID":2754,"attachments":[{"key":"PGIKFUVX","version":7176,"itemType":"attachment","title":"tao_et_al-2022-machine_learning_strategies_for_the_structure-property_relationship_of.pdf","parentItem":"6GITMAVG","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/iScience/tao_et_al-2022-machine_learning_strategies_for_the_structure-property_relationship_of.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:42:50Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:12:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/PGIKFUVX","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/iScience/tao_et_al-2022-machine_learning_strategies_for_the_structure-property_relationship_of.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5591/tao_et_al-2022-machine_learning_strategies_for_the_structure-property_relationship_of.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084326,"version":0},"$loki":1792},{"itemID":2757,"item":{"key":"7LRJZG5D","version":8937,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Polymer informatics with multi-task learning","abstractNote":"Modern data-driven tools are transforming application-specific polymer development cycles.

Nevertheless, these models do not utilize the full breadth of the knowledge available in datasets, which are oftentimes sparse; inherent correlations between different property datasets are disregarded. Here, we demonstrate the potency of multi-task learning approaches that exploit such inherent correlations effectively. Data pertaining to 36 different properties of over 13,000 polymers are supplied to deep-learning multi-task architectures. Compared to conventional single-task learning models, the multi-task approach is accurate, efficient, scalable, and amenable to transfer learning as more data on the same or different properties become available. Moreover, these models are interpretable. Chemical rules, that explain how certain features control trends in property values, emerge from the present work, paving the way for the rational design of application specific polymers meeting desired property or performance objectives.","date":"2021-04-09","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921000581","accessDate":"2022-08-24T15:16:08Z","volume":"2","pages":"100238","publicationTitle":"Patterns","DOI":"10.1016/j.patter.2021.100238","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Patterns","ISSN":"2666-3899","creators":[{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Kuenneth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arunkumar Chitteth","lastName":"Rajan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Tran","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chiho","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rampi","lastName":"Ramprasad","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"neural network","type":1},{"tag":"polymer informatics","type":1},{"tag":"data-driven methods","type":1},{"tag":"Gaussian processing","type":1},{"tag":"multi-task","type":1},{"tag":"polymer design","type":1},{"tag":"polymer property of prediction","type":1}],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-08-24T15:16:08Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:58:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/7LRJZG5D","itemID":2757,"attachments":[{"key":"JK8MIYY2","version":7098,"itemType":"attachment","title":"kuenneth_et_al-2021-polymer_informatics_with_multi-task_learning.pdf","parentItem":"7LRJZG5D","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Patterns/kuenneth_et_al-2021-polymer_informatics_with_multi-task_learning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:26:41Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:10:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/JK8MIYY2","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Patterns/kuenneth_et_al-2021-polymer_informatics_with_multi-task_learning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5163/kuenneth_et_al-2021-polymer_informatics_with_multi-task_learning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084327,"version":0},"$loki":1793},{"itemID":2759,"item":{"key":"BSCUG7E5","version":8937,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Copolymer Informatics with Multitask Deep Neural Networks","abstractNote":"Polymer informatics tools have been recently gaining ground to efficiently and effectively develop, design, and discover new polymers that meet specific application needs.

Advanced polymer fingerprinting and deep-learning schemes that incorporate multitask learning and meta learning are proposed.

To confirm that the prepared data can be discriminated using DL, image classification was performed using the VGG-16 network. We comprehensively investigated the performances of the learned networks in the regression problem. The generalization ability was evaluated from independent images with the unlearned χN. We found that, except for large χN values, the standard deviation values were approximately 0.1 and 0.5 for A-component fractions of 0.2 and 0.35, respectively. The images for larger χN values were more difficult to distinguish. In addition, the learning performances for the 4-class problem were comparable to those for the 8-class problem, except when the χN values were large. This information is useful for the analysis of real experimental image data, where the variation of samples is

decades as ultrasensitive analytical tools for individual molecules. In particular, nanopore-based single-molecule DNA/RNA sequencing has advanced genomic and transcriptomic research due to the portability, lower costs and long reads of these methods. Nanopore applications, however, extend far beyond nucleic acid sequencing. In this Review, we present an overview of the broad applications of nanopores in molecular sensing and sequencing, chemical catalysis and biophysical characterization. We highlight the prospects of applying nanopores for single-protein analysis and sequencing, single-molecule covalent chemistry, clinical sensing applications for single-molecule liquid biopsy, and the use of synthetic biomimetic nanopores as experimental models for natural systems. We suggest that nanopore technologies will continue to be explored to address a number of scientific challenges as control over pore design improves.","date":"2022-09-26","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-022-01193-2","accessDate":"2022-09-28T15:24:47Z","rights":"2022 Springer Nature Limited","extra":"Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","pages":"1-11","publicationTitle":"Nature Nanotechnology","DOI":"10.1038/s41565-022-01193-2","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Nanotechnol","ISSN":"1748-3395","creators":[{"firstName":"Yi-Lun","lastName":"Ying","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zheng-Li","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shengli","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yujia","lastName":"Qing","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Fragasso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Maglia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Meller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hagan","lastName":"Bayley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cees","lastName":"Dekker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yi-Tao","lastName":"Long","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Nanopores","type":1},{"tag":"Biosensors","type":1}],"collections":["BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-28T15:24:47Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T23:42:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/XY7FZE2B","itemID":2906,"attachments":[{"key":"9ICTG3FH","version":7356,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ying_et_al-2022-nanopore-based_technologies_beyond_dna_sequencing.pdf","parentItem":"XY7FZE2B","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nat Nanotechnol/ying_et_al-2022-nanopore-based_technologies_beyond_dna_sequencing.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:24:43Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:12:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/9ICTG3FH","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Nat Nanotechnol/ying_et_al-2022-nanopore-based_technologies_beyond_dna_sequencing.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5141/ying_et_al-2022-nanopore-based_technologies_beyond_dna_sequencing.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084330,"version":0},"$loki":1800},{"itemID":2935,"item":{"key":"TADUUBT2","version":11270,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Collapse of Linear Polyelectrolyte Chains in a Poor Solvent: When Does a Collapsing Polyelectrolyte Collect its Counterions?","abstractNote":"To better understand the collapse of polyions in poor solvent conditions the effective charge and the solvent quality of the hypothetically uncharged polymer backbone need to be known. In the present work this is achieved by utilizing poly-2-vinylpyridine quaternized to 4.3% with ethylbromide. Conductivity and light scattering measurements were utilized to study the polyion collapse in isorefractive solvent/nonsolvent mixtures consisting of 1-propanol and 2-pentanone, respectively, at nearly constant dielectric constant. The solvent quality of the uncharged polyion could be quantified which, for the first time, allowed the experimental investigation of the effect of the electrostatic interaction prior and during polyion collapse, by comparing to a newly developed theory. Although the Manning parameter for the investigated system is as low as lB/l = 0.6 (lB is the Bjerrum length and l is the mean contour distance between two charges), that is, no counterion binding should occur, a qualitative interpretation of the conductivity data revealed that the polyion chain already collects its counterions when the dimensions start to shrink below the good solvent limit but are still well above the θ-dimension.","date":"2008-12-09","shortTitle":"Collapse of Linear Polyelectrolyte Chains in a Poor Solvent","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ma8014239","accessDate":"2022-10-12T19:29:36Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"41","pages":"9352-9358","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/ma8014239","issue":"23","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Loh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"G.

Muthukumar, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 9343 (2004)] that considers the Bjerrum length, salt concentration, and local dielectric heterogeneity as physical variables in the system. Self-consistent calculations of effective charge and size of the polymer show that divalent counterions replace condensed monovalent counterions in competitive adsorption. The theory further predicts that at modest physical conditions for a flexible polyelectrolytes such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate in aqueous solutions polymer charge is compensated and reversed with increasing divalent salt. Consequently, the polyelectrolyte shrinks and reswells. Lower temperatures and higher degrees of dielectric heterogeneity between chain backbone and solvent enhance condensation of all species of ions. Complete diagrams of states for the effective charge calculated as functions of the Coulomb strength and salt concentration suggest that (a) overcharging requires a minimum Coulomb strength and (b) progressively higher presence of salt recharges the polymer due to either electrostatic screening (for low Coulomb strengths) or coion condensation (for high Coulomb strengths). Consideration of ion-bridging by divalent counterions leads to a first-order collapse of polyelectrolytes in modest presence of divalent salts and at higher Coulomb strengths. The authors’ theoretical predictions are in agreement with the generic results from experiments and simulations.","date":"2008-06-28","shortTitle":"Theory of competitive counterion adsorption on flexible polyelectrolytes","libraryCatalog":"aip.scitation.org (Atypon)","url":"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2940199","accessDate":"2022-10-12T19:29:43Z","extra":"Publisher: American Institute of Physics","volume":"128","pages":"244901","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.2940199","issue":"24","journalAbbreviation":"J Chem Phys","ISSN":"0021-9606","creators":[{"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Kundagrami","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Muthukumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["PCWHMZDA","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-10-12T19:29:51Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T00:10:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/G3RPD3II","itemID":2941,"attachments":[{"key":"AGZSC5ER","version":7440,"itemType":"attachment","title":"kundagrami_muthukumar-2008-theory_of_competitive_counterion_adsorption_on_flexible_polyelectrolytes.pdf","parentItem":"G3RPD3II","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/J Chem Phys/kundagrami_muthukumar-2008-theory_of_competitive_counterion_adsorption_on_flexible_polyelectrolytes.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:37:40Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:10:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/AGZSC5ER","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/J Chem Phys/kundagrami_muthukumar-2008-theory_of_competitive_counterion_adsorption_on_flexible_polyelectrolytes.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4517/kundagrami_muthukumar-2008-theory_of_competitive_counterion_adsorption_on_flexible_polyelectrolytes.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084331,"version":0},"$loki":1802},{"itemID":2965,"item":{"key":"GMRHRTIE","version":8937,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Advances in nanopore direct RNA sequencing","abstractNote":"Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) reads continuous native RNA strands.

Here, we show that the sequence and length of single-stranded DNA directly influence the self-assembly of sequence-defined DNA block copolymers. While increasing the length of DNA led to predictable changes in self-assembly, changing only the sequence of DNA produced three distinct structures: spherical micelles (spherical nucleic acids, SNAs) from flexible poly(thymine) DNA, fibers from semirigid mixed-sequence DNA, and networked superstructures from rigid poly(adenine) DNA. The secondary structure of poly(adenine) DNA strands drives a temperature-dependent polymerization and assembly mechanism: copolymers stored in an SNA reservoir form fibers after thermal activation, which then aggregate upon cooling to form interwoven networks. DNA is often used as a programming code that aids in nanostructure addressability and function. Here, we show that the inherent physical and chemical properties of single-stranded DNA sequences also make them an ideal material to direct self-assembled morphologies and select for new methods of supramolecular polymerization.","date":"2022-07-13","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c03506","accessDate":"2022-12-09T13:55:25Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"144","pages":"12272-12279","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","DOI":"10.1021/jacs.2c03506","issue":"27","journalAbbreviation":"J.

However, accurately and efficiently capturing polymers’ complex, periodic structures in machine learning models remains a grand challenge for the polymer cheminformatics community. Specifically, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymers, as well as how to optimally develop polymer descriptors without requiring human-based feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems by utilizing a periodic polymer graph representation that accounts for polymers’ periodicity and coupling it with a message-passing neural network that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically relevant polymer descriptors. Remarkably, this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 10 distinct polymer property prediction tasks. These results highlight the advancement in predictive capability that is possible through learning descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.","date":"2022-11-28","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00875","accessDate":"2022-12-16T15:16:07Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"62","pages":"5435-5445","publicationTitle":"Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00875","issue":"22","journalAbbreviation":"J.

However, L-FTS is a computationally expensive tool, and it may take more than a week to accurately calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic quantities. In our previous study, we introduced a deep neural network (DNN) that estimates the saddle point of the pressure field to reduce the subsequent Anderson mixing (AM) iterations. Herein, we propose a novel DNN that can be successively applied to determine the saddle point without using conventional field-update algorithms. Major deep learning (DL) models for semantic segmentation in computer vision are adopted to construct the optimal DNN architecture. Our model utilizing atrous convolutions in parallel is accurate and computationally efficient, and it is robust to the simulation parameter changes and can consequently be reused after single training. We demonstrate that our DNN can achieve speedup of factor 6 or more compared to the AM method without affecting accuracy.

Given their primordial relevance, peptide-RNA coacervates may have also been a key site of early protein evolution. However, the extent to which such coacervates might promote or suppress the exploration of novel peptide conformations is fundamentally unknown. To this end, we used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) to characterize the structure and dynamics of an ancient and ubiquitous nucleic acid binding element, the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif, alone and in the presence of RNA, with which it forms coacervates. Double electron–electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy applied to singly labeled peptides containing one HhH motif revealed the presence of dimers, even in the absence of RNA. Moreover, dimer formation is promoted upon RNA binding and was detectable within peptide-RNA coacervates. DEER measurements of spin-diluted, doubly labeled peptides in solution indicated transient α-helical character. The distance distributions between spin labels in the dimer and the signatures of α-helical folding are consistent with the symmetric (HhH)2-Fold, which is generated upon duplication and fusion of a single HhH motif and traditionally associated with dsDNA binding. These results support the hypothesis that coacervates are a unique testing ground for peptide oligomerization and that phase-separating peptides could have been a resource for the construction of complex protein structures via common evolutionary processes, such as duplication and fusion.","date":"2022-08-10","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c03819","accessDate":"2022-12-20T23:45:13Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"144","pages":"14150-14160","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","DOI":"10.1021/jacs.2c03819","issue":"31","journalAbbreviation":"J.

We develop a theory for complexation of two oppositely charged PEs, a process known to be the precursor to the formation of complex coacervates in PE solutions, to explore the underlying thermodynamics of complex formation, at low salts. The theory considers general degrees of solvent polarity and dielectricity within an implicit solvent model, incorporating a varying Coulomb strength. Explicit calculation of the free energy of complexation and its components indicates that the entropy of free counterions and salt ions and the Coulomb enthalpy of bound ion-pairs dictate the equilibrium of PE complexation. This helps decouple the self-consistent dependency of charge and size of the uncomplexed parts of the polyions, derive an analytical expression for charge, and evaluate the free energy components as functions of chain overlap. Complexation is observed to be driven by enthalpy gain at low Coulomb strengths, driven by entropy gain of released counterions but opposed by enthalpy loss due to reduction of ion-pairs at moderate Coulomb strengths, and progressively less favorable due to enthalpy loss at even higher Coulomb strengths. The total free energy of the system is found to decrease linearly with an overlap of chains. Thermodynamic predictions from our model are in good quantitative agreement with simulations in literature.","date":"2023-01-07","shortTitle":"Polyelectrolyte complexation of two oppositely charged symmetric polymers","libraryCatalog":"aip.scitation.org (Atypon)","url":"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0128904","accessDate":"2023-01-05T15:41:14Z","extra":"Publisher: American Institute of Physics","volume":"158","pages":"014904","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/5.0128904","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"J Chem Phys","ISSN":"0021-9606","creators":[{"firstName":"Soumik","lastName":"Mitra","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Kundagrami","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-01-05T15:41:14Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T00:12:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/JA4U8CE9","itemID":3110,"attachments":[{"key":"EA2IUTAT","version":7439,"itemType":"attachment","title":"mitra_kundagrami-2023-polyelectrolyte_complexation_of_two_oppositely_charged_symmetric_polymers.pdf","parentItem":"JA4U8CE9","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/J Chem Phys/mitra_kundagrami-2023-polyelectrolyte_complexation_of_two_oppositely_charged_symmetric_polymers.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:34:58Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/EA2IUTAT","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/J Chem Phys/mitra_kundagrami-2023-polyelectrolyte_complexation_of_two_oppositely_charged_symmetric_polymers.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4489/mitra_kundagrami-2023-polyelectrolyte_complexation_of_two_oppositely_charged_symmetric_polymers.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084334,"version":0},"$loki":1809},{"itemID":3117,"item":{"key":"D99LD8NG","version":9946,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System","abstractNote":"Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method.

Recent advances in the sequence control of traditional copolymers, such as polyethylenes and polystyrenes, have led to well controlled primary structures ranging from periodic to more precise sequences. As a result, this unprecedented control in the chemical structure of the polymer has necessitated a reexamination of the role of monomer sequence on polymer properties, such as crystallization and self-assembly. In this review, we summarize the developments in establishing a relationship between a polymer’s sequence and its properties, and we focus on one sequence-specific polymer system in particular: N-substituted glycines, or polypeptoids. Polypeptoid self-assembly has demonstrated remarkably tunable, hierarchical structures, and through this lens, we look to the future “designability” of sequence-specific polymers in general.","date":"2013-08-14","language":"en","shortTitle":"Polypeptoids","libraryCatalog":"pubs.rsc.org","url":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/sm/c3sm51421h","accessDate":"2023-03-24T15:49:06Z","extra":"Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry","volume":"9","pages":"8400-8414","publicationTitle":"Soft Matter","DOI":"10.1039/C3SM51421H","issue":"35","journalAbbreviation":"Soft Matter","ISSN":"1744-6848","creators":[{"firstName":"Adrianne M.","lastName":"Rosales","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rachel A.","lastName":"Segalman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ronald N.","lastName":"Zuckermann","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/RHIWVWCN"]},"dateAdded":"2023-03-24T15:49:06Z","dateModified":"2024-05-07T14:53:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/UVEACYXK","itemID":3131,"attachments":[{"key":"3NBJD687","version":8358,"itemType":"attachment","title":"rosales_segalman_zuckermann-2013-polypeptoids.pdf","parentItem":"UVEACYXK","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Soft Matter/rosales_segalman_zuckermann-2013-polypeptoids.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

(2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model’s performance over time.

The theory describes coil-globule transition for a given protein sequence when temperature is varied and has been benchmarked against the all-atom Monte Carlo simulation (using CAMPARI) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In addition, the model quantitatively shows how subtle alterations of charge placement in the primary sequence—while maintaining the same charge composition—can lead to significant changes in conformation, even as drastic as a coil (swelled above a purely random coil) to globule (collapsed below a random coil) and vice versa. The theory provides insights on how to control (enhance or suppress) these changes by tuning the temperature (or solution condition) and charge decoration. As an application, we predict the distribution of conformations (at room temperature) of all naturally occurring IDPs in the DisProt database and notice significant size variation even among IDPs with a similar composition of positive and negative charges. Based on this, we provide a new diagram-of-states delineating the sequence-conformation relation for proteins in the DisProt database. Next, we study the effect of post-translational modification, e.g., phosphorylation, on IDP conformations. Modifications as little as two-site phosphorylation can significantly alter the size of an IDP with everything else being constant (temperature, salt concentration, etc.). However, not all possible modification sites have the same effect on protein conformations; there are certain “hot spots” that can cause maximal change in conformation. The location of these “hot spots” in the parent sequence can readily be identified by using a sequence charge decoration metric originally introduced by Sawle and Ghosh. The ability of our model to predict conformations (both expanded and collapsed states) of IDPs at a high-throughput level can provide valuable insights into the different mechanisms by which phosphorylation/charge mutation controls IDP function.","date":"2017-11-27","libraryCatalog":"Silverchair","url":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5005821","accessDate":"2023-09-11T18:29:25Z","volume":"148","pages":"123305","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.5005821","issue":"12","journalAbbreviation":"J Chem Phys","ISSN":"0021-9606","creators":[{"firstName":"Taylor","lastName":"Firman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kingshuk","lastName":"Ghosh","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-09-11T18:29:25Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T00:11:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/TKZTGW5B","itemID":3176,"attachments":[{"key":"LDP4SMUV","version":7439,"itemType":"attachment","title":"firman_ghosh-2017-sequence_charge_decoration_dictates_coil-globule_transition_in_intrinsically.pdf","parentItem":"TKZTGW5B","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/J Chem Phys/firman_ghosh-2017-sequence_charge_decoration_dictates_coil-globule_transition_in_intrinsically.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:33:54Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:09:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/LDP4SMUV","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/J Chem Phys/firman_ghosh-2017-sequence_charge_decoration_dictates_coil-globule_transition_in_intrinsically.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4477/firman_ghosh-2017-sequence_charge_decoration_dictates_coil-globule_transition_in_intrinsically.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084338,"version":0},"$loki":1819},{"itemID":3197,"item":{"key":"NSQ2DL2L","version":10533,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sequence Dependence of Conformations of Polyampholytes","date":"1996-01-01","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ma951204g","accessDate":"2023-09-19T19:10:18Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"29","pages":"2324-2326","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/ma951204g","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Devesh","lastName":"Srivastava","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Muthukumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/9MZG2UV7"]},"dateAdded":"2023-09-19T19:10:18Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T21:26:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/NSQ2DL2L","itemID":3197,"attachments":[{"key":"E2PUWG5S","version":7170,"itemType":"attachment","title":"srivastava_muthukumar-1996-sequence_dependence_of_conformations_of_polyampholytes.pdf","parentItem":"NSQ2DL2L","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/srivastava_muthukumar-1996-sequence_dependence_of_conformations_of_polyampholytes.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T21:24:58Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:12:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/E2PUWG5S","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/srivastava_muthukumar-1996-sequence_dependence_of_conformations_of_polyampholytes.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5883/srivastava_muthukumar-1996-sequence_dependence_of_conformations_of_polyampholytes.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084339,"version":0},"$loki":1821},{"itemID":3216,"item":{"key":"9TK33K2P","version":10878,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Hydrogen-bonds mediate liquid-liquid phase separation of mussel derived adhesive peptides","abstractNote":"Marine mussels achieve strong underwater adhesion by depositing mussel foot proteins (Mfps) that form coacervates during the protein secretion. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the phase separation behaviors of the Mfps are still not fully understood. Here, we report that GK-16*, a peptide derived from the primary adhesive protein Mfp-5, forms coacervate in seawater conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with point mutation experiments demonstrate that Dopa- and Gly- mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions are essential in the coacervation process. The properties of GK-16* coacervates could be controlled by tuning the strength of the electrostatic and Dopa-mediated hydrogen bond interactions via controlling the pH and salt concentration of the solution. The GK-16* coacervate undergoes a pH induced liquid-to-gel transition, which can be utilized for the underwater delivery and curing of the adhesives. Our study provides useful molecular design principles for the development of mussel-inspired peptidyl coacervate adhesives with tunable properties.","date":"2022-10-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33545-w","accessDate":"2023-10-02T21:32:54Z","rights":"2022 The Author(s)","extra":"Number: 1\nPublisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"13","pages":"5771","publicationTitle":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-022-33545-w","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Commun","ISSN":"2041-1723","creators":[{"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Guo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guijin","lastName":"Zou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Xuliang","lastName":"Qian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shujun","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Huajian","lastName":"Gao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bioinspired materials","type":1},{"tag":"Fluids","type":1},{"tag":"Mechanical properties","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-10-02T21:32:54Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:57:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/9TK33K2P","itemID":3216,"attachments":[{"key":"XRKILC6X","version":7076,"itemType":"attachment","title":"guo_et_al-2022-hydrogen-bonds_mediate_liquid-liquid_phase_separation_of_mussel_derived.pdf","parentItem":"9TK33K2P","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nat Commun/guo_et_al-2022-hydrogen-bonds_mediate_liquid-liquid_phase_separation_of_mussel_derived.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:33:11Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:09:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/XRKILC6X","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Nat Commun/guo_et_al-2022-hydrogen-bonds_mediate_liquid-liquid_phase_separation_of_mussel_derived.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4469/guo_et_al-2022-hydrogen-bonds_mediate_liquid-liquid_phase_separation_of_mussel_derived.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084339,"version":0},"$loki":1822},{"itemID":3284,"item":{"key":"YUC73SLS","version":10533,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Specific Chemical Difference Between the Globins of Normal Human and Sickle-Cell Anæmia Hæmoglobin","date":"1956-10","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/178792a0","accessDate":"2023-11-01T17:26:11Z","rights":"1956 Springer Nature Limited","extra":"Number: 4537\nPublisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"178","pages":"792-794","publicationTitle":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/178792a0","issue":"4537","ISSN":"1476-4687","creators":[{"firstName":"V.

Although the structure of the protein capsid is known for many virus species1,2, the three-dimensional organization of viral genomes has mostly eluded experimental probes3,4. Here we report all-atom structural models of an HK97 virion5, including its entire 39,732 base pair genome, obtained through multiresolution simulations. Mimicking the action of a packaging motor6, the genome was gradually loaded into the capsid. The structure of the packaged capsid was then refined through simulations of increasing resolution, which produced a 26 million atom model of the complete virion, including water and ions confined within the capsid. DNA packaging occurs through a loop extrusion mechanism7 that produces globally different configurations of the packaged genome and gives each viral particle individual traits. Multiple microsecond-long all-atom simulations characterized the effect of the packaged genome on capsid structure, internal pressure, electrostatics and diffusion of water, ions and DNA, and revealed the structural imprints of the capsid onto the genome. Our approach can be generalized to obtain complete all-atom structural models of other virus species, thereby potentially revealing new drug targets at the genome–capsid interface.","date":"2024-03-06","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07150-4","accessDate":"2024-03-11T20:21:14Z","rights":"2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","extra":"Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","pages":"1-10","publicationTitle":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-024-07150-4","ISSN":"1476-4687","creators":[{"firstName":"Kush","lastName":"Coshic","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Maffeo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Winogradoff","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aleksei","lastName":"Aksimentiev","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computational biophysics","type":1},{"tag":"Biological physics","type":1},{"tag":"Nanoscale biophysics","type":1},{"tag":"Phage biology","type":1},{"tag":"Supramolecular assembly","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-11T20:21:14Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T14:57:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/Y2GDE7H4","itemID":3367,"attachments":[{"key":"P6BU4CXZ","version":7044,"itemType":"attachment","title":"coshic_et_al-2024-the_structure_and_physical_properties_of_a_packaged_bacteriophage_particle.pdf","parentItem":"Y2GDE7H4","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nature/coshic_et_al-2024-the_structure_and_physical_properties_of_a_packaged_bacteriophage_particle.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:29:53Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:09:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/P6BU4CXZ","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Nature/coshic_et_al-2024-the_structure_and_physical_properties_of_a_packaged_bacteriophage_particle.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4429/coshic_et_al-2024-the_structure_and_physical_properties_of_a_packaged_bacteriophage_particle.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084340,"version":0},"$loki":1824},{"itemID":3378,"item":{"key":"BCJQKQBD","version":11295,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Molecular Crowding: The History and Development of a Scientific Paradigm","abstractNote":"It is now generally accepted that macromolecules do not act in isolation but “live” in a crowded environment, that is, an environment populated by numerous different molecules.

Here, we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning–based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25° resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems.","date":"2023-12-22","libraryCatalog":"science.org (Atypon)","url":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2336","accessDate":"2024-03-20T21:22:02Z","extra":"Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","volume":"382","pages":"1416-1421","publicationTitle":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.adi2336","issue":"6677","creators":[{"firstName":"Remi","lastName":"Lam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alvaro","lastName":"Sanchez-Gonzalez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Willson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Wirnsberger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Meire","lastName":"Fortunato","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ferran","lastName":"Alet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Ravuri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Ewalds","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zach","lastName":"Eaton-Rosen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Merose","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Hoyer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"George","lastName":"Holland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oriol","lastName":"Vinyals","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jacklynn","lastName":"Stott","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Pritzel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shakir","lastName":"Mohamed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Battaglia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/MXWFLXKU"]},"dateAdded":"2023-11-15T20:14:42Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T21:27:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/QZBW2MAF","itemID":5842,"attachments":[{"key":"5PAJIALF","version":7101,"itemType":"attachment","title":"lam_et_al-2023-learning_skillful_medium-range_global_weather_forecasting.pdf","parentItem":"QZBW2MAF","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Science/lam_et_al-2023-learning_skillful_medium-range_global_weather_forecasting.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T21:22:06Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:10:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/5PAJIALF","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Science/lam_et_al-2023-learning_skillful_medium-range_global_weather_forecasting.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5844/lam_et_al-2023-learning_skillful_medium-range_global_weather_forecasting.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084342,"version":0},"$loki":1827},{"itemID":5919,"item":{"key":"QG6E4N8F","version":8938,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Investigating the Effects of Charge Arrangement in Stimuli-Responsive Polyelectrolytes","abstractNote":"The transition from self-coacervation to complex coacervation of a series of charge-balanced polyampholyte (PA) and polyelectrolyte (PE) pairs based on the copolymers of methacrylic acid and N-(3-aminopropyl) methacrylamide hydrochloride is described, with focus on the effects of charge distribution on coacervate properties. Turbidimetric pH titration was used to compare the response of different charge-balanced coacervates to changes in pH. At high molecular weight, resistance to stimuli such as ionic strength and pH increased from the liquid self-coacervate formed from the stoichiometric PA, through complex coacervates formed from complementary nonstoichiometric PAs, to less hydrated coacervates or precipitates formed from two PE homopolymers. In addition, optical microscopy was used to map the compositional regions as a function of ionic strength corresponding to liquid–liquid phase separation by both self- and complex coacervation and liquid–solid phase separation or precipitation. Coacervates were thermally responsive and showed lower critical solution temperatures that were sensitive to composition and ionic strength. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to explore the energetics of complexation for select complex coacervates, confirming that complexation is dominated by an entropic contribution. Coacervate droplets were shown to reversibly bind ionic dyes and thus have potential use as drug release systems. The coacervate droplets also reacted with genipin to form cross-linked coacervate microgels.

These molecules have many applications associated with their natural biocompatibility and their propensity to form viscoelastic fluids and gels due to their common tendency to form self-assembled structures in solution. Recently, advances in the synthesis capabilities have enabled the fine-tuning of the monomer structure and composition, such as the sequence and ratio of the charged and hydrophobic groups. We correspondingly investigate these molecular characteristics on the solution properties of a series of poly(carbonate)-based polyampholytes using both molecular dynamics simulations and small-angle neutron scattering measurements. Our simulations suggest the importance of hydrophobic groups for understanding the observed properties of our polyampholyte solutions, a well-known fact for protein solutions. In particular, our simulations indicate that the hydrophobic groups cause the polyampholyte chains to form compact micelle-like rather than diffuse clusters at low concentrations and greatly influence the concentration dependence of the correlation peak in the structure factor describing the correlation distance between the polyampholyte chains in solution. We also construct a polyampholyte solution association map where the polymer concentration and charge ratios lead to different propensities of association (or clustering) and determine a self-assembly boundary governing the transition between self-assembled clusters that resemble micelles and a transient polymer network that percolates the system.","date":"2022-08-09","shortTitle":"Combined Simulation and Experimental Study of Polyampholyte Solution Properties","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00977","accessDate":"2024-03-20T21:30:36Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"55","pages":"6750-6761","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00977","issue":"15","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Wengang","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuanchi","lastName":"Ma","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicholas D.","lastName":"Posey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael J.","lastName":"Lueckheide","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vivek M.","lastName":"Prabhu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jack F.","lastName":"Douglas","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/XYSWW9TT"]},"dateAdded":"2022-12-16T15:46:27Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T21:32:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/JFCQZ8IN","itemID":5928,"attachments":[{"key":"TAKN38A5","version":7199,"itemType":"attachment","title":"zhang_et_al-2022-combined_simulation_and_experimental_study_of_polyampholyte_solution_properties.pdf","parentItem":"JFCQZ8IN","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/zhang_et_al-2022-combined_simulation_and_experimental_study_of_polyampholyte_solution_properties.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T21:30:51Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:12:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/TAKN38A5","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/zhang_et_al-2022-combined_simulation_and_experimental_study_of_polyampholyte_solution_properties.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5939/zhang_et_al-2022-combined_simulation_and_experimental_study_of_polyampholyte_solution_properties.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084348,"version":0},"$loki":1829},{"itemID":5940,"item":{"key":"E896DUBB","version":8938,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Complex coacervation of statistical polyelectrolytes: role of monomer sequences and formation of inhomogeneous coacervates","abstractNote":"Advances in synthetic chemistry have led to greater control over the sequence of polymeric materials, and the ability to create patterns whose complexity is reminiscent of that of biological macromolecules. In random copolymers synthesized via statistical copolymerization, the sequence follows a first-order Markov chain process governed by the underlying reactivity ratios. In this work, theory and simulations are combined to study the role of sequence in the complex coacervation of oppositely charged random (co)polyelectrolytes, i.e. copolymers comprising cationic/anionic and neutral monomers. It is found that charged monomers enhance the proclivity towards complex coacervation, and enhance the coacervates' stability upon addition of salt. This result is general, and holds for both good and poor solvents, despite the different (“closed” and “open”) shapes of the respective coacervation binodals. For high charge blockiness, simulations reveal the formation of microphase separated coacervates consisting of domains rich in ionic or neutral monomers. The transition from homogeneous to locally segregated coacervates leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the density on charge blockiness. Our results provide a comprehensive framework to understand and interpret the effects of sequence on complex coacervation, and for rational design of coacervate-based materials.","date":"2021-10-04","language":"en","shortTitle":"Complex coacervation of statistical polyelectrolytes","libraryCatalog":"pubs.rsc.org","url":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/me/d1me00076d","accessDate":"2024-03-20T21:30:53Z","extra":"Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry","volume":"6","pages":"790-804","publicationTitle":"Molecular Systems Design & Engineering","DOI":"10.1039/D1ME00076D","issue":"10","journalAbbreviation":"Mol.

However, the successful use of self-consistent field theory (SCFT) for designing new materials relies on the correct chemistry- and temperature-dependent Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χAB that quantifies the incompatibility between the two blocks A and B as well as accurate estimation of the ratio of Kuhn lengths (bA/bB) and block densities. This work uses machine learning to model the phase behavior of AB diblock copolymers by using the chemical identities of blocks directly, obviating the need for measurement of χAB and bA/bB. The random forest approach employed predicts the phase behavior with almost 90% accuracy after training on a data set of 4768 data points, almost twice the accuracy obtained using SCFT employing χAB from group contribution theory. The machine-learning model is notably sensitive toward the uncertainty in measuring molecular parameters; however, its accuracy still remains at least 60% even for highly uncertain experimental measurements. Accuracy is substantially reduced when extrapolating to chemistries outside the training set. This work demonstrates that a random forest phase predictor performs remarkably well in many scenarios, providing an opportunity to predict self-assembly without measurement of molecular parameters.","date":"2021-11-16","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmacrolett.1c00521","accessDate":"2024-03-20T21:46:24Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"10","pages":"1339-1345","publicationTitle":"ACS Macro Letters","DOI":"10.1021/acsmacrolett.1c00521","issue":"11","journalAbbreviation":"ACS Macro Lett.","creators":[{"firstName":"Akash","lastName":"Arora","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tzyy-Shyang","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nathan J.","lastName":"Rebello","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sarah H.

Quantitative prediction of polymer solubility space for an arbitrary polymer–solvent pair and across a large composition range is challenging. Qualitative agreement is provided by many current theoretical models, but only a portion of the phase space is quantitatively predicted. Here, we utilize a curated database for binary polymer solutions comprised of 21 linear polymers, 61 solvents, and 97 unique polymer–solvent combinations (6524 cloud point temperatures) to construct phase diagrams from machine learning predictions. A generalizable feature vector is developed that includes component descriptors concatenated with state variables and an experimental data descriptor (phase direction). The impact of several types of descriptors (Morgan fingerprints, molecular descriptors, and Hansen solubility parameters) to encode polymer–solvent interactions is assessed. Hansen solubility parameters are also introduced as a means to understand the general breadth of the linear polymer–solvent space as well as the density and distribution of curated data. Two common regression algorithms (XGBoost and neural networks) establish the generality of the descriptors; provide a root mean squared error (RMSE) within 3 °C for predicted cloud points in the test set; and offer excellent agreement with upper and lower critical solubility curves, isopleths, and closed-loop phase behavior by a single model. The ability to extrapolate to polymers that are very dissimilar from the curated data is poor, but with as little as 20 cloud points or a single phase boundary, RMSE error of predictions are within 5 °C. This implies that the current model captures aspects of the underlying physics and can readily exploit correlations to reduce required data for additional polymer–solvent pairs. Finally, the model and data are accessible via the Polymer Property Predictor and Database (3PDb).","date":"2022-04-12","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00245","accessDate":"2024-03-20T21:46:28Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"55","pages":"2691-2702","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00245","issue":"7","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Jeffrey G.","lastName":"Ethier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rohan K.","lastName":"Casukhela","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joshua J.","lastName":"Latimer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew D.","lastName":"Jacobsen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Rasin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maneesh K.","lastName":"Gupta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luke A.","lastName":"Baldwin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard A.","lastName":"Vaia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/UBD7IQQE"]},"dateAdded":"2022-06-29T15:27:33Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T21:49:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/SVQNMVEA","itemID":6034,"attachments":[{"key":"RH92NMNA","version":7072,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ethier_et_al-2022-predicting_phase_behavior_of_linear_polymers_in_solution_using_machine_learning.pdf","parentItem":"SVQNMVEA","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/ethier_et_al-2022-predicting_phase_behavior_of_linear_polymers_in_solution_using_machine_learning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T21:46:36Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:09:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/RH92NMNA","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/ethier_et_al-2022-predicting_phase_behavior_of_linear_polymers_in_solution_using_machine_learning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6041/ethier_et_al-2022-predicting_phase_behavior_of_linear_polymers_in_solution_using_machine_learning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084351,"version":0},"$loki":1835},{"itemID":6036,"item":{"key":"K6327G86","version":9177,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Theory of Microphase Separation in Concentrated Solutions of Sequence-Specific Charged Heteropolymers","abstractNote":"We present a general theory of the phase behavior of concentrated multicomponent solutions of charged flexible heteropolymers with specific chemical sequences. Using a field theoretic formalism, we have accounted for sequence specificity, electrostatic and van der Waals interactions among all constituent species, and topological correlations among all heteropolymer chains in the system. Our general expression for the Helmholtz free energy of the system is in terms of density profiles of the various components and is an explicit function of the sequence specificity of the heteropolymers, polymer concentration, salt concentration, chemical mismatch among the various monomers and solvent, and temperature. We illustrate our general theory in the context of the self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins by considering solutions of sequence-specific charged-neutral heteropolymers. For the heteropolymers under consideration, the system exhibits microphase separation. The boundaries of order–disorder transition and the relative stabilities of the canonical microphase-separated morphologies (lamellar, cylindrical, and spherical) are presented in the weak segregation limit as functions of sequence, polymer concentration, chemical mismatch parameters, and salt concentration. Unique mapping between heteropolymer sequence and morphology diagram is presented.

An analytical approach consistently describing both weak and strong correlations is proposed, which is based on the improvement of the random phase approximation (RPA) by taking into account (i) discreteness of charges in polymer chains and (ii) a finite number of wave modes of the charge density fluctuations. These modifications are an essential element of the particle-to-field transformation. For strong Coulomb interactions, the generalized RPA reproduces the free energy of the strongly correlated Wigner liquid of disjointed charges. The developed theory is applied to describe coil-to-globule transitions in single-chain polyampholytes as a function of the monomer sequence.

We explore the consequences of the temperature dependence of the solvent dielectric constant (ε) and the solvent–polymer interaction parameter (χ) on the complex coacervates’ phase behavior. The results show that the temperature dependence of the solvent dielectric constant and solvent–polymer interaction parameter can result in a complex phase behavior involving two disjoint unstable regions on the temperature (T)–polyelectrolyte concentration (ϕp) plane. Comparison of phase diagrams constructed for different possible temperature dependencies of ε and χ shows that the experimentally observed LCST behavior is obtained only if the solvent dielectric constant decreases and the solvent–polymer interaction parameter increases with increasing temperature. Preferential partitioning of salt into the polyelectrolyte poor phase is predicted for all possible combinations of temperature dependencies of χ and ε considered in this work.","date":"2019-09-24","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b01201","accessDate":"2024-03-21T15:24:17Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"52","pages":"6998-7004","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.macromol.9b01201","issue":"18","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Sabin","lastName":"Adhikari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vivek M.","lastName":"Prabhu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Murugappan","lastName":"Muthukumar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T15:24:17Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T15:24:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/3DR59HF6","itemID":6168,"attachments":[{"key":"E7ZJF94U","version":7060,"itemType":"attachment","title":"adhikari_prabhu_muthukumar-2019-lower_critical_solution_temperature_behavior_in_polyelectrolyte_complex.pdf","parentItem":"3DR59HF6","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/adhikari_prabhu_muthukumar-2019-lower_critical_solution_temperature_behavior_in_polyelectrolyte_complex.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T15:24:22Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/E7ZJF94U","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/adhikari_prabhu_muthukumar-2019-lower_critical_solution_temperature_behavior_in_polyelectrolyte_complex.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6170/adhikari_prabhu_muthukumar-2019-lower_critical_solution_temperature_behavior_in_polyelectrolyte_complex.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084354,"version":0},"$loki":1839},{"itemID":6180,"item":{"key":"J8YHIRWQ","version":10190,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Deep learning model for predicting phase diagrams of block copolymers","abstractNote":"Block copolymers show various microphase-separated structures depending on their chain architecture and the interaction parameters between the different chemical structures of monomeric unit χ. Self-consistent field theory is a powerful tool to predict such phase-separated structures, and phase diagrams of block copolymers have been reported using self-consistent field theory. However, obtaining stable morphology of each polymer structure and the χ parameter requires intensive computational study. We applied deep learning to predict phase diagrams from metastable structures obtained by crude, cost-effective self-consistent field calculation. We used a 3D convolutional neural network for classification of the metastable structures, and a limited number of sets of block copolymer structures and χ parameters with stable phase labels were used for training. After the model was trained using the training set, it successfully assigned the metastable structures of a wide variety of diblock and triblock copolymers to the correct stable phases.

Accounting for electrostatic and excluded volume interactions based on the protein sequence, our Langevin dynamics simulations reveal that α-synuclein molecules assemble into aggregates and percolated structures with a spontaneous selection of a dominant structure characteristic of microphase separation. This microphase assembly is mainly driven by electrostatic interactions between the residues in N-terminal and C-terminal of the protein molecules, and presence of salt loosens the compactness of the microstructures. We have quantified the features of the spontaneously formed microstructures using interchain radial distribution functions, and experimentally measurable inter-residue contact maps and static structure factors. Our results are in contrast to the commonly hypothesized mechanism of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) for the formation of droplets in solutions of intrinsically disordered proteins, opening a new paradigm to understand the birth and structure of membraneless organelles.

Several areas of fundamental development and novel applications of charge complexation for interfacial study and examples from membraneless organelles and biomolecular condensates are described.","date":"2021-06-01","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359029421000066","accessDate":"2024-03-21T16:23:33Z","volume":"53","pages":"101422","publicationTitle":"Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.cocis.2021.101422","journalAbbreviation":"Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science","ISSN":"1359-0294","creators":[{"firstName":"Vivek M.","lastName":"Prabhu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Biomolecular condensates","type":1},{"tag":"Colloidal probe AFM","type":1},{"tag":"Critical salt concentration","type":1},{"tag":"Critical temperature","type":1},{"tag":"Deformed droplet retraction","type":1},{"tag":"Interfacial tension","type":1},{"tag":"Phase separation","type":1},{"tag":"Polyelectrolyte","type":1},{"tag":"Surface forces apparatus","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/K44T4M2R"]},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:23:33Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T21:34:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/5R9YJBET","itemID":6536,"attachments":[{"key":"Z59UMLTG","version":7145,"itemType":"attachment","title":"prabhu-2021-interfacial_tension_in_polyelectrolyte_systems_exhibiting_associative.pdf","parentItem":"5R9YJBET","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science/prabhu-2021-interfacial_tension_in_polyelectrolyte_systems_exhibiting_associative.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T18:12:11Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/Z59UMLTG","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science/prabhu-2021-interfacial_tension_in_polyelectrolyte_systems_exhibiting_associative.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6756/prabhu-2021-interfacial_tension_in_polyelectrolyte_systems_exhibiting_associative.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084357,"version":0},"$loki":1844},{"itemID":6538,"item":{"key":"5CTHBJGI","version":10946,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Thermodynamic Characterization of Polypeptide Complex Coacervation","abstractNote":"The interactions between a series of oppositely charged polypeptide pairs are probed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in combination with turbidity measurements and optical microscopy. Polypeptide complex coacervation is described as a sequence of two distinct binding steps using an empirical extension of a simple ITC binding model. The first step consists of the formation of soluble complexes from oppositely charged polypeptides (ion pairing), which in turn aggregate into insoluble interpolymer complexes in the second step (complex coacervation). Polypeptides have identical backbones and differ only in their charged side groups, making them attractive model systems for this work. The poly(l-ornithine hydrobromide) (PO)/poly(l-glutamic acid sodium salt) (PGlu) system is used to examine the effects of parameters such as the salt concentration, pH, temperature, degree of polymerization, and total polymer concentration on the thermodynamic characteristics of complexation. Complex coacervation in all probed systems is found to be endothermic, essentially an entropy-driven processes. Increasing the screening effect of the salt on the polyelectrolyte charges diminishes their propensity to interact, leading to a decrease in the observed energy change and coacervate quantity. The pH plays an important role in complex formation through its effect on the degree of ionization of the functional groups. Plotting the change in enthalpy with temperature allows the calculation of the heat capacity change (ΔCp) for the PO/PGlu interactions. Finally, ITC revealed that complex coacervation is promoted when higher total polymer concentrations or polypeptide chain lengths are used.","date":"2012-11-13","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/la302729r","accessDate":"2024-03-21T16:23:38Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"28","pages":"15947-15957","publicationTitle":"Langmuir","DOI":"10.1021/la302729r","issue":"45","journalAbbreviation":"Langmuir","ISSN":"0743-7463","creators":[{"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Priftis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Laugel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tirrell","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/7VECNIJ3"]},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:23:38Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T21:35:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/5CTHBJGI","itemID":6538,"attachments":[{"key":"HPPN56PM","version":7146,"itemType":"attachment","title":"priftis_laugel_tirrell-2012-thermodynamic_characterization_of_polypeptide_complex_coacervation.pdf","parentItem":"5CTHBJGI","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Langmuir/priftis_laugel_tirrell-2012-thermodynamic_characterization_of_polypeptide_complex_coacervation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T16:23:44Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/HPPN56PM","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Langmuir/priftis_laugel_tirrell-2012-thermodynamic_characterization_of_polypeptide_complex_coacervation.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6545/priftis_laugel_tirrell-2012-thermodynamic_characterization_of_polypeptide_complex_coacervation.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084357,"version":0},"$loki":1845},{"itemID":6573,"item":{"key":"6Q5A6E34","version":10880,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Complex coacervation in sulfated polyvinyl alcohol- aminoacetalyzed polyvinyl alcohol system","abstractNote":"The complex coacervation, defined as a liquid-liquid phase separation in the system of polycation-polyanionsolvent with or without added microsalt, was investigated with polyelectrolytes prepared from polyvinyl alcohol by partial esterification.

Most IDPs are polyampholytes, with sequences that include both positively and negatively charged residues. Accordingly, we focus here on the sequence–ensemble relationships of polyampholytic IDPs. The fraction of charged residues discriminates between weak and strong polyampholytes. Using atomistic simulations, we show that weak polyampholytes form globules, whereas the conformational preferences of strong polyampholytes are determined by a combination of fraction of charged residues values and the linear sequence distributions of oppositely charged residues. We quantify the latter using a patterning parameter κ that lies between zero and one. The value of κ is low for well-mixed sequences, and in these sequences, intrachain electrostatic repulsions and attractions are counterbalanced, leading to the unmasking of preferences for conformations that resemble either self-avoiding random walks or generic Flory random coils. Segregation of oppositely charged residues within linear sequences leads to high κ-values and preferences for hairpin-like conformations caused by long-range electrostatic attractions induced by conformational fluctuations. We propose a scaling theory to explain the sequence-encoded conformational properties of strong polyampholytes. We show that naturally occurring strong polyampholytes have low κ-values, and this feature implies a selection for random coil ensembles. The design of sequences with different κ-values demonstrably alters the conformational preferences of polyampholytic IDPs, and this ability could become a useful tool for enabling direct inquiries into connections between sequence–ensemble relationships and functions of IDPs.","date":"2013-08-13","libraryCatalog":"pnas.org (Atypon)","url":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1304749110","accessDate":"2024-03-21T21:07:30Z","extra":"Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"110","pages":"13392-13397","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1304749110","issue":"33","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","creators":[{"firstName":"Rahul K.","lastName":"Das","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rohit V.","lastName":"Pappu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","UF75T3ZQ","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/U3CD8RIR"]},"dateAdded":"2023-03-22T17:35:12Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:30:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/KFRD8K2L","itemID":6911,"attachments":[{"key":"7AKQ8UYY","version":7270,"itemType":"attachment","title":"das_pappu-2013-conformations_of_intrinsically_disordered_proteins_are_influenced_by_linear.pdf","parentItem":"KFRD8K2L","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/PNAS/das_pappu-2013-conformations_of_intrinsically_disordered_proteins_are_influenced_by_linear.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T21:38:29Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:09:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/7AKQ8UYY","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/PNAS/das_pappu-2013-conformations_of_intrinsically_disordered_proteins_are_influenced_by_linear.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7051/das_pappu-2013-conformations_of_intrinsically_disordered_proteins_are_influenced_by_linear.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084360,"version":0},"$loki":1848},{"itemID":6939,"item":{"key":"G3G569GE","version":10993,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Interfacial Tension of Polyelectrolyte Complex Coacervate Phases","abstractNote":"We consider polyelectrolyte solutions which, under suitable conditions, phase separate into a liquid-like coacervate phase and a coexisting supernatant phase that exhibit an extremely low interfacial tension. Such interfacial tension provides the basis for most coacervate-based applications, but little is known about it, including its dependence on molecular weight, charge density, and salt concentration. By combining a Debye–Hückel treatment for electrostatic interactions with the Cahn–Hilliard theory, we derive explicit expressions for this interfacial tension. In the absence of added salts, we find that the interfacial tension scales as N–3/2(η/ηc–1)3/2 near the critical point of the demixing transition, and that it scales as η1/2 far away from it, where N is the chain length and η measures the electrostatic interaction strength as a function of temperature, dielectric constant, and charge density of the polyelectrolytes. For the case with added salts, we find that the interfacial tension scales with the salt concentration ψ as N–1/4(1−ψ/ψc)3/2 near the critical salt concentration ψc. Our predictions are shown to be in quantitative agreement with experiments and provide a means to design new materials based on polyelectrolyte complexation.","date":"2014-06-17","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/mz500190w","accessDate":"2024-03-21T21:14:54Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"3","pages":"565-568","publicationTitle":"ACS Macro Letters","DOI":"10.1021/mz500190w","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"ACS Macro Lett.","creators":[{"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Qin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Priftis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Farina","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sarah L.","lastName":"Perry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lorraine","lastName":"Leon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Whitmer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kyle","lastName":"Hoffmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tirrell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Juan J.","lastName":"de Pablo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T21:14:55Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T21:14:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/G3G569GE","itemID":6939,"attachments":[{"key":"N95QDIPJ","version":7148,"itemType":"attachment","title":"qin_et_al-2014-interfacial_tension_of_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervate_phases.pdf","parentItem":"G3G569GE","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/ACS Macro Lett./qin_et_al-2014-interfacial_tension_of_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervate_phases.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T21:37:53Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/N95QDIPJ","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/ACS Macro Lett./qin_et_al-2014-interfacial_tension_of_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervate_phases.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7034/qin_et_al-2014-interfacial_tension_of_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervate_phases.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084360,"version":0},"$loki":1849},{"itemID":6943,"item":{"key":"3XM2W5QZ","version":10966,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Driving Force for the Complexation of Charged Polypeptides","abstractNote":"The phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in solution is of current interest. In this work, we study the driving force for polyelectrolyte complexation using molecular dynamics simulations. We calculate the potential of mean force between poly(lysine) and poly(glutamate) oligomers using three different force fields, an atomistic force field and two coarse-grained force fields. There is qualitative agreement between all force fields, i.e., the sign and magnitude of the free energy and the nature of the driving force are similar, which suggests that the molecular nature of water does not play a significant role. For fully charged peptides, we find that the driving force for association is entropic in all cases when small ions either neutralize the poly ions, or are in excess. The removal of all counterions switches the driving force, making complexation energetic. This suggests that the entropy of complexation is dominated by the counterions. When only 6 residues of a 11-mer are charged, however, the driving force is energetic in the abscence of excess salt. The simulations shed insight into the mechanism of complex coacervation and the importance of realistic models for the polyions.","date":"2020-02-20","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b09553","accessDate":"2024-03-21T21:15:06Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"124","pages":"1285-1292","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry B","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b09553","issue":"7","journalAbbreviation":"J.

Both of these find use in many applications, including drug delivery, gene therapy, layer-by-layer films, and fabrication of ion filtration membranes. The mechanism of polyelectrolyte complexation is, however, still not completely understood, though experimental investigations suggest that entropy gain due to release of counterions is the key driving force for strong polyelectrolyte complexation. Here we perform a comprehensive thermodynamic investigation through coarse-grained molecular simulations permitting us to calculate the free energy of complex formation. Importantly, our expanded-ensemble methods permit the explicit separation of energetic and entropic contributions to the free energy. Our investigations indicate that entropic contributions indeed dominate the free energy of complex formation for strong polyelectrolytes, but are less important than energetic contributions when weak electrostatic coupling or weak polyelectrolytes are present. Our results provide a new view of the free energy of polyelectrolyte complex formation driven by polymer association, which should also arise in systems with large charge spacings or bulky counterions, both of which act to weaken ion–polymer binding.","date":"2018-11-14","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b08649","accessDate":"2024-03-21T21:15:10Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"140","pages":"15319-15328","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","DOI":"10.1021/jacs.8b08649","issue":"45","journalAbbreviation":"J.

This attraction is broken down into an entropic component, due to loss of counterions, and an enthalpic component, stemming from Coulombic attraction between opposite charges. While the balance between entropic and enthalpic contributions shifts according to the conditions, the presence of exotherms or endotherms on mixing, though small, are viewed as signatures of Coulombic interactions which support theories of polyelectrolyte association rooted in continuum electrostatics. Here, a head-to-head comparison is made between mechanisms based on electrostatics and those based on specific ion pairing, or ion exchange. Using a Hofmeister series of counterions for a common polycation, poly(diallyldimethylammonium), enthalpy changes on association with poly(styrenesulfonate) are shown to derive from changes in water perturbation, revealed by Raman scattering studies of water O–H vibrations. The free energy for complexation is almost completely entropic over all salt concentrations.","date":"2016-01-27","shortTitle":"Driving Forces for Oppositely Charged Polyion Association in Aqueous Solutions","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5b11878","accessDate":"2024-03-21T21:15:20Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"138","pages":"980-990","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","DOI":"10.1021/jacs.5b11878","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"J.

Three different techniques (turbidity, isothermal titration microcalorimetry-ITC and rheology) were used in a comprehensive study of coacervation. Sample turbidity was used to show how various parameters (salt, stoichiometry, pH, temperature) affect complex coacervation. Complex coacervation decreases with increase in salt and coacervate formation is maximum when a 31:69mol% acid:base ratio is used. Rare in literature phase diagrams revealed that coacervates are formed over a wide range of acid:base ratios (15–88mol% NH3+ groups), significantly broader compared to other systems. ITC was used for the thermodynamic characterization of the complexation between the polyelectrolytes, and showed that complex coacervation is entropy-driven (from the release of counter-ions) and enthalpically unfavored process. Composition and viscoelastic properties of the complex coacervates were examined gravimetrically and through rheology. Coacervate water content depends on the salt concentration and the stoichiometry. Coacervates exhibit a viscoelastic behavior that is dependent on the salt concentration. Master curves that can predict behavior at a wide range of time scales, not accessible by conventional rheological measurements, were created.","date":"2013-05-15","shortTitle":"Complex coacervation of poly(ethylene-imine)/polypeptide aqueous solutions","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979713000957","accessDate":"2024-03-21T21:15:23Z","volume":"398","pages":"39-50","publicationTitle":"Journal of Colloid and Interface Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcis.2013.01.055","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Colloid and Interface Science","ISSN":"0021-9797","creators":[{"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Priftis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katie","lastName":"Megley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Laugel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tirrell","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Complex coacervation","type":1},{"tag":"Isothermal titration microcalorimetry","type":1},{"tag":"Polypeptides","type":1},{"tag":"Rheology","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T21:15:23Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T21:15:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/IA7JZCRZ","itemID":6951,"attachments":[{"key":"JXWI8GTZ","version":7146,"itemType":"attachment","title":"priftis_et_al-2013-complex_coacervation_of_poly(ethylene-imine)-polypeptide_aqueous_solutions.pdf","parentItem":"IA7JZCRZ","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Journal of Colloid and Interface Science/priftis_et_al-2013-complex_coacervation_of_poly(ethylene-imine)-polypeptide_aqueous_solutions.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

This breadth is accompanied by an assortment of contexts and models in which polyelectrolytes are seen as (a) protein cognates assisting in complex cellular roles, (b) surrogates for the extracellular matrix, mimicking its hydration, mechanical and sequestering properties, (c) benign hosts that gently entrap, deposit and tether protein substrate specificity, and (d) selective but non-specific agents that modify protein solubility. Unsurprisingly, this literature is somewhat segregated by objectives and paradigms. We hope this review, which emphasizes publications over the last 8 years, represents and also counterbalances that divergence. An ongoing theme is the role of electrostatics, and we show how this leads to the variety of physical forms taken by protein–polyelectrolyte complexes. We present approaches towards analysis and characterization, motivated by the goal of structure–property elucidation. Such understanding should guide in applications, our third topic. We present recent developments in modeling and simulations of protein–polyelectrolyte systems. We close with a prospective on future developments in this field.","date":"2013-02-06","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"pubs.rsc.org","url":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/sm/c2sm27002a","accessDate":"2024-03-21T21:28:30Z","extra":"Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry","volume":"9","pages":"2553-2583","publicationTitle":"Soft Matter","DOI":"10.1039/C2SM27002A","issue":"9","journalAbbreviation":"Soft Matter","ISSN":"1744-6848","creators":[{"firstName":"A.

complexes","abstractNote":"The field of polyelectrolye–protein complexes is now benefiting from the convergence of three themes whose disciplinary distinctions formerly produced fragmentation. Theory and simulations, previously restricted to isotropic models of colloids and polyelectrolytes, are now taking into account the heterogeneity of charges in both macroions and providing far more realistic depictions of proteins. Applications of protein–polyelectrolyte systems have been strongly influenced by the opportunities presented by multilayer assembly, and the dichotomy between semi-synthetic systems and the protein–biopolyelectrolyte cognate pairs of biochemical interest has been giving way to less parochial recognition of universal effects. The junction of these disciplines, along with the development of many new methods of investigation, form the subject of this review focused on recent developments and their foundations.","date":"2005-08-01","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359029405000300","accessDate":"2024-03-21T21:30:02Z","volume":"10","pages":"52-78","publicationTitle":"Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.cocis.2005.05.007","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science","ISSN":"1359-0294","creators":[{"firstName":"C.

However, there are many known methodological pitfalls, including data leakage, in ML-based science. We systematically investigate reproducibility issues in ML-based science. Through a survey of literature in ﬁelds that have adopted ML methods, we ﬁnd 17 ﬁelds where leakage has been found, collectively affecting 294 papers and, in some cases, leading to wildly overoptimistic conclusions. Based on our survey, we introduce a detailed taxonomy of eight types of leakage, ranging from textbook errors to open research problems. We propose that researchers test for each type of leakage by ﬁlling out model info sheets, which we introduce. Finally, we conduct a reproducibility study of civil war prediction, where complex ML models are believed to vastly outperform traditional statistical models such as logistic regression (LR). When the errors are corrected, complex ML models do not perform substantively better than decades-old LR models.","date":"09/2023","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2666389923001599","accessDate":"2024-03-21T21:34:43Z","volume":"4","pages":"100804","publicationTitle":"Patterns","DOI":"10.1016/j.patter.2023.100804","issue":"9","journalAbbreviation":"Patterns","ISSN":"26663899","creators":[{"firstName":"Sayash","lastName":"Kapoor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Narayanan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T21:34:43Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T21:34:43Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/KZW8WCV5","itemID":7011,"attachments":[{"key":"3CTENMM2","version":7089,"itemType":"attachment","title":"kapoor_narayanan-2023-leakage_and_the_reproducibility_crisis_in_machine-learning-based_science.pdf","parentItem":"KZW8WCV5","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Patterns/kapoor_narayanan-2023-leakage_and_the_reproducibility_crisis_in_machine-learning-based_science.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Individual polyelectrolyte yields were deduced from thermogravimetric analysis and chitosan quantification via enzymatic hydrolysis/HPLC-ELSD. The polyelectrolyte mass ratio in the complex coacervate is found to remain approximately constant irrespective of the pH, despite the latter’s effect on the polyelectrolyte charge ratio. Two regimes are identified, including either chitosan charges in excess (at pH < 6.0) or gum arabic charges in excess (at pH > 6.0). The amount of extrinsic charge compensation in the complex coacervates is discussed in detail. We show for the first time that the doping level, a quantity traditionally used to describe salt-induced changes of the charge compensation in polyelectrolyte complexes, is also suitable for the description of pH-induced extrinsic charge compensation in such systems.","date":"2023-03-13","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.2c01255","accessDate":"2024-03-22T16:33:21Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"24","pages":"1194-1208","publicationTitle":"Biomacromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.biomac.2c01255","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Biomacromolecules","ISSN":"1525-7797","creators":[{"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Schröder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Cord-Landwehr","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Monika","lastName":"Schönhoff","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cornelia","lastName":"Cramer","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-22T16:33:21Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T16:33:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/BJD8UKWZ","itemID":7115,"attachments":[{"key":"CMT6NI26","version":7531,"itemType":"attachment","title":"schröder_et_al-2023-composition_and_charge_compensation_in_chitosan-gum_arabic_complex_coacervates.pdf","parentItem":"BJD8UKWZ","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Biomacromolecules/schröder_et_al-2023-composition_and_charge_compensation_in_chitosan-gum_arabic_complex_coacervates.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-22T16:33:23Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T16:33:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/CMT6NI26","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Biomacromolecules/schröder_et_al-2023-composition_and_charge_compensation_in_chitosan-gum_arabic_complex_coacervates.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7117/schröder_et_al-2023-composition_and_charge_compensation_in_chitosan-gum_arabic_complex_coacervates.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084365,"version":0},"$loki":1857},{"itemID":7121,"item":{"key":"NAE2PZ9M","version":10533,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Influence of Charge Block Length on Conformation and Solution Behavior of Polyampholytes","abstractNote":"We investigate the effect of charge block length on polyampholyte chain conformation and phase behavior using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and implicit-solvent molecular simulations. To this end, we use solid phase peptide synthesis to precision-tailor a series of polyampholytes consisting of l-glutamic acid (E) and l-lysine (K) monomers arranged in alternating blocks from 2 to 16 monomers. We observe that the polyampholytes tend to phase separate as block size increases. With addition of NaCl, phase separated polyampholytes exhibit a salting-in effect dependent on charge block length. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that are disrupted upon the addition of NaCl, implicating both electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding in the phase behavior. SAXS spectra at no-added salt conditions show minimal dependence of charge block length on the radius of gyration (Rg) for soluble polyampholytes, but local chain stiffening is found to be dependent on charge block length. With increasing NaCl, consistent with electrostatic screening, all polyampholytes expand and behave as neutral or swollen chains in good solvent conditions. Molecular simulations are qualitatively consistent with experiments. Implications for understanding intracellular condensates and material design are noted.","date":"2023-02-21","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmacrolett.2c00665","accessDate":"2024-03-22T16:33:29Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"12","pages":"195-200","publicationTitle":"ACS Macro Letters","DOI":"10.1021/acsmacrolett.2c00665","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"ACS Macro Lett.","creators":[{"firstName":"Winnie H.","lastName":"Shi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rohan S.","lastName":"Adhikari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dilipkumar N.","lastName":"Asthagiri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amanda B.","lastName":"Marciel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-22T16:33:29Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T16:33:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/NAE2PZ9M","itemID":7121,"attachments":[{"key":"9LSDAFK7","version":7537,"itemType":"attachment","title":"shi_et_al-2023-influence_of_charge_block_length_on_conformation_and_solution_behavior_of.pdf","parentItem":"NAE2PZ9M","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/ACS Macro Lett./shi_et_al-2023-influence_of_charge_block_length_on_conformation_and_solution_behavior_of.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-22T16:33:32Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T16:33:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/9LSDAFK7","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/ACS Macro Lett./shi_et_al-2023-influence_of_charge_block_length_on_conformation_and_solution_behavior_of.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7123/shi_et_al-2023-influence_of_charge_block_length_on_conformation_and_solution_behavior_of.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084365,"version":0},"$loki":1858},{"itemID":7288,"item":{"key":"284HM2P2","version":10533,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Sequence Effects on Block Copolymer Self-Assembly through Tuning Chain Conformation and Segregation Strength Utilizing Sequence-Defined Polypeptoids","abstractNote":"Polymers with sequence control offer the possibility of tuning segregation strength with comonomer sequence instead of chemical identity. Here, we have synthesized polystyrene-b-polypeptoid diblock copolymers that differ only in the sequence of comonomers in the polypeptoid block, where nonpolar phenyl side chains are incorporated to tune compatibility with polystyrene. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we see that these materials readily self-assemble into lamellae, with domain spacings and order–disorder transition temperatures varying with sequence, despite identical composition. The ordered state is likely governed by chain conformational effects that localize compatibilizing comonomers at the block–block interface. These altered chain conformations are supported by simulations with self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and lead to the observed changes in domain spacing. However, the trends seen in the order–disorder transition are not captured by SCFT simulations or effective χ parameters, measured in the disordered phase by approximating the copolypeptoid as a uniform block. The disagreement between measured thermodynamic properties and coarse-grained approaches like SCFT and effective χ points to the importance of molecular-scale effects in sequence-defined materials. Additionally, a reversal in relative disordering temperatures between forward and inverse taper sequences is observed compared to previous studies, likely due to a combination of sequence definition at the monomer length scale and the use of a “styrene-like” compatibilizing side chain rather than a true polystyrene repeat unit. These results demonstrate that comonomer sequence tunes chain conformation and segregation strength, suggesting that sequence design could be used to target desired properties and morphologies in block copolymer materials while retaining important chemical functionalities.","date":"2019-02-12","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b02298","accessDate":"2024-04-10T21:25:52Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"52","pages":"1277-1286","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.macromol.8b02298","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Anastasia L.","lastName":"Patterson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Scott P.

Similar to small organic molecules, a large chemical space of such materials is hypothetically accessible. Computational property prediction and virtual screening can accelerate polymer design by prioritizing candidates expected to have favorable properties. However, in contrast to organic molecules, polymers are often not well-defined single structures but an ensemble of similar molecules, which poses unique challenges to traditional chemical representations and machine learning approaches. Here, we introduce a graph representation of molecular ensembles and an associated graph neural network architecture that is tailored to polymer property prediction. We demonstrate that this approach captures critical features of polymeric materials, like chain architecture, monomer stoichiometry, and degree of polymerization, and achieves superior accuracy to off-the-shelf cheminformatics methodologies. While doing so, we built a dataset of simulated electron affinity and ionization potential values for >40k polymers with varying monomer composition, stoichiometry, and chain architecture, which may be used in the development of other tailored machine learning approaches. The dataset and machine learning models presented in this work pave the path toward new classes of algorithms for polymer informatics and, more broadly, introduce a framework for the modeling of molecular ensembles.","date":"2022-09-14","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"pubs.rsc.org","url":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/sc/d2sc02839e","accessDate":"2024-06-17T23:04:17Z","extra":"Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry\nCitation Key: aldeghiGraphRepresentationMolecular2022","volume":"13","pages":"10486-10498","publicationTitle":"Chemical Science","DOI":"10.1039/D2SC02839E","issue":"35","journalAbbreviation":"Chem.

We contribute extensive benchmarks of standard and novel deep learning methods as well as tree-based models such as XGBoost and Random Forests, across a large number of datasets and hyperparam-eter combinations. We define a standard set of 45 datasets from varied domains with clear characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking methodology accounting for both fitting models and finding good hyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (∼10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and neural networks. This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers aiming to build tabular-specific neural network: <b>1</b>. be robust to uninformative features, <b>2</b>. preserve the orientation of the data, and <b>3</b>. be able to easily learn irregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we contribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20 000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner.","date":"2022","libraryCatalog":"ACM Digital Library","accessDate":"2024-06-21","ISBN":"978-1-71387-108-8","pages":"507–520","series":"NIPS '22","proceedingsTitle":"36th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems","DOI":"10.5555/3600270.3600307","creators":[{"firstName":"Léo","lastName":"Grinsztajn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Edouard","lastName":"Oyallon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gaël","lastName":"Varoquaux","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-06-21T18:08:36Z","dateModified":"2024-06-24T14:58:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/X8QBP7E9","itemID":7736,"attachments":[{"key":"J9B33PEL","version":9813,"itemType":"attachment","title":"grinsztajn_oyallon_varoquaux-2024-why_do_tree-based_models_still_outperform_deep_learning_on_typical_tabular_data.pdf","parentItem":"X8QBP7E9","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Conference Paper/Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems/grinsztajn_oyallon_varoquaux-2024-why_do_tree-based_models_still_outperform_deep_learning_on_typical_tabular_data.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Self-Assemblies of Sequence-Defined Ionic Peptoid Block Copolymers","abstractNote":"A series of amphiphilic ionic peptoid block copolymers where the total number (1 or 3) and position of ionic monomers along the polymer chain are precisely controlled have been synthesized by the submonomer method. Upon dissolution in water at pH = 9, the amphiphilic peptoids self-assemble into small spherical micelles having hydrodynamic radius in ∼5–10 nm range and critical micellar concentration (CMC) in the 0.034–0.094 mg/mL range. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) analysis of the micellar solutions revealed unprecedented dependence of the micellar structure on the number and position of ionic monomers along the chain. It was found that the micellar aggregation number (Nagg) and the micellar radius (Rm) both increase as the ionic monomer is positioned progressively away from the junction of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments along the polymer chain. By defining an ionic monomer position number (n) as the number of monomers between the junction and the ionic monomer, Nagg exhibited a power law dependence on n with an exponent of ∼1/3 and ∼3/10 for the respective singly and triply charged series. By contrast, Rm exhibited a weaker dependence on the ionic monomer position by a power law relationship with an exponent of ∼1/10 and ∼1/20 for the respective singly and triply charged series. Furthermore, Rm was found to scale with Nagg in a power-law relationship with an exponent of 0.32 for the singly charged series, consistent with a weakly charged ionic star-like polymer model in the unscreened regime. This study demonstrated a unique method to precisely tailor the structure of small spherical micelles based on ionic block copolymers by controlling the sequence and position of the ionic monomer.","date":"2018-03-21","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b00461","accessDate":"2024-07-11T22:32:15Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society\nCitation Key: sternhagenSolutionSelfAssembliesSequenceDefined2018","volume":"140","pages":"4100-4109","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","DOI":"10.1021/jacs.8b00461","issue":"11","journalAbbreviation":"J.

Polysaccharide chain length affects immunomodulation, but its impact on bacterial physiology and antibiotic susceptibility was unclear. We probed the consequences of truncating the mycobacterial galactan, an essential linear polysaccharide of about 30 residues. Galactan covalently bridges cell envelope layers, with the outermost cell wall linkage point occurring at residue 12. Reducing galactan chain length by approximately half compromises fitness, alters cell morphology, and increases the potency of hydrophobic antibiotics. Systematic variation of the galactan chain length revealed that it determines periplasm size. Thus, glycan chain length can directly affect cellular physiology and antibiotic activity, and mycobacterial glycans, not proteins, regulate periplasm size.","date":"2020-09-16","libraryCatalog":"science.org (Atypon)","url":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba4015","accessDate":"2024-07-12T14:59:01Z","extra":"Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","volume":"6","pages":"eaba4015","publicationTitle":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.aba4015","issue":"38","creators":[{"firstName":"Alexander M.","lastName":"Justen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Heather L.","lastName":"Hodges","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lili M.","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patric W.","lastName":"Sadecki","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Porfirio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eveline","lastName":"Ultee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Black","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Grace S.","lastName":"Chung","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ariane","lastName":"Briegel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Parastoo","lastName":"Azadi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura L.","lastName":"Kiessling","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-12T14:59:01Z","dateModified":"2024-07-12T14:59:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/QF95V3ND","itemID":7833,"attachments":[{"key":"GIYZMJZ6","version":10416,"itemType":"attachment","title":"justen_et_al-2020-polysaccharide_length_affects_mycobacterial_cell_shape_and_antibiotic.pdf","parentItem":"QF95V3ND","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Science Advances/justen_et_al-2020-polysaccharide_length_affects_mycobacterial_cell_shape_and_antibiotic.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-12T14:59:05Z","dateModified":"2024-07-12T14:59:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/GIYZMJZ6","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Science Advances/justen_et_al-2020-polysaccharide_length_affects_mycobacterial_cell_shape_and_antibiotic.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7835/justen_et_al-2020-polysaccharide_length_affects_mycobacterial_cell_shape_and_antibiotic.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084381,"version":0},"$loki":1885},{"itemID":7836,"item":{"key":"PNN33Q6T","version":10534,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Systematic Hydrogen-Bond Manipulations To Establish Polysaccharide Structure–Property Correlations","abstractNote":"A dense hydrogen-bond network is responsible for the mechanical and structural properties of polysaccharides. Random derivatization alters the properties of the bulk material by disrupting the hydrogen bonds, but obstructs detailed structure–function correlations. We have prepared well-defined unnatural oligosaccharides including methylated, deoxygenated, deoxyfluorinated, as well as carboxymethylated cellulose and chitin analogues with full control over the degree and pattern of substitution. Molecular dynamics simulations and crystallographic analysis show how distinct hydrogen-bond modifications drastically affect the solubility, aggregation behavior, and crystallinity of carbohydrate materials.

However, information could also be carried by the pattern of acetylation (PA): the sequence of β-1,4-linked glucosamine (deacetylated/D) and N-acetylglucosamine (acetylated/A) units. To address this hypothesis, we prepared partially acetylated chitosan oligosaccharides from a chitosan polymer (DA = 35%, DPw = 905) using recombinant chitosan hydrolases with distinct substrate and cleavage specificities. The mixtures were separated into fractions DP4–DP12, which were tested for elicitor and priming activities in rice cells. We confirmed that both activities were influenced by DP, but also observed apparent DA-dependent priming activity, with the ADDD+DADD fraction proving remarkably effective. We then compared all four monoacetylated tetramers prepared using different chitin deacetylases and observed significant differences in priming activity. This demonstrates for the first time that PA influences the biological activity of chitosans, which can now be recognized as bona fide information-carrying molecules.","date":"2020-01-29","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b11466","accessDate":"2024-07-12T15:00:52Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"142","pages":"1975-1986","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","DOI":"10.1021/jacs.9b11466","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"J.

Fluids are well described by the Navier–Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10× finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.","date":"2021-05-25","libraryCatalog":"pnas.org (Atypon)","url":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2101784118","accessDate":"2024-07-12T20:35:32Z","extra":"Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"118","pages":"e2101784118","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2101784118","issue":"21","creators":[{"firstName":"Dmitrii","lastName":"Kochkov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jamie A.","lastName":"Smith","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ayya","lastName":"Alieva","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael P.","lastName":"Brenner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Hoyer","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-12T20:35:32Z","dateModified":"2024-07-12T20:35:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/ZUAC4QBV","itemID":7847,"attachments":[{"key":"MJQXI2CL","version":10483,"itemType":"attachment","title":"kochkov_et_al-2021-machine_learning–accelerated_computational_fluid_dynamics.pdf","parentItem":"ZUAC4QBV","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences/kochkov_et_al-2021-machine_learning–accelerated_computational_fluid_dynamics.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-12T20:35:44Z","dateModified":"2024-07-12T20:35:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/MJQXI2CL","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences/kochkov_et_al-2021-machine_learning–accelerated_computational_fluid_dynamics.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7849/kochkov_et_al-2021-machine_learning–accelerated_computational_fluid_dynamics.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084383,"version":0},"$loki":1889},{"itemID":7850,"item":{"key":"6YCAXUKX","version":10534,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Dataset of solution-based inorganic materials synthesis procedures extracted from the scientific literature","abstractNote":"The development of a materials synthesis route is usually based on heuristics and experience.

However, this route is impeded by the lack of a large-scale database of synthesis formulations. In this work, we applied advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques to construct a dataset of 35,675 solution-based synthesis procedures extracted from the scientific literature. Each procedure contains essential synthesis information including the precursors and target materials, their quantities, and the synthesis actions and corresponding attributes.

This effectively mitigates ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate information, an issue that previously made the use of large language models (LLMs) in scientific fields challenging. Our approach involves the development of a workflow implementing three different processes for text mining, programmed by ChatGPT itself. All of them enable parsing, searching, filtering, classification, summarization, and data unification with different trade-offs among labor, speed, and accuracy. We deploy this system to extract 26 257 distinct synthesis parameters pertaining to approximately 800 MOFs sourced from peer-reviewed research articles. This process incorporates our ChemPrompt Engineering strategy to instruct ChatGPT in text mining, resulting in impressive precision, recall, and F1 scores of 90–99%. Furthermore, with the data set built by text mining, we constructed a machine-learning model with over 87% accuracy in predicting MOF experimental crystallization outcomes and preliminarily identifying important factors in MOF crystallization. We also developed a reliable data-grounded MOF chatbot to answer questions about chemical reactions and synthesis procedures. Given that the process of using ChatGPT reliably mines and tabulates diverse MOF synthesis information in a unified format while using only narrative language requiring no coding expertise, we anticipate that our ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant will be very useful across various other chemistry subdisciplines.","date":"2023-08-16","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c05819","accessDate":"2024-07-12T21:33:02Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"145","pages":"18048-18062","publicationTitle":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","DOI":"10.1021/jacs.3c05819","issue":"32","journalAbbreviation":"J.

In cases where the library of molecules is exceedingly large, the cost of an exhaustive virtual screen may be prohibitive. Model-guided optimization has been employed to lower these costs through dramatic increases in sample efficiency compared to random selection. However, these techniques introduce new costs to the workflow through the surrogate model training and inference steps. In this study, we propose an extension to the framework of model-guided optimization that mitigates inference costs using a technique we refer to as design space pruning (DSP), which irreversibly removes poor-performing candidates from consideration. We study the application of DSP to a variety of optimization tasks and observe significant reductions in overhead costs while exhibiting similar performance to the baseline optimization. DSP represents an attractive extension of model-guided optimization that can limit overhead costs in optimization settings where these costs are non-negligible relative to objective costs, such as docking.","date":"2022-08-22","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00554","accessDate":"2024-07-12T21:42:22Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society\nCitation Key: graffSelfFocusingVirtualScreening2022","volume":"62","pages":"3854-3862","publicationTitle":"Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00554","issue":"16","journalAbbreviation":"J.

Sets of 36 repeat unit polypeptoids with identical chemical composition, but different sequences of hydrophobic moieties along the oligomer chain (taper, inverse taper, blocky, and evenly distributed), are designed and characterized at air/water interfaces. Polypeptoids are driven to the interfaces by decreasing the solvent quality of the aqueous solution. In situ processing of the adsorbed layers causes a collapse of polypeptoids and the formation of irreversibly adsorbed, solvent-avoiding layers at interfaces. Differences in thermodynamic properties, driven by solubility, between the collapsed structures at interfaces are studied with measurements of interfacial tension. The dilatational modulus of polypeptoid-coated interfaces is used as a proxy to probe the extent of the coil–globule collapse at the interface. The role of hydrophobicity is investigated by comparing four sequences of polypeptoids with an increased size of the hydrophilic side chains. In each set of polypeptoids, the composition of molecules, not the sequence, controls the surface concentration. The molecules are described in terms of the distribution of the hydrophobic monomers on the backbone of the polymer. Inverse taper (IT) and blocky (B) sequences of hydrophobic moieties favor the formation of highly elastic interfaces after processing, while taper (T) and distributed (D) showed lower elasticity after processing, which is achieved by replacing good solvent with poor solvent and then nonsolvent. These structures allow for the study of the impact of the chemical composition and sequence of monomers on the properties of polymer-coated interfaces.","date":"2024-07-12","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c02195","accessDate":"2024-07-13T17:57:02Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","publicationTitle":"Langmuir","DOI":"10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c02195","journalAbbreviation":"Langmuir","ISSN":"0743-7463","creators":[{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Roguski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael L.","lastName":"Davidson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Audra J.","lastName":"DeStefano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rachel A.","lastName":"Segalman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lynn M.","lastName":"Walker","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ","E8YWNDJX"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-13T17:57:02Z","dateModified":"2024-07-13T17:57:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/U9W99T36","itemID":7859,"attachments":[{"key":"KTNDYG3Z","version":10527,"itemType":"attachment","title":"roguski_et_al-2024-polypeptoid_monomer_sequence_and_chemical_composition_as_independent_controls.pdf","parentItem":"U9W99T36","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Langmuir/roguski_et_al-2024-polypeptoid_monomer_sequence_and_chemical_composition_as_independent_controls.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-13T17:57:09Z","dateModified":"2024-07-13T17:57:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/KTNDYG3Z","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Langmuir/roguski_et_al-2024-polypeptoid_monomer_sequence_and_chemical_composition_as_independent_controls.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7861/roguski_et_al-2024-polypeptoid_monomer_sequence_and_chemical_composition_as_independent_controls.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084386,"version":0},"$loki":1893},{"itemID":7872,"item":{"key":"GPNWB6YQ","version":11395,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"How Droplets Can Accelerate Reactions─Coacervate Protocells as Catalytic Microcompartments","abstractNote":"ConspectusCoacervates are droplets formed by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and are often used as model protocells–primitive cell-like compartments that could have aided the emergence of life. Their continued presence as membraneless organelles in modern cells gives further credit to their relevance. The local physicochemical environment inside coacervates is distinctly different from the surrounding dilute solution and offers an interesting microenvironment for prebiotic reactions. Coacervates can selectively take up reactants and enhance their effective concentration, stabilize products, destabilize reactants and lower transition states, and can therefore play a similar role as micellar catalysts in providing rate enhancement and selectivity in reaction outcome. Rate enhancement and selectivity must have been essential for the origins of life by enabling chemical reactions to occur at appreciable rates and overcoming competition from hydrolysis.In this Accounts, we dissect the mechanisms by which coacervate protocells can accelerate reactions and provide selectivity. These mechanisms can similarly be exploited by membraneless organelles to control cellular processes. First, coacervates can affect the local concentration of reactants and accelerate reactions by copartitioning of reactants or exclusion of a product or inhibitor. Second, the local environment inside the coacervate can change the energy landscape for reactions taking place inside the droplets. The coacervate is more apolar than the surrounding solution and often rich in charged moieties, which can affect the stability of reactants, transition states and products. The crowded nature of the droplets can favor complexation of large molecules such as ribozymes. Their locally different proton and water activity can facilitate reactions involving a (de)protonation step, condensation reactions and reactions that are sensitive to hydrolysis. Not only the coacervate core, but also the surface can accelerate reactions and provides an interesting site for chemical reactions with gradients in pH, water activity and charge. The coacervate is often rich in catalytic amino acids and can localize catalysts like divalent metal ions, leading to further rate enhancement inside the droplets. Lastly, these coacervate properties can favor certain reaction pathways, and thereby give selectivity over the reaction outcome.These mechanisms are further illustrated with a case study on ribozyme reactions inside coacervates, for which there is a fine balance between concentration and reactivity that can be tuned by the coacervate composition. Furthermore, coacervates can both catalyze ribozyme reactions and provide product selectivity, demonstrating that coacervates could have functioned as enzyme-like catalytic microcompartments at the origins of life.","date":"2024-07-05","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.4c00114","accessDate":"2024-07-15T18:07:18Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","publicationTitle":"Accounts of Chemical Research","DOI":"10.1021/acs.accounts.4c00114","journalAbbreviation":"Acc.

A seemingly simple example is the formation of salt deposits during the evaporation of sessile droplets. These evaporites show great variations in their specific patterns including single rings, creep, small crystals, fractals, and featureless disks. We have explored the patterns of 42 different salts at otherwise constant conditions. Based on 7,500 images, we show that distinct pattern families can be identified and that some salts (e.g., Na2SO4 and NH4NO3) are bifurcated creating two distinct motifs. Family affiliations cannot be predicted a priori from composition alone but rather emerge from the complex interplay of evaporation, crystallization, thermodynamics, capillarity, and fluid flow.

These coacervates have been a subject of intense experimental and theoretical interest. Efforts to provide a physical description of complex coacervates have led to a number of theories that qualitatively (and sometimes quantitatively) agree with experimental data. However, this agreement often occurs in a degeneracy of models with profoundly different starting assumptions and different levels of sophistication. Theoretical difficulties in these systems are similar to those in most polyelectrolyte systems where charged species are highly correlated. These highly correlated systems can be described using liquid state (LS) integral equation theories, which surpass mean-field theories by providing information on local charge ordering. We extend these ideas to complex coacervate systems using PRISM-type theories and are able to capture effects not observable in traditional coacervate models, particularly connectivity and excluded volume effects. We can thus bridge two traditional but incommensurate theories meant to describe complex coacervates: the Voorn–Overbeek theory and counterion release. Importantly, we hypothesize that a cancellation of connectivity and excluded volume effects provides an explanation for the ability of Voorn–Overbeek theory to fit experimental data despite its well-known approximations.","date":"2015-07-28","shortTitle":"PRISM-Based Theory of Complex Coacervation","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.5b01027","accessDate":"2024-07-18T17:07:29Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"48","pages":"5040-5053","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.macromol.5b01027","issue":"14","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Sarah L.","lastName":"Perry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Charles E.","lastName":"Sing","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-18T17:07:29Z","dateModified":"2024-07-18T17:07:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/TDPBRMKS","itemID":7885,"attachments":[{"key":"Q3BU3HSJ","version":10766,"itemType":"attachment","title":"perry_sing-2015-prism-based_theory_of_complex_coacervation.pdf","parentItem":"TDPBRMKS","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/perry_sing-2015-prism-based_theory_of_complex_coacervation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-18T17:07:38Z","dateModified":"2024-07-18T17:07:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/Q3BU3HSJ","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/perry_sing-2015-prism-based_theory_of_complex_coacervation.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7887/perry_sing-2015-prism-based_theory_of_complex_coacervation.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084389,"version":0},"$loki":1899},{"itemID":7891,"item":{"key":"UJH8BERT","version":10904,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Zur Theorie der Elektrolyte.

Energy density, the figure of merit for electrostatic capacitors, is primarily determined by the choice of dielectric material. Most industry-grade polymer dielectrics are flexible polyolefins or rigid aromatics, possessing high energy density or high thermal stability, but not both. Here, we employ artificial intelligence (AI), established polymer chemistry, and molecular engineering to discover a suite of dielectrics in the polynorbornene and polyimide families. Many of the discovered dielectrics exhibit high thermal stability and high energy density over a broad temperature range. One such dielectric displays an energy density of 8.3 J cc−1 at 200 °C, a value 11 × that of any commercially available polymer dielectric at this temperature. We also evaluate pathways to further enhance the polynorbornene and polyimide families, enabling these capacitors to perform well in demanding applications (e.g., aerospace) while being environmentally sustainable. These findings expand the potential applications of electrostatic capacitors within the 85–200 °C temperature range, at which there is presently no good commercial solution. More broadly, this research demonstrates the impact of AI on chemical structure generation and property prediction, highlighting the potential for materials design advancement beyond electrostatic capacitors.","date":"2024-07-19","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50413-x","accessDate":"2024-07-22T14:43:59Z","rights":"2024 The Author(s)","extra":"Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"15","pages":"6107","publicationTitle":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-024-50413-x","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Commun","ISSN":"2041-1723","creators":[{"firstName":"Rishi","lastName":"Gurnani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stuti","lastName":"Shukla","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Kamal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Hao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Kuenneth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pritish","lastName":"Aklujkar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Khomane","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Daniels","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ajinkya A.","lastName":"Deshmukh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Cao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Sotzing","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rampi","lastName":"Ramprasad","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computational science","type":1},{"tag":"Materials for energy and catalysis","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-22T14:43:59Z","dateModified":"2024-07-22T14:44:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/NFJIKXMF","itemID":7892,"attachments":[{"key":"GKU5VY3S","version":11023,"itemType":"attachment","title":"gurnani_et_al-2024-ai-assisted_discovery_of_high-temperature_dielectrics_for_energy_storage.pdf","parentItem":"NFJIKXMF","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nat Commun/gurnani_et_al-2024-ai-assisted_discovery_of_high-temperature_dielectrics_for_energy_storage.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Understanding how polymers behave in solution (e.g., their solubility, chemical properties, etc.) can improve our control over material properties via their processing-structure–property relationships. For many decades the polymer science community has relied on thermodynamic and physics-based models to aid in this endeavor, but all rely on disparate data sets and use-case scenarios. Hence, there are still significant challenges to predict a priori the solubility of a polymer, whether it is for selecting sustainable solvents, obtaining thermodynamic parameters for phase separation, or navigating the coexistence curve. This perspective aims to discuss the different approaches of applying computational tools to predict polymer solubility, with a significant focus on machine learning techniques to capture the rapid progress in that space. We examine challenges and opportunities that remain for creating a comprehensive solubility toolset that can accelerate the design of a broad range of applications including films, membranes, and pharmaceuticals.","date":"2024-07-08","language":"en","shortTitle":"Predicting polymer solubility from phase diagrams to compatibility","libraryCatalog":"pubs.rsc.org","url":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/sm/d4sm00590b","accessDate":"2024-07-22T14:44:04Z","extra":"Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry","publicationTitle":"Soft Matter","DOI":"10.1039/D4SM00590B","journalAbbreviation":"Soft Matter","ISSN":"1744-6848","creators":[{"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Ethier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Evan R.","lastName":"Antoniuk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Blair","lastName":"Brettmann","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-22T14:44:04Z","dateModified":"2024-07-22T14:44:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/QN3VYEG6","itemID":7893,"attachments":[{"key":"DJSMZL2G","version":11023,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ethier_antoniuk_brettmann-2024-predicting_polymer_solubility_from_phase_diagrams_to_compatibility.pdf","parentItem":"QN3VYEG6","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Soft Matter/ethier_antoniuk_brettmann-2024-predicting_polymer_solubility_from_phase_diagrams_to_compatibility.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-22T14:44:09Z","dateModified":"2024-07-22T14:44:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/DJSMZL2G","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Soft Matter/ethier_antoniuk_brettmann-2024-predicting_polymer_solubility_from_phase_diagrams_to_compatibility.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7897/ethier_antoniuk_brettmann-2024-predicting_polymer_solubility_from_phase_diagrams_to_compatibility.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084391,"version":0},"$loki":1902},{"itemID":7898,"item":{"key":"IVMLLK9Q","version":11023,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Geometry-complete diffusion for 3D molecule generation and optimization","abstractNote":"Generative deep learning methods have recently been proposed for generating 3D molecules using equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) within a denoising diffusion framework. However, such methods are unable to learn important geometric properties of 3D molecules, as they adopt molecule-agnostic and non-geometric GNNs as their 3D graph denoising networks, which notably hinders their ability to generate valid large 3D molecules. In this work, we address these gaps by introducing the Geometry-Complete Diffusion Model (GCDM) for 3D molecule generation, which outperforms existing 3D molecular diffusion models by significant margins across conditional and unconditional settings for the QM9 dataset and the larger GEOM-Drugs dataset, respectively. Importantly, we demonstrate that GCDM’s generative denoising process enables the model to generate a significant proportion of valid and energetically-stable large molecules at the scale of GEOM-Drugs, whereas previous methods fail to do so with the features they learn. Additionally, we show that extensions of GCDM can not only effectively design 3D molecules for specific protein pockets but can be repurposed to consistently optimize the geometry and chemical composition of existing 3D molecules for molecular stability and property specificity, demonstrating new versatility of molecular diffusion models.

This statement is true, as far as we know, on our planet, but it is not clear whether it must hold throughout the cosmos. To evaluate that question requires a close consideration of the many varied and subtle roles that water plays in living cells—a consideration that must be free of both an assumed essentialism that gives water an almost mystical life-giving agency and a traditional tendency to see it as a merely passive solvent. Water is a participant in the “life of the cell,” and here I describe some of the features of that active agency. Water's value for molecular biology comes from both the structural and dynamic characteristics of its status as a complex, structured liquid as well as its nature as a polar, protic, and amphoteric reagent. Any discussion of water as life’s matrix must, however, begin with an acknowledgment that our understanding of it as both a liquid and a solvent is still incomplete.","date":"2017-12-19","libraryCatalog":"pnas.org (Atypon)","url":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1703781114","accessDate":"2024-07-22T21:44:40Z","extra":"Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"114","pages":"13327-13335","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1703781114","issue":"51","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","creators":[{"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Ball","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-22T21:44:40Z","dateModified":"2024-07-22T21:45:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/CLPSTNMH","itemID":7923,"attachments":[{"key":"F583MQS2","version":11152,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ball-2017-water_is_an_active_matrix_of_life_for_cell_and_molecular_biology.pdf","parentItem":"CLPSTNMH","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences/ball-2017-water_is_an_active_matrix_of_life_for_cell_and_molecular_biology.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-22T21:44:46Z","dateModified":"2024-07-22T21:44:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/F583MQS2","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences/ball-2017-water_is_an_active_matrix_of_life_for_cell_and_molecular_biology.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7925/ball-2017-water_is_an_active_matrix_of_life_for_cell_and_molecular_biology.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084393,"version":0},"$loki":1906},{"itemID":7926,"item":{"key":"2UG3VLNM","version":11220,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The theory of polymer solutions at intermediate concentration","abstractNote":"It is argued that polymer solutions can be classified into three broad types which may be characterized in terms of N the total number of (micro) molecules, n the number of polymer chains, l the effective length of a micromolecule, v the excluded volume per micromolecule and V the total volume.

We have measured this dielectric phenomenologically, in terms of the dielectric that needs to be used with the Born equation in order to reproduce the observed pKa shifts induced by burial of an ionizable group in the hydrophobic core of a protein. Mutants of staphylococcal nuclease with a buried lysine residue at position 66 were engineered for this purpose. The pKa values of buried lysines were measured by difference potentiometry. The extent of coupling between the pKa and the global stability of the protein was evaluated by measuring pKa values in hyperstable forms of nuclease engineered to be 3.3 or 6.5 kcal mol−1 more stable than the wild type. The crystallographic structure of one mutant was determined to describe the environment of the buried lysine. The dielectrics that were measured range from 10 to 12. Published pKa values of buried ionizable residues in other proteins were analyzed in a similar fashion and the dielectrics obtained from these values are consistent with the ones measured in nuclease. These results argue strongly against the prevalent use of dielectrics of 4 or lower to describe the dielectric effect inside a protein in structure-based calculations of electrostatic energies with continuum dielectric models.","date":"1997-02-28","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301462296022387","accessDate":"2024-07-23T19:03:00Z","volume":"64","pages":"211-224","publicationTitle":"Biophysical Chemistry","series":"10 Years of the Gibbs Conference on Biothermodynamics","DOI":"10.1016/S0301-4622(96)02238-7","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Biophysical Chemistry","ISSN":"0301-4622","creators":[{"firstName":"Bertrand E.","lastName":"García-Moreno","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John J.","lastName":"Dwyer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Apostolos G.","lastName":"Gittis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eaton E.","lastName":"Lattman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel S.","lastName":"Spencer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wesley E.","lastName":"Stites","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Electrostatics","type":1},{"tag":"Buried ionizable group","type":1},{"tag":"Dielectric inside a protein","type":1},{"tag":"Effective dielectric","type":1},{"tag":"Hydration","type":1},{"tag":"p in hydrophobic environment","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-23T19:03:00Z","dateModified":"2024-07-23T19:03:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/T46AYWXB","itemID":7930,"attachments":[{"key":"5E6SY5SM","version":11258,"itemType":"attachment","title":"garcía-moreno_et_al-1997-experimental_measurement_of_the_effective_dielectric_in_the_hydrophobic_core_of.pdf","parentItem":"T46AYWXB","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Biophysical Chemistry/garcía-moreno_et_al-1997-experimental_measurement_of_the_effective_dielectric_in_the_hydrophobic_core_of.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-23T19:50:40Z","dateModified":"2024-07-23T19:50:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/5E6SY5SM","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Biophysical Chemistry/garcía-moreno_et_al-1997-experimental_measurement_of_the_effective_dielectric_in_the_hydrophobic_core_of.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7936/garcía-moreno_et_al-1997-experimental_measurement_of_the_effective_dielectric_in_the_hydrophobic_core_of.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084394,"version":0},"$loki":1908},{"itemID":7931,"item":{"key":"9CQGIWJU","version":11246,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A molecular-thermodynamic model for polyelectrolyte solutions","abstractNote":"Polyelectrolyte solutions are modeled as freely tangent-jointed, charged hard-sphere chains and corresponding counterions in a continuum medium with permitivity ε.

To estimate the magnitudes of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes, concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential or stationary growth phase are estimated to be ≈0.3 to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules that emulate the crowding conditions inferred for cytoplasm is discussed.","date":"1991-12-05","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002228369190499V","accessDate":"2024-07-23T23:45:02Z","volume":"222","pages":"599-620","publicationTitle":"Journal of Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.1016/0022-2836(91)90499-V","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Molecular Biology","ISSN":"0022-2836","creators":[{"firstName":"Steven B.","lastName":"Zimmerman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefan O.","lastName":"Trach","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"proteins","type":1},{"tag":"cytoplasm","type":1},{"tag":"excluded volume","type":1},{"tag":"macromolecular crowding","type":1},{"tag":"metabolic buffering","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-23T23:45:02Z","dateModified":"2024-07-23T23:45:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/P5GERP8R","itemID":7938,"attachments":[{"key":"UIPZDZJM","version":11305,"itemType":"attachment","title":"zimmerman_trach-1991-estimation_of_macromolecule_concentrations_and_excluded_volume_effects_for_the.pdf","parentItem":"P5GERP8R","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Journal of Molecular Biology/zimmerman_trach-1991-estimation_of_macromolecule_concentrations_and_excluded_volume_effects_for_the2.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-23T23:45:39Z","dateModified":"2024-07-23T23:46:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/UIPZDZJM","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Journal of Molecular Biology/zimmerman_trach-1991-estimation_of_macromolecule_concentrations_and_excluded_volume_effects_for_the2.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7942/zimmerman_trach-1991-estimation_of_macromolecule_concentrations_and_excluded_volume_effects_for_the2.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084396,"version":0},"$loki":1911},{"itemID":7943,"item":{"key":"M37TTJAW","version":11318,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Mechanics of the Nucleus","abstractNote":"The nucleus is the distinguishing feature of eukaryotic cells. Until recently, it was often considered simply as a unique compartment containing the genetic information of the cell and associated machinery, without much attention to its structure and mechanical properties. This article provides compelling examples that illustrate how specific nuclear structures are associated with important cellular functions, and how defects in nuclear mechanics can cause a multitude of human diseases. During differentiation, embryonic stem cells modify their nuclear envelope composition and chromatin structure, resulting in stiffer nuclei that reflect decreased transcriptional plasticity. In contrast, neutrophils have evolved characteristic lobulated nuclei that increase their physical plasticity, enabling passage through narrow tissue spaces in their response to inflammation. Research on diverse cell types further demonstrates how induced nuclear deformations during cellular compression or stretch can modulate cellular function. Pathological examples of disturbed nuclear mechanics include the many diseases caused by mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C and associated proteins, as well as cancer cells that are often characterized by abnormal nuclear morphology. In this article, we will focus on determining the functional relationship between nuclear mechanics and cellular (dys-)function, describing the molecular changes associated with physiological and pathological examples, the resulting defects in nuclear mechanics, and the effects on cellular function. New insights into the close relationship between nuclear mechanics and cellular organization and function will yield a better understanding of normal biology and will offer new clues into therapeutic approaches to the various diseases associated with defective nuclear mechanics.","date":"2011-4","libraryCatalog":"PubMed Central","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600468/","accessDate":"2024-07-23T23:56:47Z","extra":"PMID: 23737203\nPMCID: PMC4600468","volume":"1","pages":"783-807","publicationTitle":"Comprehensive Physiology","DOI":"10.1002/cphy.c100038","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Compr Physiol","ISSN":"2040-4603","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Lammerding","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-23T23:56:47Z","dateModified":"2024-07-23T23:56:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/M37TTJAW","itemID":7943,"attachments":[{"key":"NLHPKZAW","version":11318,"itemType":"attachment","title":"lammerding-2011-mechanics_of_the_nucleus.pdf","parentItem":"M37TTJAW","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Compr Physiol/lammerding-2011-mechanics_of_the_nucleus.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-23T23:56:57Z","dateModified":"2024-07-23T23:56:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/NLHPKZAW","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Compr Physiol/lammerding-2011-mechanics_of_the_nucleus.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7946/lammerding-2011-mechanics_of_the_nucleus.pdf"},{"key":"P5GAP525","version":11318,"itemType":"attachment","title":"PubMed Central Link","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600468/","accessDate":"2024-07-23T23:56:48Z","parentItem":"M37TTJAW","linkMode":"linked_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-23T23:56:48Z","dateModified":"2024-07-23T23:56:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/P5GAP525"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084397,"version":0},"$loki":1912},{"itemID":7947,"item":{"key":"BVG5ZHKQ","version":11411,"itemType":"preprint","title":"A foundation model for atomistic materials chemistry","abstractNote":"Machine-learned force fields have transformed the atomistic modelling of materials by enabling simulations of ab initio quality on unprecedented time and length scales.

Here, using the state-of-the-art MACE architecture we introduce a single general-purpose ML model, trained on a public database of 150k inorganic crystals, that is capable of running stable molecular dynamics on molecules and materials. We demonstrate the power of the MACE-MP-0 model - and its qualitative and at times quantitative accuracy - on a diverse set problems in the physical sciences, including the properties of solids, liquids, gases, chemical reactions, interfaces and even the dynamics of a small protein.

In this review, we give a broad overview of recent scoring function development, as well as the docking-based applications in drug discovery. We outline the strategies and resources available for structure-based VS and discuss the assessment and development of classical and machine learning protein–ligand scoring functions. In particular, we highlight the recent progress of machine learning scoring function ranging from descriptor-based models to deep learning approaches. We also discuss the general workflow and docking protocols of structure-based VS, such as structure preparation, binding site detection, docking strategies, and post-docking filter/re-scoring, as well as a case study on the large-scale docking-based VS test on the LIT-PCBA data set.","date":"2022/1","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/14/4568","accessDate":"2024-07-24T16:12:09Z","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","extra":"Number: 14\nPublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","volume":"27","pages":"4568","publicationTitle":"Molecules","DOI":"10.3390/molecules27144568","issue":"14","ISSN":"1420-3049","creators":[{"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eric Anthony","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yingkai","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"deep learning","type":1},{"tag":"machine learning","type":1},{"tag":"datasets","type":1},{"tag":"molecular docking","type":1},{"tag":"protein–ligand scoring function","type":1},{"tag":"virtual screening","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-24T16:12:09Z","dateModified":"2024-07-24T16:12:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/IPF85HJE","itemID":7955,"attachments":[{"key":"33KNPUWZ","version":11385,"itemType":"attachment","title":"yang_chen_zhang-2022-protein–ligand_docking_in_the_machine-learning_era.pdf","parentItem":"IPF85HJE","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Molecules/yang_chen_zhang-2022-protein–ligand_docking_in_the_machine-learning_era.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-24T16:12:25Z","dateModified":"2024-07-24T16:12:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/33KNPUWZ","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Molecules/yang_chen_zhang-2022-protein–ligand_docking_in_the_machine-learning_era.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7957/yang_chen_zhang-2022-protein–ligand_docking_in_the_machine-learning_era.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841084399,"version":0},"$loki":1916},{"itemID":7961,"item":{"key":"KKSK6GKT","version":11404,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","abstractNote":"We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.3 million high-resolution images in the LSVRC-2010 ImageNet training set into the 1000 different classes.

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 500,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and two globally connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of convolutional nets.

We know from the fact that proteins may be crystallized and further from x-ray crystallography that each atom occupies a unique place in the relative 3dimensional space of the molecule. If we consider a protein containing 2,000 atoms with no structural restrictions, such a macromolecule would possess 6,000 degrees of freedom. We know, however, from x-ray studies and other techniques as well, that there are indeed certain structural restrictions in a polypeptide structure.

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.","date":"2017","libraryCatalog":"Neural Information Processing Systems","url":"https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/8a20a8621978632d76c43dfd28b67767-Abstract.html","accessDate":"2023-05-01T16:14:54Z","proceedingsTitle":"31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Scott M","lastName":"Lundberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Su-In","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","UF75T3ZQ","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2023-05-01T16:14:54Z","dateModified":"2024-07-24T17:18:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/LEX3F39P","itemID":3133,"attachments":[{"key":"VJ42CMWY","version":7050,"itemType":"attachment","title":"lundberg_lee-2017-a_unified_approach_to_interpreting_model_predictions.pdf","parentItem":"LEX3F39P","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Conference Paper/Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems/lundberg_lee-2017-a_unified_approach_to_interpreting_model_predictions.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:24:09Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:18Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/VJ42CMWY","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Conference Paper/Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems/lundberg_lee-2017-a_unified_approach_to_interpreting_model_predictions.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5123/lundberg_lee-2017-a_unified_approach_to_interpreting_model_predictions.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841510110,"version":0},"$loki":1922},{"itemID":2546,"item":{"key":"CFRANPE6","version":8931,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Coacervation (Partial Miscibility in Colloid Systems)","date":"1929","volume":"32","pages":"849-856","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie Van Wetenschappen","creators":[{"firstName":"Hendrik G.","lastName":"Bungenberg de Jong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hugo R.","lastName":"Kruyt","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-07-28T16:42:29Z","dateModified":"2024-07-24T17:18:32Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/CFRANPE6","itemID":2546,"attachments":[{"key":"LMHBQBKW","version":10817,"itemType":"attachment","title":"bungenberg_de_jong_kruyt-1929-coacervation_(partial_miscibility_in_colloid_systems).pdf","parentItem":"CFRANPE6","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Proceedings of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie Van Wetenschappen/bungenberg_de_jong_kruyt-1929-coacervation_(partial_miscibility_in_colloid_systems).pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-18T21:18:56Z","dateModified":"2024-07-18T21:19:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/LMHBQBKW","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Proceedings of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie Van Wetenschappen/bungenberg_de_jong_kruyt-1929-coacervation_(partial_miscibility_in_colloid_systems).pdf","defaultPath":"files/7888/bungenberg_de_jong_kruyt-1929-coacervation_(partial_miscibility_in_colloid_systems).pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721841514339,"version":0},"$loki":1923},{"itemID":7967,"item":{"key":"SBSWNM62","version":11424,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Protein–ligand docking: Current status and future challenges","abstractNote":"Understanding the ruling principles whereby protein receptors recognize, interact, and associate with molecular substrates and inhibitors is of paramount importance in drug discovery efforts. Protein–ligand docking aims to predict and rank the structure(s) arising from the association between a given ligand and a target protein of known 3D structure. Despite the breathtaking advances in the field over the last decades and the widespread application of docking methods, several downsides still exist. In particular, protein flexibility—a critical aspect for a thorough understanding of the principles that guide ligand binding in proteins—is a major hurdle in current protein–ligand docking efforts that needs to be more efficiently accounted for. In this review the key concepts of protein–ligand docking methods are outlined, with major emphasis being given to the general strengths and weaknesses that presently characterize this methodology. Despite the size of the field, the principal types of search algorithms and scoring functions are reviewed and the most popular docking tools are briefly depicted. Recent advances that aim to address some of the traditional limitations associated with molecular docking are also described. A selection of hand-picked examples is used to illustrate these features.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.","date":"2020","url":"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Abstract.html","extra":"ISSN: 23318422\n_eprint: 2005.14165","place":"Vancouver,BC,Canada","proceedingsTitle":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33","creators":[{"firstName":"Tom B.","lastName":"Brown","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Mann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Ryder","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Melanie","lastName":"Subbiah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jared","lastName":"Kaplan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Prafulla","lastName":"Dhariwal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Neelakantan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pranav","lastName":"Shyam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Girish","lastName":"Sastry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amanda","lastName":"Askell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sandhini","lastName":"Agarwal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ariel","lastName":"Herbert-Voss","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gretchen","lastName":"Krueger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Henighan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rewon","lastName":"Child","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Ramesh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel M.","lastName":"Ziegler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Wu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Winter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Hesse","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Sigler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mateusz","lastName":"Litwin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Gray","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Chess","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Clark","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Berner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"McCandlish","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alec","lastName":"Radford","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Sutskever","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Amodei","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-30T20:20:20Z","dateModified":"2024-07-24T22:33:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/PI5CDGJI","itemID":1240,"attachments":[{"key":"PTGSL2EB","version":5140,"itemType":"attachment","title":"brown_et_al-2020-language_models_are_few-shot_learners.pdf","parentItem":"PI5CDGJI","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Conference Paper/NIPS 2020/brown_et_al-2020-language_models_are_few-shot_learners.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:03:23Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T19:03:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/PTGSL2EB","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Conference Paper/NIPS 2020/brown_et_al-2020-language_models_are_few-shot_learners.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4834/brown_et_al-2020-language_models_are_few-shot_learners.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721860436624,"version":0},"$loki":1932},{"itemID":7977,"item":{"key":"2P5MIX7I","version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity","abstractNote":"In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model---with an outrageous number of parameters---but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages.

The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.","date":"2019-02-01","shortTitle":"Physics-informed neural networks","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125","accessDate":"2024-03-21T16:23:50Z","volume":"378","pages":"686-707","publicationTitle":"Journal of Computational Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Computational Physics","ISSN":"0021-9991","creators":[{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Raissi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Perdikaris","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"G.

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.","date":"2021-06","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00314-5","accessDate":"2024-03-22T13:41:50Z","rights":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","extra":"Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"3","pages":"422-440","publicationTitle":"Nature Reviews Physics","DOI":"10.1038/s42254-021-00314-5","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Rev Phys","ISSN":"2522-5820","creators":[{"firstName":"George Em","lastName":"Karniadakis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ioannis G.","lastName":"Kevrekidis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Lu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paris","lastName":"Perdikaris","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sifan","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computational science","type":1},{"tag":"Applied mathematics","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-22T13:41:50Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T13:41:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/E8U658YC","itemID":7094,"attachments":[{"key":"Z9EXZC2Q","version":7507,"itemType":"attachment","title":"karniadakis_et_al-2021-physics-informed_machine_learning.pdf","parentItem":"E8U658YC","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nat Rev Phys/karniadakis_et_al-2021-physics-informed_machine_learning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-22T13:42:45Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T13:42:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/Z9EXZC2Q","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Nat Rev Phys/karniadakis_et_al-2021-physics-informed_machine_learning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7099/karniadakis_et_al-2021-physics-informed_machine_learning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721860808281,"version":0},"$loki":1942},{"itemID":984,"item":{"key":"TG2872G3","version":410,"itemType":"book","title":"The Elements of Statistical Learning","date":"2009","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7","extra":"ISSN: 09528385","place":"New York, NY","publisher":"Springer","ISBN":"978-0-387-84857-0","series":"Springer Series in Statistics","edition":"2","creators":[{"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Hastie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Tibshirani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Friedman","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/AUBAP9F4"]},"dateAdded":"2021-07-30T15:47:24Z","dateModified":"2021-07-30T20:54:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/TG2872G3","itemID":984,"attachments":[{"key":"M3SVUKH8","version":7048,"itemType":"attachment","title":"hastie_tibshirani_friedman-2009-the_elements_of_statistical_learning.pdf","parentItem":"TG2872G3","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Book/undefined/hastie_tibshirani_friedman-2009-the_elements_of_statistical_learning.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T19:20:15Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/M3SVUKH8","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Book/undefined/hastie_tibshirani_friedman-2009-the_elements_of_statistical_learning.pdf","defaultPath":"files/5012/hastie_tibshirani_friedman-2009-the_elements_of_statistical_learning.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721863897754,"version":0},"$loki":1943},{"itemID":6246,"item":{"key":"EC65RL2G","version":6188,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Phase Behavior and Coacervation of Aqueous Poly(acrylic acid)−Poly(allylamine) Solutions","abstractNote":"Phase separation and coacervate complex formation of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) were investigated as model pair of oppositely charged, weak polyelectrolytes in aqueous solution. Both fully or partially neutralized PAA (sodium polyacrylate) and PAH were employed. Important factors affecting the complexation were systematically varied including the polyacid/polybase mixing ratio (10−90 wt %), ionic strength as salt concentration (0−4700 mM), polymer concentration (0.02−2.0 wt %), pH (5 and 7), and temperature (30−75 °C). Sample turbidity was utilized as an indicator of polyelectrolyte complex formation. Phase separation in the solution was also observed by optical microscopy in the distinguishable forms of either precipitate or coacervate. In the absence of salt, polyelectrolyte complexation always resulted in the formation of a precipitate. In the presence of sodium chloride, complex formation does not take place (neither precipitate nor coacervate) when either polyelectrolyte is present in large excess. Increasing salt concentration causes a change from solid precipitate to fluid coacervate phase, and finally a one-phase polyelectrolyte solution is obtained. Temperature affected the precipitate-to-solution transition only in the case of samples with low concentrations of either PAA or PAH. The data generated led to the construction of phase diagrams that illustrate how the various parameters control the demixing and the precipitate−coacervate−solution phase transitions. We find such phase diagrams for simple, flexible synthetic macromolecular systems to be rare in the polymer science literature. Ternary phase diagrams were prepared, which showed the influence of relative polymer and salt concentration on the phase behavior of the aqueous PAA/PAH system. We believe data such as these will both improve both the reliable applications of polymer coacervates and the development of new macromolecular assemblies based on charge complexation.","date":"2010-03-09","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ma902144k","accessDate":"2024-03-21T15:34:00Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"43","pages":"2518-2528","publicationTitle":"Macromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/ma902144k","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Macromolecules","ISSN":"0024-9297","creators":[{"firstName":"Rungsima","lastName":"Chollakup","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wirasak","lastName":"Smitthipong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Claus D.","lastName":"Eisenbach","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tirrell","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T15:34:01Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T15:34:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/EC65RL2G","itemID":6246,"attachments":[{"key":"WA62NFLC","version":7062,"itemType":"attachment","title":"chollakup_et_al-2010-phase_behavior_and_coacervation_of_aqueous_poly(acrylic_acid)−poly(allylamine).pdf","parentItem":"EC65RL2G","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Macromolecules/chollakup_et_al-2010-phase_behavior_and_coacervation_of_aqueous_poly(acrylic_acid)−poly(allylamine).pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T15:34:05Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/WA62NFLC","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Macromolecules/chollakup_et_al-2010-phase_behavior_and_coacervation_of_aqueous_poly(acrylic_acid)−poly(allylamine).pdf","defaultPath":"files/6250/chollakup_et_al-2010-phase_behavior_and_coacervation_of_aqueous_poly(acrylic_acid)−poly(allylamine).pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721873167268,"version":0},"$loki":1944},{"itemID":6147,"item":{"key":"4BTHKZQE","version":6015,"itemType":"book","title":"Polymer Physics","date":"2003","libraryCatalog":"Library of Congress ISBN","callNumber":"QC173.4.P65 R83 2003","place":"Oxford ;

There is obtained for the entropy of mixing of n solvent and N linear polymer molecules (originally disoriented), ΔS=−k[(n/β) ln v1+N ln v2] where v1 and v2 are volume fractions and β is the number of solvent molecules replaceable by a freely orienting segment of the polymer chain. This expression is similar in form to the classical expression for equal‐sized molecules, mole fractions having been replaced by volume fractions. When the disparity between the sizes of the two components is great, this expression gives entropies differing widely from the classical values, which accounts for the large deviations of high polymer solutions from ``ideal'' behavior. The entropy of disorientation of a perfectly arranged linear polymer is found to be of the order of R cal. per chain segment. After introducing a suitable heat of mixing term, partial molal free energies are computed, and the calculations are compared with experimental data for all concentrations. Phase equilibria have been calculated in the region of partial miscibility. The theory predicts, in agreement with experiment, that the critical composition for partial miscibility lies at a low concentration of polymer. Low intrinsic viscosities of polymers dissolved in poor solvents are attributed to the tendency for the molecule to assume a more compact configuration in such an environment.","date":"1942","language":"en","archiveLocation":"world","libraryCatalog":"aip.scitation.org","url":"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1723621","accessDate":"2022-03-09T21:01:56Z","rights":"© 1942 American Institute of Physics.","extra":"Publisher: American Institute of PhysicsAIP","volume":"10","pages":"51","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.1723621","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"J Chem Phys","ISSN":"0021-9606","creators":[{"firstName":"Paul J.","lastName":"Flory","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/WHH4RQUR"]},"dateAdded":"2022-03-09T21:01:56Z","dateModified":"2024-07-25T15:11:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/EWG56A6I","itemID":2102,"attachments":[{"key":"HIYDQPGI","version":7441,"itemType":"attachment","title":"flory-1942-thermodynamics_of_high_polymer_solutions.pdf","parentItem":"EWG56A6I","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/J Chem Phys/flory-1942-thermodynamics_of_high_polymer_solutions.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/E34W7N7E"]},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:47:23Z","dateModified":"2024-07-25T15:11:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/HIYDQPGI","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/J Chem Phys/flory-1942-thermodynamics_of_high_polymer_solutions.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4634/flory-1942-thermodynamics_of_high_polymer_solutions.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721920299766,"version":0},"$loki":1950},{"itemID":1980,"item":{"key":"GVGETWZR","version":10896,"itemType":"book","title":"Principles of Polymer Chemistry","date":"1953","language":"en","publisher":"Cornell University Press","ISBN":"978-0-8014-0134-3","edition":"1st","numPages":"688","creators":[{"firstName":"Paul J.","lastName":"Flory","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-10-25T14:28:24Z","dateModified":"2024-07-18T22:14:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/GVGETWZR","itemID":1980,"attachments":[{"key":"BTGZSWJD","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"flory-1953-principles_of_polymer_chemistry.pdf","parentItem":"GVGETWZR","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Book/flory-1953-principles_of_polymer_chemistry.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-25T21:27:41Z","dateModified":"2024-07-25T21:27:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/BTGZSWJD","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Book/flory-1953-principles_of_polymer_chemistry.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7987/flory-1953-principles_of_polymer_chemistry.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721942870750,"version":0},"$loki":1952},{"itemID":6148,"item":{"key":"39245UF8","version":9806,"itemType":"book","title":"Physics of Charged Macromolecules: Synthetic and Biological Systems","abstractNote":"\"A concise introduction to the physics of charged macromolecules, from the basics of electrostatics to cutting-edge modern research developments.

Here we show that microphase separation, long studied in polymeric materials and other inert systems, has a natural counterpart in living cells. When placed below a millimetric film of liquid nutritive medium, a quasi two-dimensional, high-density population of Dictyostelium discoideum cells spontaneously assembles into compact domains. Their typical size of 100 μm is governed by a balance between competing interactions: an adhesion acting as a short-range attraction and promoting aggregation, and an effective long-range repulsion stemming from aerotaxis in near anoxic condition. Experimental data, a simple model and cell-based simulations all support this scenario. Our findings establish a generic mechanism for self-organization of living cells and highlight oxygen regulation as an emergent organizing principle for biological matter.","date":"2023-02-13","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36395-2","accessDate":"2024-07-26T03:13:52Z","rights":"2023 The Author(s)","extra":"Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","volume":"14","pages":"796","publicationTitle":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-023-36395-2","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Commun","ISSN":"2041-1723","creators":[{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Carrère","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"d’Alessandro","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"O.","lastName":"Cochet-Escartin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Hesnard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"N.","lastName":"Ghazi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"C.","lastName":"Rivière","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"C.","lastName":"Anjard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"F.","lastName":"Detcheverry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.-P.","lastName":"Rieu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Biological physics","type":1},{"tag":"Cellular motility","type":1}],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-26T03:13:52Z","dateModified":"2024-07-26T03:13:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/4CT8TN37","itemID":7988,"attachments":[{"key":"CE8867J7","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"carrère_et_al.-2023-microphase_separation_of_living_cells.pdf","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36395-2.pdf","accessDate":"2024-07-26T03:13:54Z","parentItem":"4CT8TN37","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Nature Communications/carrère_et_al.-2023-microphase_separation_of_living_cells.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-26T03:13:54Z","dateModified":"2024-07-26T03:13:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/CE8867J7","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Nature Communications/carrère_et_al.-2023-microphase_separation_of_living_cells.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7990/carrère_et_al.-2023-microphase_separation_of_living_cells.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721963642164,"version":0},"$loki":1955},{"itemID":6194,"item":{"key":"MSG8J6JA","version":6150,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Lower Critical Solution Temperature in Polyelectrolyte Complex Coacervates","abstractNote":"A model linear oppositely charged polyelectrolyte complex exhibits phase separation upon heating consistent with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. The LCST coexistence curves narrow with increasing monovalent salt concentration (Cs) that reduces the polymer concentration (Cp) in the polymer-rich phase. The polymer-rich phase exhibits less hydration with increasing temperature, while an increase in Cs increases the hydration extent. The apparent critical temperature, taken as the minimum in the phase diagram, occurs only for a narrow range of Cs. Mean field theory suggests an increasing Bjerrum length with temperature can lead to an electrostatic-driven LCST; however, the temperature dependence of the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter and solvation effects must also be considered.","date":"2019-03-19","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmacrolett.8b00952","accessDate":"2024-03-21T15:25:43Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"8","pages":"289-293","publicationTitle":"ACS Macro Letters","DOI":"10.1021/acsmacrolett.8b00952","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"ACS Macro Lett.","creators":[{"firstName":"Samim","lastName":"Ali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Bleuel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vivek M.","lastName":"Prabhu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T15:25:44Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T15:25:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/MSG8J6JA","itemID":6194,"attachments":[{"key":"NB6338IA","version":7060,"itemType":"attachment","title":"ali_bleuel_prabhu-2019-lower_critical_solution_temperature_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervates.pdf","parentItem":"MSG8J6JA","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/ACS Macro Lett./ali_bleuel_prabhu-2019-lower_critical_solution_temperature_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervates.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T15:25:47Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/NB6338IA","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/ACS Macro Lett./ali_bleuel_prabhu-2019-lower_critical_solution_temperature_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervates.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6196/ali_bleuel_prabhu-2019-lower_critical_solution_temperature_in_polyelectrolyte_complex_coacervates.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1721965008502,"version":0},"$loki":1956},{"itemID":5723,"item":{"key":"TUJI5NY7","version":6506,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"Nelder, Mead, and the other simplex method","date":"2012","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://ems.press/doi/10.4171/dms/6/29","accessDate":"2024-03-20T20:33:14Z","place":"Berlin, Germany","publisher":"EMS Press","ISBN":"978-3-936609-58-5 978-3-9854754-0-7","pages":"271-276","proceedingsTitle":"21st International Symposium on Mathematical Programming","DOI":"10.4171/dms/6/29","creators":[{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Grötschel","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Margaret H.","lastName":"Wright","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T20:33:14Z","dateModified":"2024-03-20T20:34:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/TUJI5NY7","itemID":5723,"attachments":[{"key":"76V4S5CR","version":7063,"itemType":"attachment","title":"wright-2012-nelder,_mead,_and_the_other_simplex_method.pdf","parentItem":"TUJI5NY7","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Conference Paper/21st International Symposium on Mathematical Programming/wright-2012-nelder,_mead,_and_the_other_simplex_method.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-21T18:48:39Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:08:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/76V4S5CR","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Conference Paper/21st International Symposium on Mathematical Programming/wright-2012-nelder,_mead,_and_the_other_simplex_method.pdf","defaultPath":"files/6856/wright-2012-nelder,_mead,_and_the_other_simplex_method.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1722000095022,"version":0},"$loki":1957},{"itemID":7991,"item":{"key":"NPGT2Z6K","version":0,"itemType":"book","title":"Computer-Aided Graphing and Simulation Tools for AutoCAD Users","abstractNote":"This book allows readers to expand the versatility of AutoCAD design and documentation software.

New techniques have added capabilities that far surpass those of the early methods. Modern classification trees can partition the data with linear splits on subsets of variables and fit nearest neighbor, kernel density, and other models in the partitions. Regression trees can fit almost every kind of traditional statistical model, including least-squares, quantile, logistic, Poisson, and proportional hazards models, as well as models for longitudinal and multiresponse data. Greater availability and affordability of software (much of which is free) have played a significant role in helping the techniques gain acceptance and popularity in the broader scientific community.

A variational approach is utilized to predict average distance between any two monomers in the chain. The presented analytical model, for the first time, explicitly incorporates the role of sequence charge distribution to determine relative sizes between two sequences that vary not only in total charge composition but also in charge decoration (even when charge composition is fixed). Furthermore, the formalism is general enough to allow variation in excluded volume interactions between two monomers. Model predictions are benchmarked against the all-atom Monte Carlo studies of Das and Pappu [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 110, 13392 (2013)] for 30 different synthetic sequences of polyampholytes. These sequences possess an equal number of glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K) residues but differ in the patterning within the sequence. Without any fit parameter, the model captures the strong sequence dependence of the simulated values of the radius of gyration with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9. The model is then applied to real proteins to compare the unfolded state dimensions of 540 orthologous pairs of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins. The excluded volume parameters are assumed similar under denatured conditions, and only electrostatic effects encoded in the sequence are accounted for. With these assumptions, thermophilic proteins are found—with high statistical significance—to have more compact disordered ensemble compared to their mesophilic counterparts. The method presented here, due to its analytical nature, is capable of making such high throughput analysis of multiple proteins and will have broad applications in proteomic studies as well as in other heteropolymeric systems.","date":"2015-08-28","libraryCatalog":"Silverchair","url":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4929391","accessDate":"2024-04-10T21:18:57Z","volume":"143","pages":"085101","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.4929391","issue":"8","journalAbbreviation":"J Chem Phys","ISSN":"0021-9606","creators":[{"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Sawle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kingshuk","lastName":"Ghosh","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","5Y7FL4MQ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-04-10T21:18:57Z","dateModified":"2024-06-18T15:31:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/WT4SFGK6","itemID":7263,"attachments":[{"key":"V3ZE8CVL","version":7879,"itemType":"attachment","title":"sawle_ghosh-2015-a_theoretical_method_to_compute_sequence_dependent_configurational_properties.pdf","parentItem":"WT4SFGK6","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/The Journal of Chemical Physics/sawle_ghosh-2015-a_theoretical_method_to_compute_sequence_dependent_configurational_properties.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-04-10T21:19:01Z","dateModified":"2024-04-10T21:19:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/V3ZE8CVL","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/The Journal of Chemical Physics/sawle_ghosh-2015-a_theoretical_method_to_compute_sequence_dependent_configurational_properties.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7267/sawle_ghosh-2015-a_theoretical_method_to_compute_sequence_dependent_configurational_properties.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1722454252819,"version":0},"$loki":1979},{"itemID":2853,"item":{"key":"EUXB88SI","version":8937,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Micro- to macro-phase separation transition in sequence-defined coacervates","abstractNote":"Phase separation can be driven by the association of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in solution, a process known as complex coacervation. This can manifest as macrophase separation, which arises when both polymer species are homopolyelectrolytes, or can lead to microphase separation when one or both of the charged species are block copolyelectrolytes. This is not a strict dichotomy; recently, macrophase separation was observed for a number of copolymers containing sequence-defined patterns of neutral vs charged monomers, including patterns with lengthy blocks. The specific pattern can affect the strength of this macrophase separation, yet at some block length, microphase separation is expected to emerge. In this article, we describe how to incorporate a theory of sequence-defined coacervation into self-consistent field theory, allowing the study of sequence-defined polyelectrolytes in inhomogeneous systems. We show that blocky sequences can affect electrostatically driven macrophase separation and can transition to microphase separation as the blockiness of sequences increases. This micro- to macrophase separation transition is a function of both the blockiness of the sequence, the number of blocks, and the concentration of salt.","date":"2020-01-14","libraryCatalog":"aip.scitation.org (Atypon)","url":"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5140756","accessDate":"2022-09-20T17:18:26Z","extra":"Publisher: American Institute of Physics","volume":"152","pages":"024902","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.5140756","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"J Chem Phys","ISSN":"0021-9606","creators":[{"firstName":"Charles E.","lastName":"Sing","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["E8YWNDJX","BDGJ6388","5Y7FL4MQ","HHS3REWH"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-09-20T17:18:26Z","dateModified":"2024-03-22T00:11:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/EUXB88SI","itemID":2853,"attachments":[{"key":"CWAMBJJ6","version":7440,"itemType":"attachment","title":"sing-2020-micro-_to_macro-phase_separation_transition_in_sequence-defined_coacervates.pdf","parentItem":"EUXB88SI","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/J Chem Phys/sing-2020-micro-_to_macro-phase_separation_transition_in_sequence-defined_coacervates.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-03-20T18:38:57Z","dateModified":"2024-03-21T22:11:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/CWAMBJJ6","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/J Chem Phys/sing-2020-micro-_to_macro-phase_separation_transition_in_sequence-defined_coacervates.pdf","defaultPath":"files/4533/sing-2020-micro-_to_macro-phase_separation_transition_in_sequence-defined_coacervates.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1722531057441,"version":0},"$loki":1982},{"itemID":7311,"item":{"key":"9NL9SSEC","version":10191,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"100th Anniversary of Macromolecular Science Viewpoint: Opportunities in the Physics of Sequence-Defined Polymers","abstractNote":"Polymer science has been driven by ever-increasing molecular complexity, as polymer synthesis expands an already-vast palette of chemical and architectural parameter space.

Determining the ensemble of conformations that IDPs explore under physiological conditions is the first step toward understanding their diverse cellular functions. Here, we quantitatively characterize the structural features of IDPs as a function of sequence and length using coarse-grained simulations. For diverse IDP sequences, with the number of residues (NT) ranging from 20 to 441, our simulations not only reproduce the radii of gyration (Rg) obtained from experiments, but also predict the full scattering intensity profiles in excellent agreement with small-angle X-ray scattering experiments. The Rg values are well-described by the standard Flory scaling law, Rg = Rg0NTν, with ν ≈ 0.588, making it tempting to assert that IDPs behave as polymers in a good solvent. However, clustering analysis reveals that the menagerie of structures explored by IDPs is diverse, with the extent of heterogeneity being highly sequence-dependent, even though ensemble-averaged properties, such as the dependence of Rg on chain length, may suggest synthetic polymer-like behavior in a good solvent. For example, we show that for the highly charged Prothymosin-α, a substantial fraction of conformations is highly compact. Even if the sequence compositions are similar, as is the case for α-Synuclein and a truncated construct from the Tau protein, there are substantial differences in the conformational heterogeneity. Taken together, these observations imply that metrics based on net charge or related quantities alone cannot be used to anticipate the phases of IDPs, either in isolation or in complex with partner IDPs or RNA. Our work sets the stage for probing the interactions of IDPs with each other, with folded protein domains, or with partner RNAs, which are critical for describing the structures of stress granules and biomolecular condensates with important cellular functions.","date":"2019-04-25","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b02575","accessDate":"2024-06-14T23:29:31Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"123","pages":"3462-3474","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry B","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b02575","issue":"16","journalAbbreviation":"J.

This phenomenon is driven by the electrostatic attraction between polyanion and polycation species, leading to the formation of a polymer-dense coacervate phase and a coexisting polymer-dilute supernatant phase. There has been significant recent interest in the physical origin and features of coacervation; yet notably, experiments often use weak polyelectrolytes the charge state of which depends on solution pH, while theoretical or computational efforts typically assume strong polyelectrolytes that remain fully charged. There have been only a few efforts to address this limitation, and thus there has been little exploration of how pH can affect complex coacervation. In this paper, we modify a transfer matrix theory of coacervation to account for acid–base equilibria, taking advantage of its ability to directly account for some local ion correlations that will affect monomer charging. We show that coacervation can stabilize the charged state of a weak polyelectrolyte via the proximity of oppositely charged monomers, and can lead to asymmetric phase diagrams where the positively and negatively charged polyelectrolytes exhibit different behaviors near the pKa of either chain. Specifically, there is a partitioning of one of the salt species to a coacervate to maintain electroneutrality when one of the polyelectrolytes is only partially charged. This results in the depletion of the same salt species in the supernatant, and overall can suppress phase separation. We also demonstrate that, when one of the species is only partially charged, mixtures that are off-stoichiometric in volume fraction but stoichiometric in charge exhibit the greatest propensity to form coacervate phases.","date":"2021-08-12","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c03065","accessDate":"2024-06-11T22:15:46Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"125","pages":"8965-8980","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry B","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c03065","issue":"31","journalAbbreviation":"J.

Here, we investigate the driving forces of such interactions for the example of the highly positively charged linker histone H1 and its highly negatively charged chaperone, prothymosin α (ProTα). Temperature-dependent single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments and isothermal titration calorimetry reveal ProTα-H1 binding to be enthalpically unfavorable, and salt-dependent affinity measurements suggest counterion release entropy to be an important thermodynamic driving force. Using single-molecule FRET, we also identify ternary complexes between ProTα and H1 in addition to the heterodimer at equilibrium and show how they contribute to the thermodynamics observed in ensemble experiments. Finally, we explain the observed thermodynamics quantitatively with a mean-field polyelectrolyte theory that treats counterion release explicitly. ProTα-H1 complex formation resembles the interactions between synthetic polyelectrolytes, and the underlying principles are likely to be of broad relevance for interactions between charged biomolecules in general.","date":"2023-10-10","libraryCatalog":"pnas.org (Atypon)","url":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304036120","accessDate":"2024-04-01T14:04:29Z","extra":"Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"120","pages":"e2304036120","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2304036120","issue":"41","journalAbbreviation":"PNAS","creators":[{"firstName":"Aritra","lastName":"Chowdhury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Borgia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Souradeep","lastName":"Ghosh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Sottini","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Soumik","lastName":"Mitra","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rohan S.","lastName":"Eapen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Madeleine B.","lastName":"Borgia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tianjin","lastName":"Yang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Galvanetto","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miloš T.","lastName":"Ivanović","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paweł","lastName":"Łukijańczuk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ruijing","lastName":"Zhu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Nettels","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Kundagrami","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Schuler","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["5Y7FL4MQ","Y8BZS579"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-04-01T14:04:29Z","dateModified":"2024-04-01T14:05:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/8E2MIWHU","itemID":7180,"attachments":[{"key":"NVD3CUS4","version":7682,"itemType":"attachment","title":"chowdhury_et_al-2023-driving_forces_of_the_complex_formation_between_highly_charged_disordered.pdf","parentItem":"8E2MIWHU","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences/chowdhury_et_al-2023-driving_forces_of_the_complex_formation_between_highly_charged_disordered.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Polymers, being inexpensive and possessing a broad range of tunable properties, are widespread in many technological applications. The vast chemical and morphological complexity of polymers though gives rise to challenges in the rational discovery of new materials for specific applications. The nascent field of polymer informatics seeks to provide tools and pathways for accelerated property prediction (and materials design) via surrogate machine learning models built on reliable past data. We have carefully accumulated a data set of organic polymers whose properties were obtained either computationally (bandgap, dielectric constant, refractive index, and atomization energy) or experimentally (glass transition temperature, solubility parameter, and density). A fingerprinting scheme that captures atomistic to morphological structural features was developed to numerically represent the polymers. Machine learning models were then trained by mapping the fingerprints (or features) to properties. Once developed, these models can rapidly predict properties of new polymers (within the same chemical class as the parent data set) and can also provide uncertainties underlying the predictions. Since different properties depend on different length-scale features, the prediction models were built on an optimized set of features for each individual property. Furthermore, these models are incorporated in a user-friendly online platform named Polymer Genome (www.polymergenome.org). Systematic and progressive expansion of both chemical and property spaces are planned to extend the applicability of Polymer Genome to a wide range of technological domains.","date":"2018-08-09","shortTitle":"Polymer Genome","libraryCatalog":"ACS Publications","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b02913","accessDate":"2022-08-24T15:16:26Z","extra":"Publisher: American Chemical Society","volume":"122","pages":"17575-17585","publicationTitle":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry C","DOI":"10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b02913","issue":"31","journalAbbreviation":"J.

The vast majority of presently adopted approaches for polymer screening rely on handcrafted chemostructural features extracted from polymer repeat units─a burdensome task as polymer libraries, which approximate the polymer chemical search space, progressively grow over time. Here, we demonstrate that directly “machine learning” important features from a polymer repeat unit is a cheap and viable alternative to extracting expensive features by hand. Our approach─based on graph neural networks, multitask learning, and other advanced deep learning techniques─speeds up feature extraction by 1–2 orders of magnitude relative to presently adopted handcrafted methods without compromising model accuracy for a variety of polymer property prediction tasks.

Surrogate models are trained on available polymer data for instant property prediction, allowing screening of promising polymer candidates with specific target property requirements. Questions regarding synthesizability, and potential (retro)synthesis steps to create a target polymer, are being explored using statistical means. Data-driven strategies to tackle unique challenges resulting from the extraordinary chemical and physical diversity of polymers at small and large scales are being explored. Other major hurdles for polymer informatics are the lack of widespread availability of curated and organized data, and approaches to create machine-readable representations that capture not just the structure of complex polymeric situations but also synthesis and processing conditions. Methods to solve inverse problems, wherein polymer recommendations are made using advanced AI algorithms that meet application targets, are being investigated.

We start out by reviewing the essential thermodynamics of ionization and show how the weak polyelectrolyte ionization differs from the ionization of simple weak acids and bases. Next, we describe simulation methods for ionization reactions, focusing on two methods: the constant-pH ensemble and the reaction ensemble. After discussing the advantages and limitations of both methods, we review the existing simulation literature. We discuss coarse-grained simulations of weak polyelectrolytes with respect to ionization equilibria, conformational properties, and the effects of salt, both in good and poor solvent conditions. This is followed by a discussion of branched star-like weak polyelectrolytes and weak polyelectrolyte gels. At the end we touch upon the interactions of weak polyelectrolytes with other polymers, surfaces, nanoparticles and proteins. Although proteins are an important class of weak polyelectrolytes, we explicitly exclude simulations of protein ionization equilibria, unless they involve protein–polyelectrolyte interactions. Finally, we try to identify gaps and open problems in the existing simulation literature, and propose challenges for future development.","date":"2019-02-06","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"pubs.rsc.org","url":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/sm/c8sm02085j","accessDate":"2024-07-08T18:34:11Z","extra":"Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry","volume":"15","pages":"1155-1185","publicationTitle":"Soft Matter","DOI":"10.1039/C8SM02085J","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"Soft Matter","ISSN":"1744-6848","creators":[{"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Landsgesell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lucie","lastName":"Nová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oleg","lastName":"Rud","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Uhlík","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Sean","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Hebbeker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Holm","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Košovan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["NR55FL52","5Y7FL4MQ","U2GY5T9P"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-08T18:34:11Z","dateModified":"2024-07-08T18:34:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/PPLNF5U5","itemID":7787,"attachments":[{"key":"8LZCZC3U","version":10029,"itemType":"attachment","title":"landsgesell_et_al-2019-simulations_of_ionization_equilibria_in_weak_polyelectrolyte_solutions_and_gels.pdf","parentItem":"PPLNF5U5","linkMode":"linked_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","path":"attachments:Journal Article/Soft Matter/landsgesell_et_al-2019-simulations_of_ionization_equilibria_in_weak_polyelectrolyte_solutions_and_gels.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-07-08T18:34:14Z","dateModified":"2024-07-08T18:34:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/4460094/items/8LZCZC3U","localPath":"/Users/samhoover/Documents/Literature/Journal Article/Soft Matter/landsgesell_et_al-2019-simulations_of_ionization_equilibria_in_weak_polyelectrolyte_solutions_and_gels.pdf","defaultPath":"files/7789/landsgesell_et_al-2019-simulations_of_ionization_equilibria_in_weak_polyelectrolyte_solutions_and_gels.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1722533095254,"version":0},"$loki":2008},{"itemID":6802,"item":{"key":"K5E4XBZB","version":8935,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Simplex Method for Function Minimization","date":"1965-01-01","language":"en","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","url":"https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308","accessDate":"2024-03-21T18:32:11Z","volume":"7","pages":"308-313","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","DOI":"10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Comput.
